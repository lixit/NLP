    "full_description": "Nigeria on Monday became the first African nation to launch a digital currency - the eNaira - a move its leaders said will expand access to banking, enable more remittances and even grow the economy by billions of dollars. Africa's most populous nation joins the Bahamas, the first to launch a general purpose central bank digital currency, known as the Sand Dollar, in October. China has ongoing trials and Switzerland and the Bank of France have announced Europe's first cross-border experiment. But experts and cryptocurrency users in the continent's biggest economy say the fact that there are more questions than answers regarding the eNaira - and a large amount of worry over the consistency of Central Bank (CBN) rules - means the government faces a tough path to make the eNaira a success. Central Bank Governor Godwin Emefiele said during Monday's launch that there had been \"overwhelming interest and encouraging response\", adding that 33 banks, 2,000 customers and 120 merchants had already registered successfully with the platform, which is available via an app on Apple and Android . Some 200 million nairas' worth of eNaira, which will maintain parity with the traditional currency, has been issued to financial institutions, he said. President Muhammadu Buhari said use of the currency could grow the economy by $29 billion (roughly Rs. 2,17,850 crores) over ten years, enable direct government welfare payments and even increase the tax base. Nigeria's young, tech-savvy population has eagerly adopted digital currencies. Cryptocurrency use has grown quickly despite a Central Bank ban in February on banks and financial institutions dealing in or facilitating transactions in them. Nigeria ranked seventh in the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index compiled by research firm Chainalysis. Official digital currencies, unlike crytocurrencies such as bitcoin, are backed and controlled by the central bank. But some of what drove Nigeria's enthusiastic adoption of cryptocurrencies was the Central Bank's own shifting rules regarding accessing foreign currency - and the naira's plunging value on parallel markets that saw savings shrink. \"It's not clear looking at the CBN's body of work that Nigerians would be comfortable using this,\" said Ikemesit Effiong, head of research with Lagos-based consultancy SBM Intelligence. He added that the CBN had not yet made clear whether users could transfer eNaira back into traditional naira, whether they could use cryptocurrency to buy or sell the eNaira or even whether there would be physical locations to use and transfer eNaira, or whether it would be entirely digital. \"There are more questions than answers, even though we are looking at the launch of this digital currency. The fact that this is the case so late in the game is concerning,\" he told Reuters. The CBN issued a nine-page FAQ, which said eNaira users would access it via the phone app, internet banking or a code dialled from mobile phones, but it did not address transferability or other questions raised by Effiong. Only three local television channels were allowed to attend the launch, and officials took no questions. For 28-year-old Ebuka Joseph, an art dealer and enthusiastic cryptocurrency user in the commercial capital, Lagos, the uncertainty means he will stay on the sidelines, for now. His concerns centre on whether he would easily be able to change eNaira back into normal currency. \"I have had issues trusting the central bank ... because they have already banned crypto,\" he told Reuters. \"I want to hear from people, see people use it, before I venture into it.\" \u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2021 .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

    "full_description": "HTC True Wireless Earbuds Plus have been reportedly launched in the UK. The new wireless earbuds come with active noise cancellation (ANC), auto-pairing feature, and touch controls for answering or rejecting calls. The earbuds have an in-ear design and an IPX5 water-resistant build. Also, the HTC True Wireless Earbuds Plus are reported to deliver up to 86 hours of battery life along with the charging case. The new earbuds are said to come in two different colour options. HTC also recently unveiled a new virtual reality (VR) headset called HTC Vive Flow. As per a report by Pocket-lint, the HTC True Wireless Earbuds Plus will go on sale starting Tuesday, 26 October 2021 priced at EUR 69 (roughly Rs. 6,000), and will be available for purchase through the HTC Vive website. As mentioned, the earphones come in Black and White colour options. However, HTC has not shared any details about the product's availability in India and other markets. On the specifications front, the HTC True Wireless Earbuds Plus are said to feature inbuilt mics for calls and active noise cancelling technology to cut out ambient sounds. Users will be able to use the earbuds independently as well. The earbuds are reported to feature touch controls for answering or rejecting calls and are IPX5-rated for water resistance. As per the report, the earbuds are said to offer up to 86 hours of total standby time with the case. They are said to offer up to 4 hours of battery life when talking using the inbuilt mics with ANC switched on and up to 4.5 hours with ANC turned off. Also, the HTC True Wireless Earbuds Plus are said to deliver up to 5.5 hours of battery life while playing music without ANC and up to 4.5 hours when ANC is switched on, says the report. The charging case is said to increase the total \u201cstandby time\u201d to 86 hours. Separately, a Gizmochina report says that HTC True Wireless Earbuds Plus are made up of silicone and have a lightweight ergonomic design. The launch of HTC True Wireless Earbuds Plus comes a few days after the company has unveiled a new virtual reality (VR) headset called HTC Vive Flow in the UK market. The VR glasses can be worn like a pair of glasses and features two cameras, adjustable diopter dials, and dual inbuilt speakers. It is compatible with the Vive app. HTC Vive Flow comes with a 75Hz refresh rate with a 100-degree field-of-view (FoV), 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of onboard memory. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

    "full_description": "While fitness trackers have been around for years, the events of the past year or two have only served to make people more acutely aware of the state that their bodies are in. The assortment of sensors in smartwatches also reveals how much of our own body\u2019s \u201coutput\u201d can be used to indirectly measure our health or even our stress levels. Staying healthy, however, isn\u2019t just a matter of keeping track of our activities and heart rates but is also a product of the food we eat. Not all of us, however, can afford personal trainers or fitness gurus, which is why Lumen is offering a relatively more accessible alternative that makes use of one bodily emission that we take for granted, the carbon dioxide that we exhale. But is the Lumen metabolism tracker worth the price it is asking for? Don\u2019t hold your breath (pun intended) as we go into the science and the tech to find out for ourselves. The majority of the personal fitness devices we have today tend to focus on tracking activities, heart health, bloody oxygen levels, and sleep quality. While good indicators of health, these figures don\u2019t always tell us what to do to improve things other than being more active or getting better sleep. Many fitness experts and trainers, however, will emphasize how diet is just as important as exercise since it significantly affects our body\u2019s metabolism or the way we convert food into energy. And that metabolism is exactly what Lumen measures in order to suggest what actions to take or, more specifically, what food to take. The science behind Lumen is based on RER or Respiratory Exchange Ratio. In a nutshell, it analyzes the CO2 that we breathe out to determine whether we\u2019re burning fat or burning carbohydrates at that time. Burning fat in the morning is normal, while carbs that early means our body is still trying to digest last night\u2019s heavy meal. Conversely, burning fat before an exercise is a recipe for disaster, and you will want carbohydrates to be your fuel source during the day. Knowing that \u201crespiratory quotient\u201d and knowing what to do to fix unbalanced ratios isn\u2019t something smartwatches and fitness trackers can answer, and it\u2019s that important niche where Lumen is trying to find its market. Since it\u2019s meant to measure the carbon dioxide you produce, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that Lumen isn\u2019t something you can wear. Its design resembles a breathalyzer or a vape device that is (somewhat ironically) on the rotund side. Its surface is mostly covered with a smooth matte material that makes it easy to hold while in use. The metal mouthpiece gives it a more premium look and feel but can also accumulate some saliva over a few weeks. As something that\u2019s meant to be used almost anywhere, including the gym, the Lumen is fortunately lightweight and compact. It does come with a USB-C powered charging stand, but you, fortunately, don\u2019t need to do that regularly. The device\u2019s battery is advertised to last for around 14 days, which is probably more than enough time before you will need to take that dock out for a quick overnight charge. Using the Lumen is habit-forming, which is both intentional but also frustrating. Like any system designed to study your habits long enough to offer personal recommendations, it takes a few days, around two weeks actually, before Lumen can actually start becoming useful. During those days, you might become impatient and even start doubting whether the metabolism tracker is all that it\u2019s cracked out to be, and it doesn\u2019t help that the experience can be a bit tedious or downright exasperating. While you can take measurements anytime during the day, there are some key moments when you\u2019re required to use the Lumen in order to actually get anything out of it. The most important moments are 30 minutes after you wake up in the morning, before you sleep, as well as before and after eating. You\u2019re also encouraged to take a measure before you exercise so that you can be advised whether you need to eat something before trying to sweat it out. It\u2019s almost too easy to forget these moments, especially when you\u2019re starting out, which is why the two-week weaning period is probably important. Unfortunately, Lumen can be pretty picky in how you do the measurements, and even the slightest excess in force or time will see you retaking the test again. The results are pretty accurate, though, which is probably why the software insists on precise measurements. It will definitely test your patience and might require more than just a few attempts to satisfy Lumen\u2019s requirements. It is, however, worth the effort when you finally start getting your scores, alerting you to whether you\u2019re burning fat or carbs at the time of the measurement. Unlike fitness trackers and more like complete fitness programs, Lumen doesn\u2019t just tell you the state of your metabolism. It also informs you what to do next, which is mostly in the form of changing your diet. #gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php */ Lumen will recommend meals that will either give you more fat or more carbs for the next activity, often to produce better metabolism flexibility so that your body can more easily switch between those fuel sources. The app and program, however, go beyond simple recommendations and can offer alternatives to certain ingredients or foods that might be allergens or might not be available locally. Even if you decide to ignore those suggestions, it could at least give you an idea of what an ideal meal should look like. Lumen also goes beyond just presenting numbers and offers information that makes sense of those. It\u2019s almost encyclopedic in explaining how body metabolism works, how certain foods affect it, and how to develop good habits to increase metabolic flexibility. These are the things you\u2019d normally pay trainers, dieticians, and doctors for, but Lumen lets you \u201chack your metabolism\u201d at a certain price, of course. The Lumen\u2019s simple, nondescript design belies the science and the technology packed inside the portable breathalyzer, not to mention the amount of knowledge you can get out of it in exchange for a few breaths. More than just the device itself, Lumen provides insights, personalized diet recommendations, and alternatives that all work together in promoting metabolic flexibility without having to hire people to keep you on your feet. Unfortunately, getting to that point involves not just a lot of testing but even more patience, as the device\u2019s algorithms can be unforgiving when determining what passes and what doesn\u2019t. The Lumen Metabolism Tracaker isn\u2019t an inexpensive personal health device either. It starts at $249 for a 6-month \u201ctrack,\u201d while a $349 purchase sets you for 18 months of personalized diet plans. After that period, you do need to subscribe to a $19 per month program, so the total cost will add up. Then again, you will probably have to pay more to hire professionals, which might not even be an option for some people anyway.",

The third-generation Audi RS 3 takes what was a fine drive and tweaks it in all areas. While the latest model is sharper looking, faster, and it has slightly more power, this time around the RS 3 puts a clear emphasis on handling and in-car technologies. Article content One of the keys to any RS model is the engine. While the patented in-line turbo-five and its distinct sound is the same basic unit as used before, it has been tweaked to broaden the powerband and increase the output. It now twists out 401 horsepower (up 7 hp) and 369 pound-feet of torque (up 15 lb-ft). The key is the latter is now available anywhere between 2,250 and 5,600 rpm, so it pulls harder through the all-important mid-range. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

First Drive: 2022 Audi RS 3 Back to video The engine drives a seven-speed, dual-clutch transmission with normal, sport, and manual modes and Audi\u2019s quattro all-wheel-drive system. In this case, quattro splits the power based on the drive mode selected. In efficiency, it is a front-driver until more traction is needed; the more dynamic modes balance the delivery of power front-to-back. The combo brings a run to 100 kilometres an hour in 3.8 seconds and a top speed of 250 km/h \u2014 290 km/h when the RS Dynamic package and ceramic brakes are aboard. Article content The drive modes cover the bases. Frankly, Efficiency is for those times when the gas warning light comes on, and while Comfort is well-suited to the city, Auto is the better choice \u2014 it picks the most appropriate mode based on driver input. Dynamic mode is for the fun times. It cranks everything up to deliver the very best the RS 3 has to offer. The plus is the variable exhaust system produces its most mellifluous tones when Dynamic mode is selected \u2014 the bark and burble is wonderful at full chat!

You may use a different browser or device to view this in full screen. OK Article content One of the handling highlights is a first in the form of the new \u201ctorque splitter\u201d rear axle setup. The previous differential and multi-plate clutch have gone in favour of two electronically-controlled clutch packs \u2014 one for each of the rear half-shafts. When pushing hard, the torque splitter increases the drive sent to the outside rear wheel in a corner and, as it\u2019s constantly assessing things, the power is delivered to the correct wheel in a timely fashion \u2014 it takes just 180-milliseconds to switch from one wheel to the other. This action significantly reduces understeer and the amount of steering input required. The RS Performance mode brings a beautifully neutral drive \u2014 it seems to make the RS 3 feel physically smaller. On the racetrack, it let this driver brake later heading into a corner and it was much faster when hauling out of it. The combination makes the RS 3 feel tighter and more alive, and it\u2019s even more so than Dynamic, which is saying something. The reason is it makes optimal use of the torque splitter \u2014 it quells oversteer as well as taming understeer. Article content More On This Topic Audi's Skysphere concept changes wheelbase in 'Sport' mode Dear Diary: How I almost made myself yack in a new BMW M The twist is the torque splitter setup has a full-on drift mode. The \u201cRS Torque Rear\u201d mode sends all of the power to one rear wheel \u2014 up to 1,291 pound-feet when the gearing is factored in. This allows the tail to be flicked out and held there until the driver\u2019s nerve quits, or they over cook it! This makes the RS 3 a seriously mean drift machine. Of course, there\u2019s a launch control mode for good measure! The test cars were all equipped with the optional RS sport suspension plus. It adds adaptive dampers that continuously change the damping according to driver input and the drive mode selected. The comfort, balanced or sport modes deliver the desired characteristics. The manic RS 3 also has a 25-millimetres lower ride height than the mortal A3. In the end, the suspension is comfortable in comfort and overtly sporty in sport. Article content For practically all of the test drive the RS 3 was in Dynamic, as it banishes body roll, sharpens the steering response and uses the torque splitter to make it feel, well, more dynamic. The key here is each facet is overseen by the modular vehicle dynamics controller (mVDC), so everything works in harmony.

Here the RS 3 dived into a decreasing radius corner and then pulled out of it in a magical manner. To say it delivers a nimble drive is a massive understatement \u2014 the car seems to become an extension of the driver such is the communication, feedback and reaction to input. The lesson learned is the car\u2019s limits are far greater than mine! The bolder exterior style flows neatly into the cabin. It is beautifully crafted and now puts a much stronger emphasis on in-car technology. Ahead of the driver sits Audi\u2019s 12.3-inch virtual cockpit plus \u2014 it is fully reconfigurable with the look changing according to the drive mode selected. It can show everything from the navigation\u2019s mapping to the g-forces, a bar-graph tachometer, and digital speed readout along with the horsepower and torque percentages. It can also show readouts for the acceleration, lap, and quarter mile times. Article content To the right sits a 10.1-inch touchscreen. It looks after all of the usual infotainment functions, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and navigation plus it can show things like coolant, engine and transmission oil temperatures, tire pressures and it gives one-touch access to the drive modes, including that hairy drift mode. The clever part is a new RS Mode button on the steering wheel gives the driver fast and easy access to the RS Performance and RS Individual modes, as well as the last mode used. 2022 Audi RS 3 Photo by Graeme Fletcher The racing-themed layout is supported by two boldly-bolstered RS front bucket seats. While the support they deliver is ideal, anyone with a larger posterior may find them a tad tight. Finally, there\u2019s a three-spoke, flat-bottomed steering wheel that includes a stripe at the 12 o\u2019clock position \u2014 this is an old racer\u2019s trick that gives a visual reference to the steering wheel\u2019s position. Article content One of the few interior nits is found in the controller that sits to the right of the shifter \u2014 for the most part it looks after the sound system. When compared to the logic and ease of use that define the other functions it comes across as being a bit ham-fisted. Thankfully there are steering wheel-mounted controls. There was little wrong with the outgoing RS 3. The third-generation brings a much nicer cabin, better power and a significant improvement in the handling. It is a blinder of a drive that pegs the smile-per-mile metre at maximum! The Audi RS 3 sedan will land in Canada in the second-quarter of 2022. Pricing and full specifications will be available closer to the launch date.",

    "full_description": "Frank Stippler makes drifting look easy. It\u2019s after dark in the deserted docklands outside Athens, where a spotlit circle bordered by red-glowing barrier blocks has been set up. He smoothly circles the ring of cones, white wisps coming from the rear tyres of the new Audi RS3 . It\u2019s harder to do than the race and development driver makes it look. Getting sideways is simple, but circling while smoking takes skill. Yes, the RS3 now has drift mode. Audi calls it RS Torque Rear, but it enables drifting and more. Since the first RS3 in 2011, the offbeat, raspy note of its signature five-cylinder turbo has made it different from other elite-level hot hatches. They all have familiar-sounding turbo fours. More recently, the Audi\u2019s lack of drift mode became another point of contrast. The Ford Focus RS , launched in Australia in 2016, was first. In 2019 the Mercedes-AMG A45 S followed suit. When Audi surveyed RS3 customers while planning the new model many requested drift mode. Audi\u2019s system relies on the same kind of twin-clutch rear axle as the others. The clutches in RS3\u2019s rear axle mean some or all of the engine\u2019s output can be channelled through one rear wheel, both wheels equally, or any percentage between. With both clutches locked, grip during foot-flat takeoffs from standstill is enhanced. Audi claims the new RS3 can rip from 0-100km/h in just 3.8 seconds. This is only three-tenths of a second less than the old model, but it\u2019s enough to make the Audi an eyeblink quicker than its Mercedes-AMG rival. Pushing more power through one or the other rear wheels, the axle also improves safety and handling. It can curb both tail-end slides and front-end ploughing. Changes to the engine are minor. The 2.5 TFSI now punches out 294kW. This is 16kW less than the 2.0-litre turbo four in the Mercedes-AMG A45 S, but Audi\u2019s turbo five matches it for torque. The RS3 has a seven-speed double-clutch transmission while the A45 S has an eight-speeder. But the numbers that count for more with hot hatch lovers are the Audi\u2019s hyper-competitive 0-100km/h and Nurburgring lap times, where it is five seconds faster than its predecessor. The short but bumpy racetrack rented for the RS3\u2019s international media launch wasn\u2019t exactly the Nurburgring, but it did reveal the quality of its chassis set-up, at least on the optional-for-Europe adaptive shock absorbers. The RS3 also has a wide-track front suspension and all-round lower ride height than the sporty S3. As well as RS Torque Rear, there\u2019s another new driving mode. Called RS Performance, it\u2019s intended for use on circuits both smooth and rough. The Audi wasn\u2019t thrown offline by lumps in the Greek track, and could really put down power out of its bends. The steering feels lifeless, but the brakes are brilliant, the transmission is excellent and ruthless pace of the RS3 is awesome. RS Performance is more supple than the car\u2019s super-stiff Dynamic mode, and probably better suited for quick public road driving. There\u2019s also a new Efficiency mode that cuts engine output by 20 per cent, and is likely to be used only by the RS3 driver running low on fuel and far from a service station. Pumped-out front guards and a big black grille give the RS3 plenty of hot hatch attitude on the outside, but the inside is better. With body-coloured strips in the face-level air vents, hip-hugging front seats and an Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel it brings a tasteful level of bling to the practical and very well equipped interior. The new RS3 Sportback and sedan go on sale in Europe this month. They will reach Australia in the first half of next year. Expect the price list to begin at about $90,000 for the hatch, without options. Audi RS3 Sportback Price: $90,000 (est) Engine: 2.5-litre 5-cyl turbo; 294kW/500Nm Safety: Auto emergency braking, lane-keeping and blind-spot assist, adaptive cruise, rear cross-traffic alert, vehicle exit alert Thirst: 8.3-8.8L/100km Performance: 0-100KM/H in 3.8 secs This European family-hauler draws in buyers with its good looks, stylish cabin and there are more than a few surprises for interested drivers. There is a secret hiding underneath Mazda\u2019s tough work ute that it shares with one of the most popular and capable dual-cabs on the market. Australians can\u2019t get enough of this family-hauler with sales through the roof and a long waiting list. We find out why it\u2019s so popular.",

    "description": "The UK\u2019s three spy agencies have contracted AWS, Amazon\u2019s cloud computing arm, to host classified material in a deal aimed at boosting the use of data analytics and artificial intelligence for espionage. The procurement of a high-security cloud system has been championed by GCHQ, the UK\u2019s signals intelligence body, and will be used by sister services MI5 and MI6, as well as other government departments such as the Ministry of Defence during joint operations. The contract is likely to ignite concerns over sovereignty given that a vast amount of the UK\u2019s most secret data will be hosted by a single US tech company. The agreement, estimated by industry experts to be worth \u00a3500 million to \u00a31 billion over the next decade, was signed this year, according to four people familiar with the discussions. However, the details are closely guarded and were not intended to be made public. Although AWS is a US company, all the agencies\u2019 data will be held in Britain, according to those with knowledge of the deal. Amazon will not have any access to information held on the cloud platform, those people said. Jeremy Fleming, GCHQ director, has previously said that making use of AI will be \u201cat the heart\u201d of his agency\u2019s transformation to keep the country safe as spying moves into a digital age. Top secret The new cloud service \u2013 designed to host top-secret information securely \u2013 will enable spies to share data more easily from field locations overseas and power specialist applications such as speech recognition which can \u201cspot\u201d and translate particular voices from hours\u2019 worth of intercept recordings. It will also allow GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 to conduct faster searches on each other\u2019s databases. GCHQ told the Financial Times it would not discuss its business relationships with technology suppliers. AWS declined to comment. Ciaran Martin, who stepped down last year as head of the UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, a branch of GCHQ, said the cloud deal would allow the security services \u201cto get information from huge amounts of data in minutes, rather than in weeks and months\u201d. However, he dismissed suggestions that the system would affect the amount of information held by intelligence agencies. \u201cThis is not about collecting or hoarding more data,\u201d he said. \u201cThe obvious business case is to use existing large amounts of data more effectively.\u201d Gus Hosein, executive director of Privacy International and an expert in technology and human rights, said there were \u201cmany things\u201d that parliament, regulators and the public needed to know about the deal. \u201cThis is yet another worrying public-private partnership, agreed in secret\u201d, he said. \u201cIf this contract goes through, Amazon will be positioned as the go-to cloud provider for the world\u2019s intelligence agencies. Amazon has to answer for itself which countries\u2019 security services it would be prepared to work for.\u201d While the agreement is a first of its kind for the UK, Britain\u2019s security apparatus is lagging behind its US peers in use of commercial cloud services. The CIA signed its first $600 million cloud contract with AWS in 2013, on behalf of all the US intelligence agencies. This cloud provision was upgraded last year under a new deal with a consortium comprising AWS, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, and IBM. Admiral Mike Rogers, former head of the US National Security Agency, said the move to cloud storage had helped intelligence officers zero in on potential suspects. \u201cIt gives us speed, it gives us flexibility, and by being able to aggregate more data, it increases the possibility that you\u2019re going to identify that needle in the haystack,\u201d he said. The UK\u2019s move to contract a US company surprised some experts. \u201cSovereignty matters and there\u2019s a reason why, historically, security technology has always been built and maintained in-house,\u201d one security veteran said. GCHQ initially wanted to find a UK cloud provider but it became clear in recent years that domestic companies would be unable to offer either the scale or capabilities needed, said two people familiar with the deal. Mr Martin acknowledged that contracting an overseas vendor meant that \u201ccontrolling and restricting vendor access to data is extremely important\u201d. \u201cBut as long as the company is from a reliable country, with technology you understand, there are ways of doing this which will enable the agencies to manage the risk,\u201d he said.

Alongside the new MacBook Pro models, Apple has pushed the availability of the AirPods (3rd generation) to October 29. Both MacBook Pro (2021) and AirPods (3rd generation) were originally announced to be available in India from Tuesday, October 26. Apple unveiled the new devices as significant upgrades to its earlier offerings at the \u2018Unleashed' virtual event last week. The Apple India website now carries a banner with the listing for the 14-inch MacBook Pro (2021) and 16-inch MacBook Pro (2021) that show October 29 as the new availability date for the next-generation models.

Unlike India, the new MacBook Pro models and AirPods (3rd generation) are set to be available for purchase in the US as per their original October 26 schedule. Gadgets 360 has reached out to Apple India for clarity on the delay in the availability of the MacBook Pro (2021) models and the AirPods (3rd generation) in the country. MacBook Pro (2021) price in India starts at Rs. 1,94,900 for the 14-inch variant. The 16-inch model of the new MacBook Pro carries a starting price tag of Rs. 2,39,900. The new MacBook Pro models start at $1,999 (roughly Rs. 1,50,100) in the US. The AirPods (3rd generation) price in India is set at Rs. 18,500. In the US, the new AirPods come at $179 (roughly Rs. 13,400). The MacBook Pro (2021) comes in 14- and 16-inch display options and both feature Apple's Liquid Retina XDR display, which is backed by mini-LED technology. The displays on the new MacBook Pro laptops deliver up to 120Hz adaptive refresh rate using the company's proprietary ProMotion technology that was earlier available on the iPad Pro models. Under the hood, both MacBook Pro (2021) models can be equipped with the new M1 Pro or M1 Max chips that include up to 10-core CPU and up to 32-core GPU. Apple has also tweaked the design of the new MacBook Pro models with a notch on top of the display. It has removed the Touch Bar from the new models and added an SDXC card slot and an HDMI port. The new models now include physical function keys in place of the Touch Bar along with a wider escape key. The MacBook Pro (2021) models run on macOS Monterey out-of-the-box. The new macOS operating system, which is now also available for older models , brings an enhanced user experience to the new MacBook Pro. It includes features such as AirPlay to Mac, Live Text, and Visual Lookup, as well as an updated Safari browser. The AirPods (3rd generation) come in a design that looks similar to the AirPods Pro. There are smaller stems over the existing AirPods, along with a Force sensor for pressure controls. The new AirPods also include support for Dolby Atmos and spatial audio in Apple Music. Further, there is Adaptive EQ support to adjust sound on the basis of how the earbuds fit in the user's ear. Apple claims that the AirPods (3rd generation) deliver an additional hour of battery life over the previous generation, with up to six hours of listening time and up to four hours of talk time. The new model also includes a charging case that supports Apple's MagSafe protocol. The bundled case is said to expand the battery life to a total of 30 hours.",

    "full_description": "Women who work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are often underpaid, under-represented and unsupported, according to a new nationwide survey. Professionals Australia\u2019s \u2018Women Staying in The STEM Workforce\u2019 report found that women in the professional, scientific and technical services industry faced a gender pay gap of 22 per cent when compared to their male counterparts. This is significantly higher than Australia\u2019s national average pay gap of 14.2 per cent. Women in STEM also frequently felt that they needed to \u201cprove themselves\u201d at work because of their gender, with 62 per cent saying that in their occupation, women have to prove their skills where men are assumed to be capable. Professionals Australia CEO Jill McCabe said the report\u2019s findings were consistent with her own career journey and experience in the workplace. \u201cThose who work part-time or flexibly are often seen as less committed to their careers. Being part-time also cuts you off from a lot of progression opportunities,\u201d she said. \u201cThis creates a vicious cycle where fewer women make it into senior, hiring positions and, as a result, fewer women in the workforce have access to professional development or are promoted to more senior roles.\u201d Women represent just 29 per cent of the university-qualified STEM workforce, and Professionals Australia warned this number was unlikely to rapidly increase anytime soon. Over one-third of the female STEM workforce surveyed, aged 25 to 35, intended to leave their profession within five years, according to the report. Female employees in STEM also experienced higher job losses during the Covid-19 crisis than their male colleagues. Ms McCabe said the report\u2019s findings indicated that the Covid-19 pandemic had intensified the attrition of women from STEM fields, and urgent action needed to be taken. \u201cThe survey found that many women in STEM planned to leave the industry, with pay, conditions and a lack of career advancement among the top reasons for doing so. The pandemic has also created a further \u2018push\u2019 factor,\u201d she said. \u201cThis confirms that we need urgent organisational changes to ensure the retention of women in STEM fields and that increasing the number of female STEM graduates alone isn\u2019t enough. \u201cUrgently addressing the gender pay gap and the organisational factors behind the attrition of women from STEM fields must be part of any plan to rebuild the STEM workforce for an equitable post-Covid future.\u201d Young doctors who have joined class actions against the Victorian public hospital system claim excessive workloads are putting patients\u2019 lives at risk. Bosses across Australia have revealed what they expect the new working week to look like, and it\u2019s good news if you like working from home.

    "pubDate": "2021-10-26 06:38:53",
    "full_description": "In the South Korean Netflix hit Squid Game , 456 heavily indebted characters are plunged into murderous children\u2019s games for a chance to win \u00a328 million ($51.5 million). The likes of \u201cgrandma\u2019s footsteps\u201d and tug of war are turned gory as contestants try to survive long enough to claim a share of the prize. Its viral success has prompted an escalation of a not quite so life-or-death, but decades-long dispute between telecoms giants and big tech over net neutrality. Almost as old as the internet itself, net neutrality is the concept that internet providers should give equal access to all content, regardless of the product or website. The Squid Game\u2019s viral success has prompted an escalation of a decades-long dispute between telecoms giants and big tech over net neutrality. Essentially, the question is: who pays for the internet? Broadband providers cannot charge Netflix more, simply because the 142 million people streaming Squid Game are hogging all the bandwidth. But that could be about to change. South Korean network provider SK Broadband sued Netflix earlier this month, demanding it cough up for delivering Squid Game - the court ordered the parties to agree on a payment, although Netflix is appealing. In the US, net neutrality has been a hot political issue. Hundreds of millions in lobbying fees crossed both sides of the debate as tech and telecoms firms waged war, while internet activists took to the streets to protest, defending the web. And in the UK, current rules face a potential shake-up. As revealed by The Sunday Telegraph in March, Ofcom is reviewing whether regulations should change amid pressure from telecoms companies, to force tech giants to contribute to the tens of billions being spent on broadband upgrades. A call for evidence will close in November. The review is still in its information gathering stage and no decisions have been made. The dispute has heated up, largely spearheaded by Marc Allera, chief executive of EE, who said in March: \u201cWe ask ourselves: are current net neutrality laws fit for purpose?\u201d EE argues that, at times, 80 per cent of internet traffic is being driven by just four big tech firms. \u201cYou can understand the motivation [from telecoms companies],\u201d says Paul Bernal, a professor of IT law at the University of East Anglia. \u201cThey think: \u2018hang on, Netflix is making billions out of our infrastructure. It should pay its way.\u2019,\u201d But the logic behind their demands falls flat, he says. When a hit like Squid Game or the next Call of Duty is launched, people buy a better broadband package, boosting revenues for telecoms firms. Forcing Netflix to pay more is like getting paid twice for providing the same service. Still, these network operators believe there are tweaks to net neutrality that regulators may be open to. Ofcom has said it would examine the impact of net neutrality on investment, on new technology such as 5G and gaming, and on zero rating - the process of giving away some services for free. The last area is one that demands more clarity. During the pandemic, mobile networks were under pressure to \u201czero rate\u201d education websites as students were forced to study from home, despite it not generally being permitted under net neutrality rules. The UK did it anyway, on a de facto basis with websites such as the NHS, and Ofcom did not intervene. In fact, the regulator has always been quite light on \u201czero rating\u201d, allowing several operators to offer social media apps free traffic that doesn\u2019t count towards users\u2019 data allowance. But telecoms are likely to push for further change. \u201cThey want more freedom to have a more commercial relationship with content providers,\u201d says Matthew Howett, founder of consultancy Assembly Research. That could, he says, see \u201coperators striking deals with games makers to prioritise a particular update or traffic\u201d. Broadband insiders say gaming giants should be required to work with networks when they are planning to deliver huge software updates, so these can be managed efficiently - for example, so the next Call of Duty download doesn\u2019t clash with an England match. But tech companies are suspicious, especially after bruising battles in the US. They fear any watering down of net neutrality could cause networks to slow down their services unfairly. And streaming companies argue they already invest heavily in technology that stops their traffic overwhelming mobile and broadband networks. \u201cNetflix invests millions in content delivery networks to get its traffic to you,\u201d says Howett. The real overriding problem, critics say, is that networks have not invested enough in fibre and 5G until now, meaning bottlenecks will continue until the infrastructure catches up with our increasingly online world. After years of trying, UK telecoms have finally got net neutrality back on the agenda, made known by Squid Game . For them to push through even a few tweaks would be toasted as a win.

    "full_description": "Sony on Tuesday launched its Xperia Pro-I smartphone which comes with a professional-grade camera setup for photography . The smartphone packs a 1-inch camera sensor which is the same sensor that is used in the company\u2019s RX100 VII point-and-shoot camera. The main camera sensor on the Sony Pro-I has 2.4\u00b5m-sized pixels, which should improve low light photography. The device is backed by ZEISS Tessar Optics and it is capable of capturing 12-bit RAW files and native 4K video at 120 frames per second with eye-detection auto-focus. As far as auto-focus is concerned, it comes with 315 points that cover 90 percent of the frame. The Pro-I also comes with one of Sony\u2019s BIONZ X imaging processors, which allows the smartphone to shoot up to 20 frames per second with both auto-focus and auto-exposure enabled. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png The fast readout speed of the sensor allows it to avoid a rolling shutter effect. The smartphone comes with a 24mm lens made from glass. It also comes with variable aperture that can switch between f/2.0 and f/4.0 apertures. Other cameras on the Sony Xperia Pro-I include a 16mm ultrawide camera and a 50mm telephoto camera.

As outlined in a recent, in-depth analysis on the connected TV business from reporters Jessica Toonkel and Sahil Patel, Google has increased the amount it is willing to pay TV manufacturers to install its software on connected devices. The Information reports Google is willing to pay manufacturers from $10 to $15 per unit, compared to Roku\u2019s $7 to $8 per unit fee. Google\u2019s push was successful enough to capture the business of Chinese TV manufacturer TCL. TCL, which is best known for its partnership with Roku, said it would start making TVs that feature Google\u2019s OS. (TCL is also making private label TVs for Amazon in a manufacturing partnership.)

Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg \u00a9 2020 Bloomberg Finance LP As American households continue to the cut the cord, competition in the connected TV space has heated up between Roku, Amazon, Google and Apple. These companies also compete TV manufacturers that have created their own platforms, including Vizio, LG and Samsung.

Connected TV platforms get to decide whether Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ and the like can offer their apps to consumers. In exchange, connected TV platforms take a cut of subscription revenue, advertising inventory or both. In some cases, connected TV platforms have not budged on distribution. In fact, Google\u2019s YouTube has threatened to pull its apps off Roku to new downloads after December 9, as both sides attempt to negotiate a new distribution agreement. Google was early on its vision of a set-up box or streaming stick when it launched Google TV in 2010, in partnership with Sony, Intel and Logitech.

    "description": "Asian stocks largely rallied on Tuesday, following Wall Street\u2019s record highs overnight, though fresh worries about China\u2019s property sector weighed on investors\u2019 sentiments. Europe and US markets look set to keep the upward momentum as FTSE futures and E-mini futures for the S&P 500 index were up 0.06 per cent and 0.24per cent respectively at 0531 GMT. MSCI\u2019s gauge of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan rose 0.15 per cent and briefly touched its highest in six weeks on Tuesday, after gaining throughout October. The Asian regional benchmark however is down about 11 per cent from its February high compared to the MSCI world equity index which is in sight of its record high hit six weeks ago. \u201cEquity prices are likely to be driven by technical positioning this week, as trade enters the final week of the month,\u201d said Anderson Alves, an equities trader at global online trading platform ActivTrades. Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei average gained nearly 1.8 per cent , while Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 closed 0.03 per cent higher. The CSI300 index inched 0.05 per cent higher led by information technology stocks, but the Hong Kong benchmark Hang Seng Index eased 0.4per cent . Evergrande crisis China property stocks extended their losses in the afternoon sessions as another developer, Modern land, defaulted on a payment, adding to worries about spiralling effects of the debt crisis at China Evergrande Group. An index of Hong Kong-listed mainland property firms dropped 4.7 per cent and the mainland\u2019s CSI 300 Real Estate Index was down 2.4 per cent . China has said it will roll out a pilot real estate tax in some regions, adding to existing investor concerns about real estate in the mainland. Edison Pun, Senior Market Analyst at Saxo Markets in Hong Kong noted that markets remained on a strong trend, having begun digesting the prospect that the US Federal Reserve will begin tapering its monetary stimulus in November. \u201cHowever, we need to watch whether it will put on extra pressure on the Chinese property market when the property tax is rolled out. It could hurt consumption in the end if we are seeing an overall downturn in Chinese property prices,\u201d he said. A large proportion of S&P 500 companies are due to report results this week, including technology heavyweights Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, which have been the drivers of the market rally this year. \u201cOf the S&P 500 firms that have reported this season, the net surprise on earnings has been 13 per cent. So it is easy to understand the optimism percolating through risk appetite despite inflation fears,\u201d said ANZ Research in a note. \u201cThe economy remains very strong. We expect the recovery will re-accelerate once bottlenecks and Covid concerns subside.\u201d The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan are both set to hold monetary policy meetings on Thursday, although neither are expected to take major action on interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 closed at record highs on Monday. Tesla, which jumped 12.66 per cent and breached $1 trillion in market capitalisation, also provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Benchmark 10-year US Treasury notes were steady at 1.6397 per cent off last week\u2019s five month top of 1.7 per cent as uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve would raise rates to curb rising inflation weighed on market sentiment. The dollar rose 0.1 per cent on Tuesday, recovering from a near one-month trough hit during the previous session. Already nudging multi-year highs, oil prices rose marginally in a market gripped by tight global supply and strengthening fuel demand in the United States and beyond. Brent crude futures pared earlier losses to stand at $86.11 a barrel, up 0.14 per cent, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged 0.01 per cent higher to $83.76 a barrel.

The Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 closed at record highs on Monday. Tesla, which jumped 12.66 per cent and breached $1 trillion in market capitalisation, also provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Benchmark 10-year US Treasury notes were steady at 1.6397 per cent off last week\u2019s five month top of 1.7 per cent as uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve would raise rates to curb rising inflation weighed on market sentiment. The dollar rose 0.1 per cent on Tuesday, recovering from a near one-month trough hit during the previous session. Already nudging multi-year highs, oil prices rose marginally in a market gripped by tight global supply and strengthening fuel demand in the United States and beyond. Brent crude futures pared earlier losses to stand at $86.11 a barrel, up 0.14 per cent, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged 0.01 per cent higher to $83.76 a barrel. Spot gold was down nearly 0.2 per cent to around $1,804 per ounce. \u2013 Reuters",

    "full_description": "Vazirani Automotive has unveiled its new hypercar, Ekonk. The electric vehicle is making some noise in the automobile sector, as it claims to be the fastest made-in-India car. The company also claims that it is the lightest electric vehicle in the world. The car weighs just 738kg while producing a total output of 712bhp. The car reached a top speed of 309kmph in a test drive by Chunky Vazirani, the founder and CEO of Vazirani Automotive. The rear-wheel-drive car is made of carbon fibre that makes it lighter than its other competitors. The Ekonk enters the limelight after the company unveiled its first hypercar Shul in 2018. The Ekonk is an important testbed for the company's newly developed battery technology, which is dubbed as DiCo. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } The new electric car received its name from the Indian scriptures, where \u201cekonk\u201d signifies the beginning of creation, as per the company. Vazirani said , \u201cFor us, Ekonk signifies our real beginning, where, for the first time, design and innovation come together. It's our first vehicle that's alive.\u201d The company states, \u201cIn the Indian scriptures, Ekonk signifies the beginning of the divine light. The big bang.\u201d The official website also states that the company's \u201cdesign team worked in coherence with the engineering team to create a low drag concept car.\u201d Various factors make the Ekonk as lightweight as it is. The car is a single-seater. It does not have a car roof and a windshield. This makes it an open-cockpit vehicle. Most electric vehicles add 600kg to 700kg of weight through a heavyweight cooling system for the batteries. But the Ekonk uses DiCo technology, which discards the use of a heavy piping structure to cool the batteries and replaces it with the principle of air cooling. This significantly reduces the weight of the car. The EV's light weight not only makes it more efficient but also enables its high speed. The Ekonk boasts a sharp nose in the front, which is an aerodynamic feature that helps the car cut through air without much resistance. On the left side of the driver's seat is an air vent that pops out of the body to deliver air to the batteries. During the test, the Ekonk did a 0\u2013100kmph sprint in 2.54 seconds, making it one of the fastest accelerating cars in the world. The car's look is as dramatic as its functional features. It has got full-width LED lights bars on it, one in the front and five in the rear. The car's rear wheels are covered and flaunt the word \"Ek\", which means \"one\" in Hindi. The rear features an open design, perhaps for an exit route for its air-cooled battery technology.",

    "full_description": "Tesla became the latest US tech giant to hit $1 trillion (roughly Rs. 75,05,550 crore) in market value as investors cheered a large order from Hertz and shrugged off criticism from a US auto safety official. Shares of Elon Musk's company finished at $1,024.86 (roughly Rs. 77,030), up 12.7 percent and topping $1 trillion (roughly Rs. 75,05,550 crore) for the first time. \"Wild $T1mes!\" Musk said on Twitter . Wild $T1mes! The surge followed an announcement from rental car giant Hertz of an order to buy 100,000 autos from Tesla by the end of 2022 in the latest embrace of electric car technology by a mainstream auto player. The Hertz announcement came on the heels of strong Tesla earnings last week that illustrated the company's resilience in spite of a semiconductor shortage that has weighed more heavily on other automakers. Leading analysts at Morgan Stanley upped their target on Tesla to $1,200 (roughly Rs. 90,180) from $894 (roughly Rs. 67,190), pointing to the company's \"extraordinary\" revenue in the last quarter despite supply chain problems. The Morgan Stanley note predicted Tesla over the next 12 to 18 months will \"demonstrate the capabilities of the Trillion dollar Tesla,\" as it ramps up production and expands its capacity, model offerings and service offerings. Safety board criticism Monday's rally overlooked a letter from the National Transportation Safety Board castigating Musk for not implementing key recommendations to safeguard the automaker's driver assistance programs. In a September 2017 report on a fatal incident a year earlier in Florida, the NTSB concluded that Tesla's driver assistance system was prone to being employed on roads for which it was not designed. Tesla's programme also failed to detect signs the driver was disengaged. The agency urged Tesla to incorporate safeguards to limit the system to areas for which it was intended and to alert the driver when he or she became disengaged. The other five automakers that received the NTSB's recommendations responded and outlined the steps they were taking. \"Tesla is the only manufacturer that did not officially respond to us about the recommendations,\" wrote NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy. Homendy described a second fatal crash in California in 2018 that also took place in a roadway not meant for the driver assistance system and with an operator who was disengaged. \"Our crash investigations involving your company's vehicles have clearly shown the potential for misuse requires a system design change to ensure safety,\" Homendy said. But investors gave more weight to the announcement from Hertz. The car rental giant, which emerged from a bankruptcy reorganisation earlier this year, said the electric vehicles (EV) would be available \"in US major markets and select cities in Europe\" beginning in early November, according to a press release. \"Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,\" said interim Hertz Chief Executive Mark Fields. The deal with Hertz is \"a huge win\" for Tesla, Briefing.com said on its website. \"Beyond the windfall from the order itself, the availability of 100,000 new Model 3s on Hertz' lots is like a direct marketing campaign for Tesla,\" Briefing said. \"After being introduced to Tesla for the first time, some of those Hertz customers may ultimately turn into Tesla customers. Additionally, the deal represents another milestone in the broader adoption of EVs, while also opening up an entirely new market for Tesla.\" .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

    "full_description": "In 1993, Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park introduced the world to dinosaurs like never before. While researchers were interested in the reptile that occupied Earth hundreds of millions of years ago, the movie made people curious about it. Since then, technological advancements have let scientists uncover deep-buried facts about dinosaurs. Today, whatever we know about them, we know through fossils. There still remained one area where fossil studies were unable to reveal much about \u2014 the social behaviour of dinosaurs. However, a set of recently discovered fossils has provided a rare insight into the social lives of one dinosaur \u2014 the herbivore Mussaurus patagonicus. After studying the fossils, found in a sag basin in southern Patagonia (Argentina, South America), scientists concluded that the occurrence of many fossils of dinosaurs at different life stages within a square kilometre suggests they lived in herds nearly 190 million years ago (the fossils have been dated to 192 million years ago). The researchers also think the social cohesion of the Mussaurus may have helped it survive longer. \u201cMost specimens were found in a restricted area and stratigraphic interval, with some articulated skeletons grouped in clusters of individuals of approximately the same age. Our new discoveries indicate the presence of social cohesion throughout life and age-segregation within a herd structure, in addition to colonial nesting behaviour,\u201d the researchers said . The researchers studied the skeletal specimens of 80 individuals, ranging from embryos to eggs and infants to fully-grown adults. They also found evidence of individuals having formed age-based subgroups within the community. This was not unique, however. Many existing animals with notable differences in body size segregate themselves based on age. Living in a tightly knit group of the same body size allows animals to better arrange for their food and other behaviour.",

    "description": "On the pavement outside the front door of the National Maternity Hospital on Holles Street, a neonatal nurse and neonatal doctor are preparing to clamber into a waiting ambulance that is adapted for the transport of critically ill newborn babies. As consultant neonatologist Prof John Murphy walks by, he stops to have a quick word about what has been a busy week for this transport team, which can be mobilised within 20 minutes of a call. The three Dublin maternity hospitals take turns to supply specialist staff for the National Neonatal Transport Programme and this is the NMH\u2019s week on, with the crew about to depart for Cork, having been to Sligo the day before. I couldn\u2019t believe it. A baby that was very blue and unwell suddenly going very pink; the change was so dramatic. That was a key, life-saving event It\u2019s now a 24/7 transport service, in no small part thanks to Murphy who, as clinical lead for the National Clinical Programme for Paediatrics and Neonatology, oversaw its expansion from a 9am-5pm operation. This speedy, specialised transfer of infants to the Republic\u2019s four tertiary neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) \u2013 three in Dublin, one in Cork \u2013 is one of many innovations in the care of newborns over recent decades that have all played a part in the saving of thousands of fragile lives. Back in 1970, for every 1,000 live births in Ireland, 13 babies would die within the first month. By 2019, that rate had dropped to two per 1,000 live births. \u201cFor every 1,000 births, an additional 11 babies now go home alive,\u201d says Murphy, whose 35 years as a neonatologist in the NMH and Temple Street hospital have spanned many advances in the care of newborns. For instance, he can still remember, in 1992, giving the first dose of surfactant, which \u201clooks like skim milk\u201d and helps babies with immature lungs to breathe. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. A baby that was very blue and unwell suddenly going very pink; the change was so dramatic. That was a key, life-saving event, one of the keys that unlocked the door to survival of small babies. You could put a tube into their windpipe and give it to them and that made their lungs very flexible and that had a huge impact on mortality.\u201d Tiny babies of just 23 weeks\u2019 gestation now have a fighting chance of life, while the survival rate for those who reach 26 weeks before birth is close on 80 per cent. Murphy was \u201csurprised and flattered\u201d to be this year\u2019s recipient of the Kathleen Lynn Medal, awarded by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (RCPI) for \u201cexceptional service on behalf of children\u201d. Nevertheless, in this interview to mark the occasion, he is quick to deflect any reflection of personal achievement and instead welcomes it as \u201cvery good recognition of neonatology, which is not necessarily the most widely known speciality. I think a lot of people don\u2019t know it exists \u2013 until they get a small baby who is sick,\u201d he says, sitting in a boardroom at the top of NMH offices on Mount Street. Once you meet a level of survival and your specialty matures, you begin to look at the quality of survival, that is what you are really after Neonatology is a speciality in medical and nursing care that only began to emerge in the 1960s. Other professionals, including dietitians, pharmacists, psychologists and clinical engineers who maintain NICUs\u2019 complex equipment, now have vital roles in the field too. Covering the care of all babies from birth until one month of age, he describes neonatology as \u201cthe \u2018human turnstile\u2019 through which everyone passes\u201d, as we adapt to life outside the womb. About 10 per cent of babies require admission to a special care baby unit, although the time spent there may range from hours to several months. The death of baby Patrick Bouvier Kennedy in August 1963, just three months before his father, US president John F Kennedy, was assassinated, kickstarted huge investment into research around prematurity. Jacqueline Kennedy, who missed her husband\u2019s trip to Ireland earlier that summer due to the pregnancy, had to have a Caesarean section to deliver their infant son 5\u00bd weeks early. Suffering from respiratory distress syndrome, he lived only 39 hours, despite access to the best medical care the US could offer at the time. Today, he would be a very routine case in any neonatal unit. Although 7 per cent of babies born in Ireland are premature, defined as less than 37 weeks\u2019 gestation, \u201conly about 1-2 per cent of those are really immature and going to cause all the problems\u201d, says Murphy. Initially, neonatology was all about saving lives but its focus has broadened to trying to minimise lifelong effects of a baby\u2019s early departure from its mothership. The brain is the new frontier in the constant quest for improved neonatal care.

Rather, it is the immaturity of their organs. Also, their skin is thin, resulting in a \u201clobster red\u201d appearance and making them liable to rapid loss of heat and water, as well as open to infections. Murphy, described as \u201ca true prince of neonatology and paediatrics in Ireland\u201d in the award citation delivered by Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland -Bahrain vice-president and fellow paediatrician Prof Alf Nicholson, traces his choice of career back to childhood. At home in Cork city he used to watch Dr Finlay\u2019s Casebook, a 1960s TV series about a doctor working in the fictional Scottish town of Tannochbrae. \u201cI saw him one day going into a house and seeing a child who was sick and making a diagnosis of meningitis. Then doing a lumbar puncture and the child got better; I thought, \u2018I\u2019m going to do that\u2019.\u201d He successfully applied to study medicine at University College Cork. During medical training, the sight of a baby with apnoea breathing irregularly, made a big impression on him. There was no treatment for it at the time and it made him think if only there was something that could be done. That was before the administration of caffeine was discovered to be really effective for treating this condition, by improving the contracting of the diaphragm. After several years of further training in the UK, Murphy was the first consultant neonatologist appointed in Wales, before returning to Ireland in 1986 to become one of three at the NMH. Since then, big changes he has worked through include the handling of sensory issues in neonatal care. \u201cThere was a time when people were probably less aware of pain in babies. My rule of thumb is that if I find something painful, the baby is jolly well going to find it painful too.\u201d We have these quiet hours where all the lights go out in the unit and everybody speaks in a whisper and activity goes right down so the babies can rest Loud noises can be very upsetting for these babies who cannot yet filter stimuli. \u201cThe modern intensive care unit is a quiet place. No hoovers are allowed in, the floor must be brushed; phones are put on a light system so less noisy. \u201cThen we have these quiet hours where all the lights go out in the unit and everybody speaks in a whisper and activity goes right down so the babies can rest.\u201d Things that have to be done for a baby, such as taking a blood sample, a swab, changing a nappy, are planned, to reduce the number of disturbances. \u201cIt\u2019s all an attempt to replicate what goes on in the womb, which is really protective, but also to recognise that over-stimulation of these babies may have consequences on their development.\u201d Another simple intervention has been the placement of preterm babies in a plastic bag immediately after birth to keep them warm before transfer to an incubator. They can lose up to 1 degree Celsius a minute and when once, he recalls, theatre and corridor windows were hastily closed in an effort to alleviate heat loss, this \u201cphenomenal technique\u201d now does a very effective job. He\u2019s also seen the introduction of nitric oxide gas for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome and improvements in minimising brain injuries in preterms through the giving of steroids to mothers at risk of premature delivery. Tracking how these babies fare after they are discharged is vital. At the NMH, the neonatal department\u2019s clinical development psychologist Marie Slevin sees all premature babies back at two years of age for what is known as the Bayley assessment, looking at cognitive skills and speech and language development. Prof John Murphy is this year\u2019s recipient of the Kathleen Lynn Medal, awarded by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland for \u2018exceptional service on behalf of children\u2019. Photograph: Dara Mac D\u00f3naill \u201cIt is very helpful to be constantly getting the feedback,\u201d says Murphy, who sees upcoming World Prematurity Day on November 17th as a way to mark the impact prematurity has on society. \u201cThere are very few families, either parents or grandparents, uncles or aunts, who won\u2019t have come across, or had, a baby that was preterm.\u201d Incidence of prematurity has gone up, mainly because multiple births are a big factor and the rate of twinning has increased significantly, due to more widespread use of assisted reproduction. The Economic and Social Research Institute reported a twinning rate of 18.8 per 1,000 maternities for 2016, an increase of 22.1 per cent over the previous decade. At the NMH on November 17th, as at other maternity hospitals, some \u201cpreemies\u201d and their parents are invited in to celebrate what is achieved within the walls of their NICU. But these are not the only cohort of former patients that Murphy is always delighted to see come bouncing back. There are also full-term babies for whom the treatment of therapeutic hypothermia (TH), introduced in Ireland in 2009, has proven to be \u201cone of the most amazing changes\u201d in the prevention of disability resulting from oxygen deprivation during birth. Such babies are at high risk of cerebral palsy. With TH, a cooling jacket is used to lower a baby\u2019s body temperature to 33.5 degrees Celsius, about four degrees lower than normal, within six hours of birth and until it\u2019s 72 hours old. Nobody yet knows precisely how it works, he explains, \u201cbut if we learn more about that, we may be able to use some pharmacological methods as well as this physical method of cooling. It seems to act by slowing down, or cooling, the brain activity \u2013 and that way the brain cells get a chance to recover.\u201d About 70 babies are cooled in Ireland every year, giving good results in the term of outcomes. For every case, antenatal, labour and neonatal data is collected and analysed to help increase knowledge in maternity hospitals about oxygen deprivation and see if and where it might have been preventable. It has been very rewarding to me to see children who obviously have got a problem at birth and then they have been cooled \u2013 and then see them running into you at a clinic \u201cIt has been very rewarding to me to see children who obviously have got a problem at birth and then they have been cooled \u2013 and then see them running into you at a clinic, when I would have seen the opposite. As the cooling has gone on, it\u2019s got better and the equipment has got better. And we have got better at managing it.\u201d Murphy acknowledges the \u201cdichotomy\u201d in keeping preterm babies warm to save life and then cooling some full-term babies to do likewise. \u201cA lot of medicine is counter-intuitive \u2013 it doesn\u2019t work out the way you think it\u2019s going to work out,\u201d he says. Hundreds of trainee paediatricians have benefited from his experience and inspiring passion for the care of the youngest possible members of our population. The training programme set up by the RCPI\u2019s faculty of paediatrics, established in 1992, is, he asserts, \u201csecond to none\u201d. About 40 doctors come into it annually after completing their intern year and do an initial two years. They can progress to higher specialist training, which takes another five years. \u201cThey come out at the end of that with their certificate of full training, which is recognised very well internationally. All our young consultants who have been appointed in recent years have all come through our training system, which is very flattering in a way that all these bright young doctors have chosen to stay in Ireland.\u201d He believes the clinical nature of paediatrics appeals to student doctors. \u201cYou have to work out what\u2019s wrong with the child from observation. It\u2019s not as much about tests, as it is with an adult; tests are painful and difficult to do, so you have to go a lot on your clinical skills.\u201d As for himself, it\u2019s the opportunity to be working with long-term survivors of medical care that he relishes. With a sick, premature baby, there is the satisfaction of setting them up for a lifetime of maybe 80 or 90 years. You may institute intensive care and then a few days into the intensive care sequence, you find the baby has a major complication, say a brain bleed, and then you reconsider He has always found writing up individual cases very stimulating. His father, who used to do a lot of writing advised him that \u201cwriting gives an existence to what you do, gives us some meaning\u201d. In his \u201cspare\u201d time, Murphy has, since 1989, edited the Irish Medical Journal, now published only online, and plays golf. He\u2019s married to a doctor and two of their three adult children have followed in their footsteps, while the third is a solicitor. It\u2019s said that the age of viability for preterm babies is lowered by a week for about every decade of improved neonatal care. Last December, the RCPI recommended 23 weeks\u2019 gestation as the threshold for viability, the previous bar of 24 weeks having been set in 2006. \u201cAnecdotally, we were beginning to resuscitate 23 weeks\u2019 gestation babies so we decided we would lower the limit in recognition of that.\u201d How much lower does Murphy think it can go? \u201cWe haven\u2019t had survivors of 22 weeks, we don\u2019t see that,\u201d he says, while acknowledging that they do in Japan. He reckons it would need another fairly significant innovation before the threshold drops again. Active management of extremely premature babies is ethically complex and when a baby is born at 23 weeks, important conversations have to be held with the parents about the merits and demerits of intensive care. \u201cYou may institute intensive care and then a few days into the intensive care sequence, you find the baby has a major complication, say a brain bleed, and then you reconsider.\u201d There are frank discussions when complications arise, in some \u201cvery challenging human scenarios\u201d. Maybe a couple has been through three or four rounds of IVF before achieving a pregnancy that has resulted in an extremely premature delivery. Constant interaction with colleagues and a sense of camaraderie is what he finds \u201cdestressing\u201d in the job. \u201cWith our team, the junior hospital doctors are teaching every morning and we all go for tea. You\u2019re meeting every day and discussing things every morning, that takes the stress out of situations because you discuss and unburden your concerns and get the best opinions on how to do X, Y and Z. The hospital has that tradition of being a good place to work.\u201d Will he ever retire? \u201cI will eventually,\u201d he smiles. But he\u2019s certainly showing no sign of it yet.\u00a0 Neonatal care by numbers 19 maternity hospitals in the Republic have an average of 164 births a day between them 10 per cent of newborns require admission to a special care unit 7 per cent of babies are born premature, ie before 37 weeks\u2019 gestation 401-1,500g is range for infants classed as \u201cvery low birth weight\u201d 4 tertiary neonatal intensive care units, three in Dublin and one in Cork, look after the country\u2019s sickest babies 2 surgical neonatal units, one in Children\u2019s Health Ireland at Crumlin, the other in Children\u2019s Health Ireland at Temple Street, care for those requiring surgery",

Murphy was \u201csurprised and flattered\u201d to be this year\u2019s recipient of the Kathleen Lynn Medal, awarded by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (RCPI) for \u201cexceptional service on behalf of children\u201d. Nevertheless, in this interview to mark the occasion, he is quick to deflect any reflection of personal achievement and instead welcomes it as \u201cvery good recognition of neonatology, which is not necessarily the most widely known speciality. I think a lot of people don\u2019t know it exists \u2013 until they get a small baby who is sick,\u201d he says, sitting in a boardroom at the top of NMH offices on Mount Street. Neonatology is a speciality in medical and nursing care that only began to emerge in the 1960s. Other professionals, including dietitians, pharmacists, psychologists and clinical engineers who maintain NICUs\u2019 complex equipment, now have vital roles in the field too. Covering the care of all babies from birth until one month of age, he describes neonatology as \u201cthe \u2018human turnstile\u2019 through which everyone passes\u201d, as we adapt to life outside the womb. About 10 per cent of babies require admission to a special care baby unit, although the time spent there may range from hours to several months. The death of baby Patrick Bouvier Kennedy in August 1963, just three months before his father, US president John F Kennedy, was assassinated, kickstarted huge investment into research around prematurity. Jacqueline Kennedy , who missed her husband\u2019s trip to Ireland earlier that summer due to the pregnancy, had to have a Caesarean section to deliver their infant son 5\u00bd weeks early. Suffering from respiratory distress syndrome, he lived only 39 hours, despite access to the best medical care the US could offer at the time. Today, he would be a very routine case in any neonatal unit. Although 7 per cent of babies born in Ireland are premature, defined as less than 37 weeks\u2019 gestation, \u201conly about 1-2 per cent of those are really immature and going to cause all the problems\u201d, says Murphy. Initially, neonatology was all about saving lives but its focus has broadened to trying to minimise lifelong effects of a baby\u2019s early departure from its mothership. The brain is the new frontier in the constant quest for improved neonatal care. \u201cOnce you meet a level of survival and your specialty matures, you begin to look at the quality of survival, that is what you are really after.\u201d Low birthweight, sometimes no more than half a standard bag of sugar, is not the principal problem in itself. Rather, it is the immaturity of their organs. Also, their skin is thin, resulting in a \u201clobster red\u201d appearance and making them liable to rapid loss of heat and water, as well as open to infections. Murphy, described as \u201ca true prince of neonatology and paediatrics in Ireland\u201d in the award citation delivered by Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland -Bahrain vice-president and fellow paediatrician Prof Alf Nicholson , traces his choice of career back to childhood. At home in Cork city he used to watch Dr Finlay\u2019s Casebook, a 1960s TV series about a doctor working in the fictional Scottish town of Tannochbrae. \u201cI saw him one day going into a house and seeing a child who was sick and making a diagnosis of meningitis. Then doing a lumbar puncture and the child got better; I thought, \u2018I\u2019m going to do that\u2019.\u201d He successfully applied to study medicine at University College Cork . During medical training, the sight of a baby with apnoea breathing irregularly, made a big impression on him. There was no treatment for it at the time and it made him think if only there was something that could be done. That was before the administration of caffeine was discovered to be really effective for treating this condition, by improving the contracting of the diaphragm. After several years of further training in the UK, Murphy was the first consultant neonatologist appointed in Wales , before returning to Ireland in 1986 to become one of three at the NMH. Since then, big changes he has worked through include the handling of sensory issues in neonatal care. \u201cThere was a time when people were probably less aware of pain in babies. My rule of thumb is that if I find something painful, the baby is jolly well going to find it painful too.\u201d Loud noises can be very upsetting for these babies who cannot yet filter stimuli. \u201cThe modern intensive care unit is a quiet place. No hoovers are allowed in, the floor must be brushed; phones are put on a light system so less noisy. \u201cThen we have these quiet hours where all the lights go out in the unit and everybody speaks in a whisper and activity goes right down so the babies can rest.\u201d Things that have to be done for a baby, such as taking a blood sample, a swab, changing a nappy, are planned, to reduce the number of disturbances. \u201cIt\u2019s all an attempt to replicate what goes on in the womb, which is really protective, but also to recognise that over-stimulation of these babies may have consequences on their development.\u201d Another simple intervention has been the placement of preterm babies in a plastic bag immediately after birth to keep them warm before transfer to an incubator. They can lose up to 1 degree Celsius a minute and when once, he recalls, theatre and corridor windows were hastily closed in an effort to alleviate heat loss, this \u201cphenomenal technique\u201d now does a very effective job. He\u2019s also seen the introduction of nitric oxide gas for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome and improvements in minimising brain injuries in preterms through the giving of steroids to mothers at risk of premature delivery. Tracking how these babies fare after they are discharged is vital. At the NMH, the neonatal department\u2019s clinical development psychologist Marie Slevin sees all premature babies back at two years of age for what is known as the Bayley assessment, looking at cognitive skills and speech and language development. \u201cIt is very helpful to be constantly getting the feedback,\u201d says Murphy, who sees upcoming World Prematurity Day on November 17th as a way to mark the impact prematurity has on society. \u201cThere are very few families, either parents or grandparents, uncles or aunts, who won\u2019t have come across, or had, a baby that was preterm.\u201d Incidence of prematurity has gone up, mainly because multiple births are a big factor and the rate of twinning has increased significantly, due to more widespread use of assisted reproduction. The Economic and Social Research Institute reported a twinning rate of 18.8 per 1,000 maternities for 2016, an increase of 22.1 per cent over the previous decade. At the NMH on November 17th, as at other maternity hospitals, some \u201cpreemies\u201d and their parents are invited in to celebrate what is achieved within the walls of their NICU. But these are not the only cohort of former patients that Murphy is always delighted to see come bouncing back. There are also full-term babies for whom the treatment of therapeutic hypothermia (TH), introduced in Ireland in 2009, has proven to be \u201cone of the most amazing changes\u201d in the prevention of disability resulting from oxygen deprivation during birth. Such babies are at high risk of cerebral palsy. With TH, a cooling jacket is used to lower a baby\u2019s body temperature to 33.5 degrees Celsius, about four degrees lower than normal, within six hours of birth and until it\u2019s 72 hours old. Nobody yet knows precisely how it works, he explains, \u201cbut if we learn more about that, we may be able to use some pharmacological methods as well as this physical method of cooling. It seems to act by slowing down, or cooling, the brain activity \u2013 and that way the brain cells get a chance to recover.\u201d About 70 babies are cooled in Ireland every year, giving good results in the term of outcomes. For every case, antenatal, labour and neonatal data is collected and analysed to help increase knowledge in maternity hospitals about oxygen deprivation and see if and where it might have been preventable. \u201cIt has been very rewarding to me to see children who obviously have got a problem at birth and then they have been cooled \u2013 and then see them running into you at a clinic, when I would have seen the opposite. As the cooling has gone on, it\u2019s got better and the equipment has got better. And we have got better at managing it.\u201d Murphy acknowledges the \u201cdichotomy\u201d in keeping preterm babies warm to save life and then cooling some full-term babies to do likewise. \u201cA lot of medicine is counter-intuitive \u2013 it doesn\u2019t work out the way you think it\u2019s going to work out,\u201d he says. Hundreds of trainee paediatricians have benefited from his experience and inspiring passion for the care of the youngest possible members of our population. The training programme set up by the RCPI\u2019s faculty of paediatrics, established in 1992, is, he asserts, \u201csecond to none\u201d. About 40 doctors come into it annually after completing their intern year and do an initial two years. They can progress to higher specialist training, which takes another five years. \u201cThey come out at the end of that with their certificate of full training, which is recognised very well internationally. All our young consultants who have been appointed in recent years have all come through our training system, which is very flattering in a way that all these bright young doctors have chosen to stay in Ireland.\u201d He believes the clinical nature of paediatrics appeals to student doctors. \u201cYou have to work out what\u2019s wrong with the child from observation. It\u2019s not as much about tests, as it is with an adult; tests are painful and difficult to do, so you have to go a lot on your clinical skills.\u201d As for himself, it\u2019s the opportunity to be working with long-term survivors of medical care that he relishes. With a sick, premature baby, there is the satisfaction of setting them up for a lifetime of maybe 80 or 90 years. He has always found writing up individual cases very stimulating. His father, who used to do a lot of writing advised him that \u201cwriting gives an existence to what you do, gives us some meaning\u201d. In his \u201cspare\u201d time, Murphy has, since 1989, edited the Irish Medical Journal, now published only online, and plays golf. He\u2019s married to a doctor and two of their three adult children have followed in their footsteps, while the third is a solicitor. It\u2019s said that the age of viability for preterm babies is lowered by a week for about every decade of improved neonatal care. Last December, the RCPI recommended 23 weeks\u2019 gestation as the threshold for viability, the previous bar of 24 weeks having been set in 2006. \u201cAnecdotally, we were beginning to resuscitate 23 weeks\u2019 gestation babies so we decided we would lower the limit in recognition of that.\u201d How much lower does Murphy think it can go? \u201cWe haven\u2019t had survivors of 22 weeks, we don\u2019t see that,\u201d he says, while acknowledging that they do in Japan . He reckons it would need another fairly significant innovation before the threshold drops again. Active management of extremely premature babies is ethically complex and when a baby is born at 23 weeks, important conversations have to be held with the parents about the merits and demerits of intensive care. \u201cYou may institute intensive care and then a few days into the intensive care sequence, you find the baby has a major complication, say a brain bleed, and then you reconsider.\u201d There are frank discussions when complications arise, in some \u201cvery challenging human scenarios\u201d. Maybe a couple has been through three or four rounds of IVF before achieving a pregnancy that has resulted in an extremely premature delivery. Constant interaction with colleagues and a sense of camaraderie is what he finds \u201cdestressing\u201d in the job. \u201cWith our team, the junior hospital doctors are teaching every morning and we all go for tea. You\u2019re meeting every day and discussing things every morning, that takes the stress out of situations because you discuss and unburden your concerns and get the best opinions on how to do X, Y and Z. The hospital has that tradition of being a good place to work.\u201d Will he ever retire? \u201cI will eventually,\u201d he smiles. But he\u2019s certainly showing no sign of it yet.",

Speaking on the Fair Game podcast, Korda remarked of staying on top of her game: \u201cIt\u2019s tough. It honestly has its pros and cons. Everything does in life. I mean, I enjoy it. I love it and inspiring the next generation and I love being out (on tour), that\u2019s what I work for. But, you know, it\u2019s hard too.\u201d Korda has sought to keep her feet firmly on the ground as part of the process of dealing with her status. \u201cPeople get so sucked into, I think, the fame sometimes that they lose themselves. And I think a good thing is you never know what\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019m still 23 and that\u2019s still pretty young for the tour. I just try to enjoy every single moment of this ranking and this experience because, you know, it can be taken away so fast!\u201d Having led the Rolex rankings since winning the KPMG PGA Championship back in June, Korda was displaced at the top following Jin Young Ko\u2019s win in the BMW Ladies which saw the 26-year-old South Korean regain the number one spot in the updated list. The game of yo-yo may go on for some time yet. Bernhard Langer does it again All hail Bernhard Langer . . . . again! As if his 64-year-old body hadn\u2019t already achieved enough, the German\u2019s latest win - in the Dominion Energy Charity Classic on the PGA Champions Tour - brought further distinctions as he became the oldest winner on the seniors circuit (official age being 64 years, one month, 27 days) in what was his 118th win worldwide as a professional and his 42nd on the Champions Tour. \u201cI think it\u2019s just encouraging to everybody that\u2019s over 50 or 60, we can still perform to a very high level and you should never give up. And of course physical conditioning is one thing. You\u2019ve got to be men tally tough, you\u2019ve got to have good technique and nerves and all of the rest of it,\u201d said the evergreen Langer.

By the Numbers 1-60-9-1-6-2-1 - Jin Young Ko\u2019s win in the BMW Ladies Championship (her fourth win of the season on the LPGA Tour) continued an excellent run of form for the South Korean, who has only once finished outside the top-10 in her last seven starts and includes three wins in that hot stretch of form. On this day October 26th 2008 - Cameron Beckman had endured such a miserable season in 2008 that he\u2019d contemplated throwing in the towel on it all.

Beckman - whose previous tour win was in the 2001 Southern Farm Bureau Classic - earned a payday of $900,000 and a two-year exemption to the PGA Tour. \u201cIt\u2019s just been a tough year. I honestly was thinking about quitting the game, that\u2019s how bad I felt. I can\u2019t explain how good I feel right now.

    "content": "Elon Musk\u2019s electric car company Tesla surpassed the 1 trillion dollar market cap on Monday for the first time after Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. Tesla becomes the fifth US company to join the $1 trillion club, after Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. Its stock soared to a new record-high after it crossed $950 during the trading \u2014 up more than 9 per cent. The rally came after the US-based rental car company Hertz on Monday said it has ordered 100,000 Tesla vehicles (worth at least $4.2 billion) by the end of 2022 as part of an ambitious plan to electrify its fleet. The move includes new EV charging infrastructure across the company\u2019s global operations. Beginning in early November, customers will be able to rent a Tesla Model 3 at Hertz airport and neighbourhood locations in US major markets and select cities in Europe. Hertz also is installing thousands of chargers throughout its location network. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will have access to 3,000 Tesla supercharging stations throughout the US and Europe, the company said. Earlier, Tesla hiked prices for all four of its in-production vehicles. The base Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles are each priced $2,000 higher, at $43,990 and $56,990, respectively. In addition, the base Model S and Model X vehicles will each cost $5,000 more, at $94,990 and $104,990, reports electrek.co. Global EV sales skyrocketed 200 per cent in the last year and will likely continue to grow with commitments from global automakers to increase EV sales. For example, in August, three US automakers pledged to boost EV sales to 40-50 per cent by 2030.

    "full_description": "Facebook announced over $9 billion (roughly Rs. 67,550 crore) in quarterly profits, hours after a US news collective published a deluge of withering reports arguing the company prioritises its growth over people's safety. The social media giant has been battling a fresh crisis since former employee Frances Haugen leaked reams of internal studies showing executives knew of their sites' potential for harm, prompting a renewed US push for regulation. Facebook released results showing its profit in the recently-ended quarter grew to $9.2 billion (roughly Rs. 69,040 crore) \u2014 a 17 percent increase \u2014 and its ranks of users increased to 2.91 billion. Facebook executives said on an earnings call that the tech titan would have brought in even more money if not for Apple updating its iPhone operating system to thwart advertisers tracking app users for ad targeting without permission. \"Overall, if it wasn't for Apple's iOS 14 changes, we would have seen positive quarter over quarter revenue growth,\" Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said of the iPhone software tweak made in the name of protecting privacy. Hours earlier, new reports blamed CEO Mark Zuckerberg for his platform bending to state censors in Vietnam, noted Facebook allowed hate speech to flourish internationally due to linguistic shortcomings and said it knew its algorithm fuelled toxic polarisation online. \"These damning documents underscore that Facebook leadership chronically ignored serious internal alarms, choosing to put profits over people,\" US Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Big Tech critic, said in a statement. News organisations like The New York Times, The Washington Post and Wired were among those that have now received access to the set of internal Facebook documents that Haugen originally leaked to US authorities and which were the basis of a damning Wall Street Journal series. Facebook has assailed the reporting as an effort to cast the social network used by billions of people in an inaccurate light. \"Good faith criticism helps us get better, but my view is that what we are seeing is a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company,\" Zuckerberg said in an earnings call. Behind the curtain Haugen, who testified on social media before British lawmakers Monday, has repeatedly said the company puts its continuous growth, and thus profits, before the well-being and safety of users. \"Facebook has been unwilling to accept even little slivers of profit being sacrificed for safety, and that's not acceptable,\" she told the lawmakers, adding that angry or hate-fuelled content \"is the easiest way to grow\" the social media platform. Facebook has been hit by major crises previously, but the current view behind the curtain of the insular company has fuelled a frenzy of scathing reports and a renewed push from US lawmakers to crack down on social media. The Washington Post story out Monday said Zuckerberg had personally signed off on a push from Vietnam's authoritarian government to limit the spread of so-called \"anti-state\" posts. A report from Politico called the documents a \"treasure trove for Washington's anti-trust fight\" against the platform, revealing internal employee chats about Facebook global dominance. One of Monday's reports, from website The Verge , plunged into the company's own worries for its future. \"Teenage users of the Facebook app in the US had declined by 13 percent since 2019 and were projected to drop 45 percent over the next two years, driving an overall decline in daily users in the company's most lucrative ad market,\" the story said, citing internal company research. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

    "full_description": "Draft EU rules to curb the power of Amazon, Apple , Alphabet unit Google and Facebook should also tackle cloud computing services providers over potential anti-competitive practices, a study said on Tuesday. The report coincides with concerns that some EU lawmakers who are reviewing the Digital Markets Act here (DMA) proposed by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager may be lenient towards cloud computing companies. Amazon\u2019s Amazon Web Services was the leading provider in the second quarter of this year, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, market research company Statista found. Others include IBM Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Salesforce and Oracle . https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png The study was prepared by Frederic Jenny, chairman of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s Competition Committee, in his personal capacity for trade body CISPE (Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe). \u201cThe DMA does say that cloud infrastructure can come within the ambit of the DMA but it is not obvious that all the suppliers are covered, for example it doesn\u2019t seem that Google Cloud qualifies under the DMA as a gatekeeper or IBM Cloud or Salesforce,\u201d Jenny told Reuters in an interview. He said potential anti-competitive practices by some companies could include unfair pricing techniques or making it technically difficult for users to move to a rival. Jenny said the study interviewed some 25 companies that use cloud computing services, a number of which cited issues such as unfair licence terms that force customers to pay again to use software they already own when they move to a competitor. Respondents were also concerned about providers bundling software products with their cloud infrastructure to make rival products either less attractive or more expensive. Google, Oracle and SAP declined to comment. Microsoft and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. EU lawmakers have to thrash out the draft DMA with EU countries before it becomes law, possibly in 2023.",

    "full_description": "COMMENT If you got a dollar for every time Scott Morrison said \u2018plan\u2019 today, you\u2019d probably have enough to fill up your car despite record high petrol prices. The Prime Minister revealed Australia\u2019s \u2018plan\u2019 to reach net zero by 2050 ahead of the international climate change conference in Glasgow next week. In fact, the PM said \u2018plan\u2019 at least 80 times during the whole press conference. And that\u2019s without counting how many times he said it in Question Time. Under the plan, more than $20 billion will be invested in \u201clow emissions technologies\u201d, including carbon capture and storage, by 2030. It is expected to generate between $60 billion and $100 billion in \u201cco-investment\u201d. A \u201cnew priority\u201d to deliver \u201cultra-low-cost solar\u201d power is also included in the plan. Time Is Now is part of news.com.au\u2019s partnership with the Monash Climate Change Communication Research Hub, looking at the impacts of climate change across Australia by 2050 Yet despite repeating that word over and over, the main question being asked is how we get there. As the PM was only too willing to repeat today, this was just about releasing the \u2018plan\u2019. When asked when the actual modelling would be released, he did say that yes, it will come \u2018eventually\u2019. \u201cDid you say a moment ago you would release the modelling,\u201d the PM was asked. \u201cEventually, yes,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt is not a plan at any cost,\u201d Mr Morrison said. \u201cThere is no blank cheques here. It will not shut down our coal or gas production or exports. It will not impact households, businesses or the broader economy with new costs or taxes imposed by the initiatives that we are undertaking. \u201cIt will not cost jobs, not in farming, mining or gas because what we are doing in this plan is positive things.\u201d He revealed that emissions are set to be reduced by 30-35 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030 \u2014 an increase from the previous prediction of 26-28 per cent. He also stressed that Australia needed to follow the middle ground of what\u2019s good for the country and what\u2019s good for emissions. \u201cIn this debate there are those who will say we will be ruined if we don\u2019t and we will be ruined if we do. What\u2019s important for Australia is we set that middle course and that\u2019s what my Government\u2019s doing,\u201d he said. He continually stressed the Coalition\u2019s plan to tackle climate change would not involve a tax on carbon emissions like Labor previously introduced. \u201cTechnologies not taxes,\u201d the PM said in a slogan that all Australians will hear many times before the next election. As his plan revealed today, a lot of predicted emissions will be achieved through technology. So much so, that 15 per cent of the planned emission reduction is earmarked for technologies not even invented yet. For now, the PM has revealed a climate plan he hopes will be enough to win him the next election. Mr Morrison was quick to point out that Labor is yet to reveal its climate change policy. \u201cThere is an alternative plan which is not our plan. To be fair, there isn\u2019t, because they haven\u2019t said what it is yet under the Labor Party,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a target without a plan. They have got not even a target for 2030 let alone a plan for 2050.\u201d University of NSW climate scientist Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick said the plan was \u201cpretty ambiguous\u201d. \u201cSure, they\u2019ve said they\u2019ll commit to net zero by 2050, but where are the new policies? There seems to be talk of some investment in greener energy solutions, which is great, but there\u2019s also a focus on current industries being \u2018cleaner\u2019 versions of themselves - how are they going to achieve this?\u201d Backlash to the Coalition\u2019s net zero plan was swift (unsurprisingly) from the Greens and Labor. Greens leader Adam Bandt said the PM would be called a \u201cjoke\u201d by other world leaders at the climate change conference in Glasgow next week. \u201cThis is a climate fraud. There is no new money, no new policies, and more coal and gas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got 2030 targets that will cook our kids and more coal and gas. This so-called climate plan fails to do what is needed to protect the Australian people and our way of life.\u201d And Labor leader Anthony Albanese was just as scathing. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the modelling, and we haven\u2019t had the detail. Because there is net zero modelling, net zero legislation and net zero unity,\u201d he said. It is hypocritical for Labor to complain about a lack of detail, when it hasn\u2019t revealed how it\u2019ll act on climate change yet either. But it does reveal a problem the PM will continue to face. Until Mr Morrison can actually reveal more details and the modelling that will get us to net zero by 2050, he can expect to keep facing tough questions about his \u2018plan\u2019.

    "full_description": "WhatsApp is the world\u2019s most popular messaging service and it is extremely popular in India and Brazil. Apart from chatting, WhatsApp also offers a built-in payments service that is available in both of these countries. WhatsApp Payments service allows users to directly send money to each other. Now, it is being reported that the latest WhatsApp beta version for Android reportedly contains hints that the service might ask users to verify their identity to use payments on the app in the future, according to a new report. According to a report by XDA, WhatsApp for Android version 2.21.22.6 (the latest beta version) has added a few strings that suggest the app might ask users to submit identity verification documents to make payments on the service. However, at this stage, it isn\u2019t clear whether these will be applicable to a specific region as there is no official word from WhatsApp regarding this - it is still under development and could even be removed in a future build. WhatsApp does not ask users for document verification in India or in Brazil at the time of publishing this story - it verifiies Indian users\u2019 phone numbers for the UPI based service. According to the report, WhatsApp uses a different approach in Brazil, asking users to validate their debit or credit cards using Facebook Pay. Meanwhile, on the latest beta, XDA spotted four strings titled \u201cYour identity couldn't be verified. Try uploading the documents again\u201d and another one \u201cVerify your identity to continue using payments on Whatsapp\u201d. There were also two other strings, both titled \u201cWhatsApp Support\u201d that were spotted on the latest beta version of WhatsApp for Android, according to the report. At this point, it is too early to speculate on the reason behind the new strings added to the app, but the report suggests that WhatsApp could be looking to bring the payments service to another region that requires compliance with stricter rules, as Indian and Brazilian users are currently not required to verify their identity, or the verification might be limited for WhatsApp Pay for business purposes. WhatsApp is yet to make any official announcement about this change, and it could be a while before the company does, as it appears to be in development at this time.",

    "full_description": "Facebook employees have warned for years that as the company raced to become a global service it was failing to police abusive content in countries where such speech was likely to cause the most harm, according to interviews with five former employees and internal company documents viewed by Reuters. For over a decade, Facebook has pushed to become the world's dominant online platform. It currently operates in more than 190 countries and boasts more than 2.8 billion monthly users who post content in more than 160 languages. But its efforts to prevent its products from becoming conduits for hate speech, inflammatory rhetoric and misinformation - some which has been blamed for inciting violence - have not kept pace with its global expansion. Internal company documents viewed by Reuters show Facebook has known that it hasn't hired enough workers who possess both the language skills and knowledge of local events needed to identify objectionable posts from users in a number of developing countries. The documents also showed that the artificial intelligence systems Facebook employs to root out such content frequently aren't up to the task, either; and that the company hasn't made it easy for its global users themselves to flag posts that violate the site's rules. Those shortcomings, employees warned in the documents, could limit the company's ability to make good on its promise to block hate speech and other rule-breaking posts in places from Afghanistan to Yemen. In a review posted to Facebook's internal message board last year regarding ways the company identifies abuses on its site, one employee reported \"significant gaps\" in certain countries at risk of real-world violence, especially Myanmar and Ethiopia. The documents are among a cache of disclosures made to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen , a former Facebook product manager who left the company in May. Reuters was among a group of news organisations able to view the documents, which include presentations, reports, and posts shared on the company's internal message board. Their existence was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Facebook spokesperson Mavis Jones said in a statement that the company has native speakers worldwide reviewing content in more than 70 languages, as well as experts in humanitarian and human rights issues. She said these teams are working to stop abuse on Facebook's platform in places where there is a heightened risk of conflict and violence. \"We know these challenges are real and we are proud of the work we've done to date,\" Jones said. Still, the cache of internal Facebook documents offers detailed snapshots of how employees in recent years have sounded alarms about problems with the company's tools - both human and technological - aimed at rooting out or blocking speech that violated its own standards. The material expands upon Reuters' previous reporting on Myanmar and other countries, where the world's largest social network has failed repeatedly to protect users from problems on its own platform and has struggled to monitor content across languages. Among the weaknesses cited were a lack of screening algorithms for languages used in some of the countries Facebook has deemed most \"at-risk\" for potential real-world harm and violence stemming from abuses on its site. The company designates countries \"at-risk\" based on variables including unrest, ethnic violence, the number of users and existing laws, two former staffers told Reuters. The system aims to steer resources to places where abuses on its site could have the most severe impact, the people said. Facebook reviews and prioritises these countries every six months in line with United Nations guidelines aimed at helping companies prevent and remedy human rights abuses in their business operations, spokesperson Jones said. In 2018, United Nations experts investigating a brutal campaign of killings and expulsions against Myanmar's Rohingya Muslim minority said Facebook was widely used to spread hate speech toward them. That prompted the company to increase its staffing in vulnerable countries, a former employee told Reuters. Facebook has said it should have done more to prevent the platform being used to incite offline violence in the country. Ashraf Zeitoon, Facebook's former head of policy for the Middle East and North Africa, who left in 2017, said the company's approach to global growth has been \"colonial,\" focused on monetisation without safety measures. More than 90 percent of Facebook's monthly active users are outside the United States or Canada. Language issues Facebook has long touted the importance of its artificial-intelligence (AI) systems, in combination with human review, as a way of tackling objectionable and dangerous content on its platforms. Machine-learning systems can detect such content with varying levels of accuracy. But languages spoken outside the United States, Canada and Europe have been a stumbling block for Facebook's automated content moderation, the documents provided to the government by Haugen show. The company lacks AI systems to detect abusive posts in a number of languages used on its platform. In 2020, for example, the company did not have screening algorithms known as \"classifiers\" to find misinformation in Burmese, the language of Myanmar, or hate speech in the Ethiopian languages of Oromo or Amharic, a document showed. These gaps can allow abusive posts to proliferate in the countries where Facebook itself has determined the risk of real-world harm is high. Reuters this month found posts in Amharic, one of Ethiopia's most common languages, referring to different ethnic groups as the enemy and issuing them death threats. A nearly year-long conflict in the country between the Ethiopian government and rebel forces in the Tigray region has killed thousands of people and displaced more than 2 million. Facebook spokesperson Jones said the company now has proactive detection technology to detect hate speech in Oromo and Amharic and has hired more people with \"language, country and topic expertise,\" including people who have worked in Myanmar and Ethiopia. In an undated document, which a person familiar with the disclosures said was from 2021, Facebook employees also shared examples of \"fear-mongering, anti-Muslim narratives\" spread on the site in India, including calls to oust the large minority Muslim population there. \"Our lack of Hindi and Bengali classifiers means much of this content is never flagged or actioned,\" the document said. Internal posts and comments by employees this year also noted the lack of classifiers in the Urdu and Pashto languages to screen problematic content posted by users in Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. Jones said Facebook added hate speech classifiers for Hindi in 2018 and Bengali in 2020, and classifiers for violence and incitement in Hindi and Bengali this year. She said Facebook also now has hate speech classifiers in Urdu but not Pashto. Facebook's human review of posts, which is crucial for nuanced problems like hate speech, also has gaps across key languages, the documents show. An undated document laid out how its content moderation operation struggled with Arabic-language dialects of multiple \"at-risk\" countries, leaving it constantly \"playing catch up.\" The document acknowledged that, even within its Arabic-speaking reviewers, \"Yemeni, Libyan, Saudi Arabian (really all Gulf nations) are either missing or have very low representation.\" Facebook's Jones acknowledged that Arabic language content moderation \"presents an enormous set of challenges.\" She said Facebook has made investments in staff over the last two years but recognises \"we still have more work to do.\" Three former Facebook employees who worked for the company's Asia Pacific and Middle East and North Africa offices in the past five years told Reuters they believed content moderation in their regions had not been a priority for Facebook management. These people said leadership did not understand the issues and did not devote enough staff and resources. Facebook's Jones said the California company cracks down on abuse by users outside the United States with the same intensity applied domestically. The company said it uses AI proactively to identify hate speech in more than 50 languages. Facebook said it bases its decisions on where to deploy AI on the size of the market and an assessment of the country's risks. It declined to say in how many countries it did not have functioning hate speech classifiers. Facebook also says it has 15,000 content moderators reviewing material from its global users. \"Adding more language expertise has been a key focus for us,\" Jones said. In the past two years, it has hired people who can review content in Amharic, Oromo, Tigrinya, Somali, and Burmese, the company said, and this year added moderators in 12 new languages, including Haitian Creole. Facebook declined to say whether it requires a minimum number of content moderators for any language offered on the platform. Lost in translation Facebook's users are a powerful resource to identify content that violates the company's standards. The company has built a system for them to do so, but has acknowledged that the process can be time consuming and expensive for users in countries without reliable Internet access. The reporting tool also has had bugs, design flaws and accessibility issues for some languages, according to the documents and digital rights activists who spoke with Reuters. Next Billion Network, a group of tech civic society groups working mostly across Asia, the Middle East and Africa, said in recent years it had repeatedly flagged problems with the reporting system to Facebook management. Those included a technical defect that kept Facebook's content review system from being able to see objectionable text accompanying videos and photos in some posts reported by users. That issue prevented serious violations, such as death threats in the text of these posts, from being properly assessed, the group and a former Facebook employee told Reuters. They said the issue was fixed in 2020. Facebook said it continues to work to improve its reporting systems and takes feedback seriously. Language coverage remains a problem. A Facebook presentation from January, included in the documents, concluded \"there is a huge gap in the Hate Speech reporting process in local languages\" for users in Afghanistan. The recent pullout of US troops there after two decades has ignited an internal power struggle in the country. So-called \"community standards\" - the rules that govern what users can post - are also not available in Afghanistan's main languages of Pashto and Dari, the author of the presentation said. A Reuters review this month found that community standards weren't available in about half the more than 110 languages that Facebook supports with features such as menus and prompts. Facebook said it aims to have these rules available in 59 languages by the end of the year, and in another 20 languages by the end of 2022. \u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2021 .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

    "full_description": "Facebook Inc said on Monday it will start publishing the financial results of its augmented and virtual reality labs as a separate unit, where it is investing billions in its ambitions to build the \u201c metaverse \u201d and as it reported that its main advertising business faces \u201csignificant uncertainty.\u201d Facebook, which reported third-quarter profit up 17%, warned that Apple Inc\u2019s new privacy changes would weigh on its digital business in the current quarter. The social media company reported quarterly revenue below market expectations, which Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told analysts was due to the iOS changes. David Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company expected its investment in its hardware division, Facebook Reality Labs, to reduce overall operating profit in 2021 by approximately $10 billion. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png The financial commitment to this hardware-focused unit which will work on Facebook\u2019s \u201cmetaverse\u201d ambitions, here comes as the company is swamped by coverage of documents leaked by former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen which she said showed the company chose profit over user safety. CEO Mark Zuckerberg started Monday\u2019s analyst call by issuing a defense against criticisms stemming from the documents, which he said painted a \u201cfalse picture of our company.\u201d The CEO has said Facebook in the coming years will be seen not as a social media firm but as a company focused on the metaverse. The buzzy term refers broadly to a shared virtual environment which can be accessed by people using different devices. Facebook, which has invested heavily in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), including buying companies like Oculus, this year created a product team to work on the metaverse. This month, it said it plans to hire 10,000 employees in Europe over the next five years to work on this initiative. \u201cThis is not an investment that is going to be profitable for us any time in the near future,\u201d Zuckerberg told analysts. \u201cBut we basically believe that the metaverse is going to be the successor to the mobile internet.\u201d Wehner said that starting in the fourth quarter of 2021, it would break out Facebook Reality Labs as a separate reporting segment from Facebook\u2019s family of apps. Shares of the company were up about 1% in after-hours trade on Monday. Facebook, whose shares have gained about 20% so far this year, is about $85 billion away from regaining a spot on the $1 trillion club and joining new entrant Tesla Inc. RETOOLING The world\u2019s largest social media network is under scrutiny from global lawmakers and regulators, including from the Federal Trade Commission which has filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging anticompetitive practices. The whistleblower documents, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, have intensified scrutiny of the company. They include internal research and reports about Instagram\u2019s effects on the mental health of teens and about whether Facebook\u2019s platforms stoke divisions, as well as its handling of activity around the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and inconsistencies in the company\u2019s content moderation for users around the globe. For the third quarter, Facebook reported monthly active users of 2.91 billion, up 6% from a year ago but short of analysts\u2019 estimates. On the call, executives emphasized the company\u2019s focus on attracting young adults, including through its short video feature \u201cReels.\u201d \u201cWe are retooling our teams to make serving young adults their North Star rather than optimizing for the larger number of older people,\u201d said Zuckerberg, a shift he said would take \u201cyears, not months, to fully execute.\u201d The leaked documents show Facebook\u2019s ongoing concerns about its appeal to younger users, as rivals like TikTok have enjoyed popularity with teens. They also show the company\u2019s difficulties in dealing with users who create multiple accounts on its platform. Facebook said it expects fourth-quarter revenue to be in a range of $31.5 billion to $34 billion. Analysts had forecast $34.84 billion in revenue, or a 24.1% jump, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Its third-quarter revenue too faced the brunt of Apple\u2019s privacy rules that made it harder for brands to target and measure their ads on Facebook. Sandberg, the COO, said Facebook expects it will solve \u201cmore than half\u201d of the problems that led to the under-reporting by the end of this year. \u201cThe changes to Apple privacy settings have not hurt Facebook in a major way, at least not yet,\u201d said Haris Anwar, an analyst at Investing.com. \u201cThough revenue and user numbers have taken a slight hit over the past quarter, the company\u2019s earning power is still intact.\u201d The company\u2019s total revenue, which primarily consists of ad sales, rose to $29.01 billion in the third quarter from $21.47 billion a year earlier, missing analysts\u2019 estimates of $29.57 billion. Sandberg said Facebook\u2019s advertisers were also affected by the global supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages, which hurt advertising demand across a range of sectors and regions. Facebook said it repurchased $14.37 billion in stock during the third quarter and announced an additional $50 billion in share buybacks.",

    "full_description": "WhatsApp has been steadily getting a slew of updates to make the chatting experience better than ever. Most of these features are reliant on the latest Android and iOS software, and in order to have the same experience for everyone, WhatsApp keep dropping support for older OS as time passes. And as part of this practice, WhatsApp has again dropped support for a few older smartphones. As part of the next move, WhatsApp will now not be supported on Android devices still running on Android 4.0.3. On the iOS side of things, iPhones running on iOS 9 too will not get support. The support will be dropped starting November 1 but users won\u2019t be immediately unable to use the service; it will keep working until the next major WhatsApp update drops. WhatsApp support dropped on these phones Now, Android 4.0.3 was available on a lot of Android devices back in its heydays. Hence, there are a lot of smartphones that will be affected by this move. Some of the popular ones from Samsung include the Galaxy S2, Galaxy S3 Mini, Galaxy Trend 2, Galaxy Trend Lite, Galaxy XCover 2, Galaxy Core, and Galaxy Ace 2. Similarly, a lot of smartphones from the 2011-2013 era will lose support of WhatsApp in the next few weeks. However, the chances of most of you using any of these smartphones is slim, especially in 2021. Hence, you needn\u2019t worry too much about the drop in support. However, if you decided against updating your iPhone 6S since you first started using it in 2015 for some reason, now might be right time to get that iOS 15 update. WhatsApp will drop support for iOS 9 devices but the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are compatible with the latest iOS 15 update. Notably, what people with older Android phones can do to keep running their WhatsApp account is to also try and update their phones' software. However, chances of a fix are slim. Meanwhile, WhatsApp has just released the ability to join video and audio calls in a group even after it has started. If you update to the latest version of WhatsApp, you can now see the group chat notification in your WhatsApp group and you can join in at your convenience. Full list of phones WhatsApp will stop working on: Android Samsung: Galaxy Trend Lite, Galaxy Trend II, Galaxy S2, Galaxy S3 mini, Galaxy Xcover 2, Galaxy Core Galaxy Ace 2 LG: LG Lucid 2, Optimus F7, Optimus F5, Optimus L3 II Dual, Optimus F5, Optimus L5, Optimus L5 II, Optimus L5 Dual, Optimus L3 II, Optimus L7, Optimus L7 II Dual, Optimus L7 II, Optimus F6, Enact, Optimus L4 II Dual, Optimus F3, Optimus L4 II, Optimus L2 II, Optimus Nitro HD and 4X HD, Optimus F3Q ZTE: ZTE Grand S Flex, ZTE V956, Grand X Quad V987 Grand Memo Huawei: Huawei Ascend G740, Ascend Mate, Ascend D Quad XL, Ascend D1 Quad XL, Ascend P1 S Ascend D2 Sony: Sony Xperia Miro, Sony Xperia Neo L Xperia Arc S Others Alcatel One Touch Evo 7, Archos 53 Platinum, HTC Desire 500, Caterpillar Cat B15, Wiko Cink Five, Wiko Darknight, Lenovo A820, UMi X2, Faea F1 THL W8",

    "description": "Ulster Bank is set to shut the doors to new customers for a host of its banking products later this week, as it enters the next stage of its departure from the Irish market. The bank first announced that it would exit the Republic back in February, although it had been signposted some time in advance of this date. Thus far, banking customers haven\u2019t had to do much, unless it was at their own behest. From Friday however, the bank will start pulling back services to new customers, as well as tightening the ones it offers existing customers, as part of its retrenchment. What\u2019s happening at Ulster Bank now? This Friday, October 29th, marks another step in the gradual withdrawal of UK bank Ulster Bank from the Irish market. So far, from a personal banking perspective, Ulster Bank has confirmed that its non-tracker mortgages will transfer to Permanent TSB, alongside 25 of its physical bank branches. AIB is understood to be in discussions with the bank to acquire its \u20ac6.5 billion tracker loan book. Following its announcement in February that it would exit the Republic of Ireland market, the bank stopped serving new business customers during the summer. Now it has extended this to a host of personal banking products. As of close of business on Friday, you won\u2019t be able to open a new savings account, current account, credit card or loan with the Royal Bank of Scotland-owned bank. The bank is keen to stress that \u201ccustomers\u2019 existing products with us are not affected right now\u201d. \u201cWe will notify customers of any changes to them and any action they need to take when necessary,\u201d a spokeswoman says. However, existing customers may now need to give serious thought to switching as the bank continues to wind down its Irish operations. Current accounts From this Friday, however, you will no longer be able to open a current account, even if you are already an Ulster Bank customer; for applications submitted ahead of October 29th, the bank will allow 28 days for the account opening process to be completed. When it comes to direct debits and standing orders on existing accounts, a spokeswoman says that Ulster Bank customers do not need to take any action. \u201cEverything remains in place as normal,\u201d she says. However, Brendan Burgess, founder of askaboutmoney.com, says that the time may have come for current account holders to take action. Noting that the bank has a reported 500,000 current account holders, if another bank doesn\u2019t acquire these en masse \u2013 and technical and regulatory challenges may mean this doesn\u2019t happen \u2013 customers who wait it out may find themselves switching with hundreds of thousands of other customers at the same time. Better perhaps to switch now, and run two accounts concurrently to ensure that all your banking arrangements have transferred satisfactorily before you have to close your Ulster Bank account. \u201cDon\u2019t leave it to the last minute,\u201d says Burgess, \u201cthere could be a flood of people looking to move.\u201d Deposits The bank will also no longer accept deposits from new customers. And there is a slight but important change for existing customers. If, for example, you have money in a fixed-term account, you may need to take action sooner rather than later. According to the bank, deposit accounts that are due to roll over after October 29th will not do so. Rather, \u201cyour balance plus any interest earned will be transferred to your nominated account\u201d. So, get ready to hear from the bank in advance of this date and start thinking about where you\u2019re going to transfer these savings. \u201cCustomers will receive a separate communication about their account prior to the maturity date,\u201d says the spokeswoman. Mortgages The bank will also close its mortgage lending arm to new customers from Friday. But you will still be able to apply for a mortgage with the bank if you are an existing customer, or have loan approval in principle, before this date. Existing customers will also be able to top up their mortgage or extend the term of the loan for the foreseeable. Similarly, mortgages that are in the process of drawdown as of this date will continue to completion. It is expected that the bank\u2019s mortgage book will transfer to Permanent TSB (non-tracker mortgages) and AIB (tracker book), which means that if you go ahead and draw down a mortgage with the bank, it will transfer in time to Permanent TSB (PTSB) \u2013 given that tracker mortgages are no longer an option available to Irish homeowners. Of course a caveat here for those with loan approval is that mortgage approvals are typically valid for six months \u2013 and the bank\u2019s approach may differ over this period given its gradual winding down of business. That may close off the route to you of drawing down the mortgage when you want to do so. The bank says it will give customers with loan approval/approval in principle one chance to reapply after October 19th, but this must be done within 10 days of the loan offer expiring. Friday\u2019s decision is unlikely to lead to any great shift in consumer behaviour however, as the changes have been in train for some time. Mortgage broker Michael Dowling says that Ulster Bank has \u201cnot been considered by brokers or borrowers to any real extent since the announcement was made of their departure\u201d. By signalling last July that they would close to new business from October, it \u201ceffectively ended any new business going their way\u201d, he says. There has been a pick-up in switching of late. On an annual basis, mortgage switches are up by 49 per cent in the year to August 2021, according to figures from the Banking & Payments Federation of Ireland. Depending on what rate you are on now, you may like to consider a switch now, either to another provider, within Ulster Bank itself, or simply have your mortgage transferred to PTSB. While tracker mortgages will retain the benefits of their product, when they transfer to a new owner (most likely AIB), those on fixed or variable rates will face the prospect of the cost of their mortgage increasing. \u201cThe people most hard hit by this will be mortgage customers,\u201d says Burgess, noting that many people will have originally taken out their loan with Ulster Bank as it offered some of the lowest rates and didn\u2019t give a cash back up front. PTSB, on the other hand, does give cashbacks. That in itself can mean higher rates, and its interest rates have anyway not been among the most competitive in the market for some years. It also offers different rates to new and existing customers. You can currently get a two-year fixed rate as low as 2.2 per cent with Ulster Bank for example, but the best rate for an existing customer at PTSB is 2.5 per cent, and this is available only on loans in excess of \u20ac250,000. To counter this, Burgess suggests that those who are currently on a low fixed-term rate with Ulster Bank should wait until the term ends, and then consider switching. Those who may not be able to switch however, for reasons such as reduced income, arrears etc, should now look to fix for as long as possible with Ulster Bank. Loans / credit cards The bank will also close to personal loans, from both new and existing customers. The bank says that for those with an outstanding personal loan, \u201cthere is no change as of yet\u201d. It also means the bank will only accept overdraft requests from existing customers in \u201climited circumstances\u201d, such as short-term emergency fund requirements. Branches Ulster Bank has 88 branches; 25 of these are set to transfer to Permanent TSB, including Shannon in Co Clare, Wilton in Cork, Buncrana in Donegal, Ranelagh, Swords and Blanchardstown in Dublin, and Eyre Square in Galway. It is not yet clear what the future holds for the remaining branches. A spokeswoman for the bank said no Ulster Bank branches will close this year, and \u201cwe do not anticipate closing any branches\u201d in the first six months of 2022. This would then seem to imply that branch closures could be on the way in the second half of next year. What about KBC Bank? Ulster Bank is not the only bank set for a withdrawal from the Irish market; Belgian bank KBC also announced earlier this year that it would exit its operations here. It recently sold most of its non-performing mortgages to US private equity firm CarVal, and has written to all impacted customers to advise them if their loan is included within the sale. A spokeswoman says that \u201cdiscussions with Bank of Ireland are ongoing\u201d. The bank is in talks to sell its \u20ac9 billion of performing loans to its larger Irish rival. In the meantime, it says that it remains open for business, and has not paused applications for current accounts or mortgages. In the event of a transaction being agreed and approved with Bank of Ireland, \u201cKBC will put in place all necessary supports for customers to assist them during the transition\u201d, the spokeswoman says. It\u2019s not necessarily business as usual, however.

    "full_description": "Apple released iOS 15.1 on Monday, the first major software update since it first rolled out iOS 15 in September. The latest update to iOS comes alongside the release of macOS Monterey, the updated operating system for Apple\u2019s Mac lineup. The iOS 15.1 brings a number of new features, including support for SharePlay and ProRes recording feature for the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. How to install iOS 15.1 on your iPhone The best way to download iOS 15.1 is over-the-air, directly on your device. The download has a file size of about 1.4GB. It is recommended to backup up your device before you begin the download. To download the iOS update, go to Settings > General > Software Update. What\u2019s new in iOS 15.1 for iPhone? With iOS 15.1, Apple is finally launching FaceTime\u2019s brand new SharePlay feature. The new SharePlay feature is like co-watching TV shows or listening to music together with friends using screen sharing while on a FaceTime call. Apple describes it as \u201can entirely new way to have shared experiences family and friends in FaceTime.\u201d SharePlay is one of the big headline features Apple added in iOS 15. Also read | Apple\u2019s FaceTime is coming to Android, but there\u2019s a catch Another previously announced feature coming to the iOS is ProRes video for the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. Apple\u2019s ProRes has been one of the most popular codecs in post-production video editing for professionals. ProRes is available all the way up to 4K at 30fps. But if you have the base 128GB storage iPhone 13 Pro or 13 Pro Max, your ProRes footage will be limited to 1080p Full HD definition with 30fps, according to Apple. To enable ProRes, go to Settings> Camera> Formats and enable the Apple ProRes switch. Unfortunately, not all iPhone 13 models will be getting the same level of ProRes support.",

However, the NASA Starlight program points a path forward to send small, relativistic spacecraft far outside our solar system via standoff directed-energy propulsion. These miniaturized spacecraft are capable of robotic exploration but can also transport seeds and organisms, marking a profound change in our ability to both characterize and expand the reach of known life. Here we explore the biological and technological challenges of interstellar space biology, focusing on radiation-tolerant microorganisms capable of cryptobiosis. Additionally, we discuss planetary protection concerns and other ethical considerations of sending life to the stars. Directed Energy Propulsion of a Light Sail. (a) A light sail and payload propelled into interstellar space by directed energy laser propulsion. Emitted photons from a standoff laser array on the surface of the Earth (space-based laser arrays are also possible) impart momentum on the sail by reflection so as to accelerate the spacecraft up to relativistic speeds. Artist's rendition. (b) The laser array is composed of many small, modular sub-elements which can be articulated, switched off, and added so as to enable a large mission space. As the capability of directed energy propulsion grows, relativistic flight will become possible. Stephen Lantin, Sophie Mendell, Ghassan Akkad, Alexander N.

    "full_description": "It was just one slightly bent line in a field of noise. But it wasn\u2019t supposed to be there. What followed next drew Australia\u2019s Parkes radio telescope into an extraterrestrial frenzy. In April 2019, Australia\u2019s CSIRO radio telescope near the town of Parkes in NSW heard something odd. It was watching the nearby star Proxima Centauri . Its purpose was to observe the impact of solar flares on the red dwarf\u2019s small system of planets. But such surveys also offer an opportunity to find signals that are more \u2026 manufactured. And that\u2019s what a review of the observations in 2020 appeared to find. There was good reason to be excited. First, there was the direction it was coming from. Proxima Centauri is too faint to see. But it\u2019s our closest neighbour at just 4.22 light years. And it\u2019s thought to have at least one habitable planet. Second, it was persistent. It was there for several hours. And it wasn\u2019t heard when the 64m-wide telescope looked away every 30 minutes or so. Third, it was narrowband \u2013 a specific 980.002MHz with no spillover \u201cnoise\u201d usually associated with natural events. Fourth, the signal\u2019s frequency \u201cdrifted\u201d slowly, indicating movement through space. Combined, these are a strong set of indicators for a \u201ctechnosignature\u201d \u2013 a non-natural, non-Earth generated radio signal. But, there was a problem. It was never seen again. That didn\u2019t stop the excitement from boiling over. This, after all, was a potential \u201cWow!\u201d signal like the legendary 1977 event. News of the find hit the media last year. First contact At first glance, it was precisely what they were looking for. Russian billionaire Yuri Milner founded the $133 million Breakthrough Listen Initiative project. Its purpose is to scan the skies in the hope of finding traces of extraterrestrial civilisation. The Australian Parkes radio telescope is just one part of the project. Similar devices around the world devote some of their time to the search. The Parkes signal was the initiative\u2019s first real hope of actually having found something. As such, it was named Breakthrough Listen Candidate 1 (BLC-1). The world\u2019s extraterrestrial search community, SETI, turned its eyes towards Proxima Centauri. They were prepared with a variety of equipment to determine everything they could from such a signal. Only such detailed follow-up analysis could confirm that its source was alien, not some kind of unexpected \u201cspoof\u201d (false signal). Nothing more was seen. \u201cIf BLC-1 is never seen to repeat, it will be very difficult to conduct the kind of detailed follow-up that will fully convince scientists that it was a message from aliens,\u201d Breakthrough Listen advisory board member Professor Michael Garrett observed earlier this year. \u201cSceptics will rightly argue that this is more likely to be either a new form of human-generated radio interference or a rare feature of the complex observing instrumentation itself.\u201d Amp overdrive \u201cThe trouble was, we weren\u2019t ready to discuss it,\u201d Curtin University radio astronomer Dr Danny Price says of the media excitement surrounding the signal. \u201cLast year we had only just started secondary verification tests, and there were too many unanswered questions.\u201d Decades of false hopes have given SETI and Breakthrough Listen cause for caution . Moments of immense excitement are almost always followed by a let-down. \u201cWhen you\u2019re searching for signs of extraterrestrial life, you want to be very careful about getting it right before you make any announcements,\u201d Dr Price says. The Breakthrough Listen project scientist says the search team is now finally ready to discuss the Proxima Centauri signal mystery. A Breakthrough Listen SETI ( @BerkeleySETI ) search towards Proxima Centauri has detected a radio signal... but it is very likely to be terrestrial. @SETI_Sheikh and team describe how they verified the signal's origin: https://t.co/RujWapIL0F pic.twitter.com/9csji2DBtV Two studies have been published in Nature Astronomy today. \u201cToday, we are ready to report that BLC-1 is, sadly, not a signal from intelligent life beyond Earth. Rather, it is radio interference that closely mimics the type of signal we\u2019ve been looking for.\u201d The signal, and the circumstances under which it was captured, were exhaustively tested. The conclusion: BLC-1 is most likely interference. Intermodulation, to be exact. \u201cIf you\u2019ve listened to blues or rock guitar, you are probably familiar with intermodulation,\u201d Dr Price says. \u201cWhen a guitar amp is deliberately overdriven (when you turn it up to 11), intermodulation adds a pleasant-sounding distortion to the clean guitar signal. So BLC1 is \u2013 perhaps \u2013 just an unpleasant distortion from a device with an overdriven radio frequency amplifier.\u201d Looking ahead BLC-1 is almost certainly a spoof. It\u2019s an effect that has been seen in radio astronomy before. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to have our hopes of finding other intelligent life out there dashed yet again,\u201d Flinders University space archaeologist and Space Industry Association advisory council member Dr Alice Gorman says. \u201cLonging for company in the vastness of the cosmos is such a strong human impulse. But there are still reasons to be cheerful about the results of this study. Because the team approached the analysis with such rigour, we know that if there is a future signal which suggests a technosignature, we can rely on the evidence. Now we know a little bit more about what not to look for.\u201d But Breakthrough Listen Initiative and SETI remain committed to their search. Their biggest challenge remains verification. Professor Garrett says one way to prevent such \u201cfalse positives\u201d again is to use two widely separated radio telescopes to search in tandem. The odds of the same interference affecting both at the same time are incredibly remote. And that would help sift the wheat from the chaff. \u201cThe human-made interference that has contributed to so many false positives for SETI, and has included orbiting satellites and even microwave ovens, would completely disappear,\u201d he says. But, there\u2019s more. \u201cBy combining their signals using a powerful technique known as Very Long Baseline Interferometry, we can pinpoint the position of a signal with exquisite accuracy, such as to a single star,\u201d he says. \"Regardless of what caused BLC1, it was not the technosignature we were looking for. It did, however, make for an excellent case study, and showed that our detection pipelines are working and picking up unusual signals,\" says Danny. In the case of nearby Proxima Centauri, even a specific planet could be singled out. Doing so, however, isn\u2019t easy. That would require allocating precious time from two radio telescopes. Making it more difficult would be making such an allocation concurrent. Then, the immense amounts of data both telescopes receive will need much greater computing power to combine and sift through. \u201cBut none of these issues are showstoppers, especially as technology continues to advance at unprecedented rates,\u201d Professor Garrett says. Jamie Seidel is a freelance writer | @JamieSeidel Astronomers believe they have found evidence of a planet the size of Saturn in the Whirlpool galaxy after studying data from X-rays. Star Trek actor William Shatner has made a historic visit to space as he described the trip upon his return, saying he hopes he never recovers. NASA is set to launch an Australian-made rover on a mission to the Moon which could be ready for take off as early as 2026.",

David Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company expected its investment in its hardware division, Facebook Reality Labs, to reduce overall operating profit in 2021 by approximately $10 billion. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png The financial commitment to this hardware-focused unit which will work on Facebook\u2019s \u201cmetaverse\u201d ambitions, comes as the company is swamped by coverage of documents leaked by former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen which she said showed the company chose profit over user safety. read more CEO Mark Zuckerberg started Monday\u2019s analyst call by issuing a defense against criticisms stemming from the documents, which he said painted a \u201cfalse picture of our company.\u201d The CEO has said Facebook in the coming years will be seen not as a social media firm but as a company focused on the metaverse. The buzzy term refers broadly to a shared virtual environment which can be accessed by people using different devices. read more Facebook, which has invested heavily in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), including buying companies like Oculus, this year created a product team to work on the metaverse. This month, it said it plans to hire 10,000 employees in Europe over the next five years to work on this initiative. read more \u201cThis is not an investment that is going to be profitable for us any time in the near future,\u201d Zuckerberg told analysts. \u201cBut we basically believe that the metaverse is going to be the successor to the mobile internet.\u201d Wehner said that starting in the fourth quarter of 2021, it would break out Facebook Reality Labs as a separate reporting segment from Facebook\u2019s family of apps. Shares of the company were up about 1% in after-hours trade on Monday. Facebook, whose shares have gained about 20% so far this year, is about $85 billion away from regaining a spot on the $1 trillion club and joining new entrant Tesla Inc. RETOOLING The world\u2019s largest social media network is under scrutiny from global lawmakers and regulators, including from the Federal Trade Commission which has filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging anticompetitive practices. The whistleblower documents, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, have intensified scrutiny of the company. They include internal research and reports about Instagram\u2019s effects on the mental health of teens and about whether Facebook\u2019s platforms stoke divisions, as well as its handling of activity around the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and inconsistencies in the company\u2019s content moderation for users around the globe. read more For the third quarter, Facebook reported monthly active users of 2.91 billion, up 6% from a year ago but short of analysts\u2019 estimates. On the call, executives emphasized the company\u2019s focus on attracting young adults, including through its short video feature \u201cReels.\u201d \u201cWe are retooling our teams to make serving young adults their North Star rather than optimizing for the larger number of older people,\u201d said Zuckerberg, a shift he said would take \u201cyears, not months, to fully execute.\u201d The leaked documents show Facebook\u2019s ongoing concerns about its appeal to younger users, as rivals like TikTok have enjoyed popularity with teens. They also show the company\u2019s difficulties in dealing with users who create multiple accounts on its platform. Facebook said it expects fourth-quarter revenue to be in a range of $31.5 billion to $34 billion. Analysts had forecast $34.84 billion in revenue, or a 24.1% jump, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Its third-quarter revenue too faced the brunt of Apple\u2019s privacy rules that made it harder for brands to target and measure their ads on Facebook. Sandberg, the COO, said Facebook expects it will solve \u201cmore than half\u201d of the problems that led to the under-reporting by the end of this year. \u201cThe changes to Apple privacy settings have not hurt Facebook in a major way, at least not yet,\u201d said Haris Anwar, an analyst at Investing.com. \u201cThough revenue and user numbers have taken a slight hit over the past quarter, the company\u2019s earning power is still intact.\u201d The company\u2019s total revenue, which primarily consists of ad sales, rose to $29.01 billion in the third quarter from $21.47 billion a year earlier, missing analysts\u2019 estimates of $29.57 billion. Sandberg said Facebook\u2019s advertisers were also affected by the global supply-chain disruptions and labour shortages, which hurt advertising demand across a range of sectors and regions. Facebook said it repurchased $14.37 billion in stock during the third quarter and announced an additional $50 billion in share buybacks.",

Founded in 2016 by Cheong Jin Xi, Poladrone now operates in Malaysia and Thailand and plans to expand into Indonesia, the world\u2019s largest oil palm producer.

Its seed round will be used for more hiring and to scale operations and build more Service Centers in agricultural areas, where clients can buy equipment and spare parts. Cheong first became interested in drones when he was a high school student in Melbourne, Australia, and it led to him pursuing an aerospace engineering degree at university. After Cheong returned to Malaysia, he began looking at potential applications for drone technology and realized \u201cthe agriculture industry made perfect sense,\u201d because drones can fly over large terrains to perform repetitive tasks autonomously, and their cameras also capture a large amount of data. Cheong\u2019s interest in agritech was also inspired by growing up in Kuala Lipis, an agricultural town in the state of Pahang. Many of his family members and relatives are involved in farming, and his early insights went into the development of Poladrone\u2019s products. Rhinoceros beetles are a serious problem during the first three years of an oil palm\u2019s 25 year lifecycle, he said, because attacks hurt trees\u2019 growth, delaying them from reaching maturity and sometimes killing plants. \u201cThe issue is that once the surrounding oil palms matures, replanting is no longer possible which means that any space wasted on a dead palm would be wasted for the next 22 years,\u201d Cheong said. As a result, oil palm farms usually need to perform preventative pesticide spraying every two weeks for the first two years after oil palms are planted, then every month until they mature. This is often done by workers with knapsack sprayers or on tractors. One of Poladrone\u2019s Service Centers In 2020, the company launched Oryctes, developed with support from Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation, for precision spot spraying of rhinoceros beetles and other pests. It also recently launched Mist Drone, which blanket sprays open field crops, like paddies, corn and bananas. Most of the oil palm farms Poladrone works with are mid-to-large size, or about 5,000 hectares and above. \u201cData analytics and automation becomes extremely important for farms once they reach this scale,\u201d Cheong said. He added that oil palm farms cover 18.7 million hectares around the world, and Poladrone sees a serviceable addressable market of 4.2 million hectares in Malaysia alone, worth over $1.3 billion per year. The company is also planning to expand its reach to other types of crops, like rice, corn and sugarcane. In addition to selling its products, Poladrone\u2019s Service Centers also provide repairs, training and workshops, with the goal of increasing drone adoption.

    "full_description": "Just a few days before SpaceX launches four more astronauts to space, NASA has released a trailer highlighting the mission. You can watch it below: The Crew-3 astronauts heading to the International Space Station (ISS) on Sunday, October 31, are NASA\u2019s Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn, and Kayla Barron, along with Matthias Maurer from the European Space Agency. They\u2019ll launch aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft atop a Falcon 9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The mission marks the fourth crewed launch using SpaceX hardware, following the first Crew Dragon astronaut flight in the summer of 2020. In the trailer, Kathy Leuders, associate administrator of space operations at NASA, said: \u201cThe crew going up are going to be doing even more science and pushing the bounds of technology.\u201d The four astronauts will live and work aboard the orbiting laboratory for about six months, carrying out science experiments in microgravity conditions and performing spacewalks to continue work upgrading the station\u2019s power supply. There may even be time for a dinner party or two . During their time in space, the Crew-3 astronauts will welcome two different private crews to the ISS, including Japanese tourists aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft at the end of this year, and Axiom\u2019s Ax-1 mission sending the first private crew to the ISS in early 2022. Marshburn is the only Crew-3 member who has been to space before. In fact, this will be his third mission to the ISS aboard his third vehicle, with the space veteran previously traveling aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour and a Russian Soyuz spacecraft. Chari has flown with the U.S. Air Force and participated in combat missions in Iraq, while Barron graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy with a bachelor\u2019s degree in systems engineering. She is a qualified submarine warfare officer. Germany-born Maurer has picked up a number of national awards for outstanding research in the field of materials sciences, and five years ago spent just over two weeks underwater as part of efforts to test exploration techniques and tools for future Mars missions. While preparing for his first space mission, Maurer earlier this year gave space fans an exclusive peek at preparations for his upcoming space station stay, and also showed off an important new skill that astronauts are required to learn before heading there.

    "description": "The Sony Xperia Pro-I is an on-the-go videographer\u2019s dream phone with fast specs, custom video software, and a 1-inch light sensor for low-light recording.",
    "content": "<article> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/sony-xperia-pro-is-a-5g-uploading-second-screen-for-professional-content-streamers\">Sony Xperia Pro</a> was released in January as a device for video professionals, and now a new version \u2013 the Sony Xperia Pro-I \u2013 has been announced as a phone that's custom-made for vloggers. The phone will be available for preorder starting October 28 and will be sold unlocked starting in December 2021 in the US, though availability in other regions hasn't been announced. </p><p>The Xperia Pro-I (\u2018I\u2019 for imaging) has nearly all the perks of its predecessor and a few improvements of its own at a lower price \u2013 $1,799 / \u00a31,599 (around AU$2,400), compared to the staggering $2,500 (around \u00a31,830 / AU$3,245) price tag of the Xperia Pro. The new Pro-I doesn\u2019t have the HDMI port central to the Xperia Pro\u2019s use as an external display for expensive professional cameras, so it\u2019s more a general use phone built for videographers. </p><p>The Xperia Pro-I does have an improved main camera with a 1-inch sensor. It\u2019s one of the first mainstream phones to have a sensor of that size (and the first coming to the US), which enables better low-light performance, dynamic range, and more natural depth-of-field compared to the computational bokeh seen in phones with smaller sensors. The main camera's dual aperture lens, which lets you switch between f/2.0 and f/4.0, gives you added control over this background blur.</p><p>The megapixel count hasn\u2019t changed from the Pro \u2013 all three rear cameras are 12MP, so the main, telephoto, and ultra-wide cameras aren\u2019t improved in that regard. But the Xperia Pro-I has other improvements on the standard Pro, like having 315 points of autofocus (the green grid of boxes shown when taking photos) covering 90% of the viewfinder, compared to 247 points on the Xperia Pro covering 70% of the viewfinder. The phone can also take burst shots up to 20 frames per second with autofocus, as well as improved anti-distortion over earlier Xperia models.</p><p>Other than its rearranged rear camera block, the Xperia Pro-I is physically similar to the Xperia Pro, though it does bump the chipset up to the Snapdragon 888 found in this year\u2019s flagship Android phones. It has the same 6.5-inch OLED display as the Xperia 1 III, though that should be fine for most smartphone owners \u2013 its 4K resolution (3840 x 1644) is rare among modern smartphones. </p><p>It packs a 4,500mAh battery and 30W charger, as well as the Xperia I III\u2019s front-facing speakers as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack. It has a shortcut button that can be set to open any app, and the dedicated shutter button has the same shutter switch module as Sony's RX100 series compact cameras. There\u2019s even a little hole to secure a wrist strap.</p><p>And, crucially, the Xperia Pro-I can record video \u2013 which the Xperia Pro couldn\u2019t. But there\u2019s more for the modern vlogger that Sony\u2019s new phone can offer.</p> <h2 id=\"xperia-pro-i-what-x2019-s-here-for-video-fans-5\">Xperia Pro-I: what\u2019s here for video fans?</h2> <figure data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2000px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\"><img id=\"CaCPCTNELGnDtn6TXGQRRd\" name=\"SonyXperiaPro-I-2.jpg\" alt=\"The Sony Xperia Pro-I phone with its Vlog Monitor accessory on a blue background\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CaCPCTNELGnDtn6TXGQRRd.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" ><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The Xperia Pro-I is dedicated to video recording, with some firsts in the world of smartphones: it\u2019s the first to natively record 120fps \u2013 and saving every frame, unlike other phones that record at that speed, but save in 30 or 24fps to play back in slow motion at a specific speed. Saving every frame means users can choose whatever slow-mo rate they want.</p><p>There\u2019s also new software, Video Pro, which offers a similar level of manual control and editing as Sony\u2019s Cinema Pro app that came with the Xperia Pro. The phone\u2019s wide 21:9 screen enables the phone to show the viewfinder in 16:9 with enough room on the side for manual video controls. With software called Optical Steadyshot and StableEye that stabilizes the footage and tracks moving subjects, the phone promises a lot for action videographers.</p><p>There\u2019s also an optional $199 / \u00a3169 (around AU$265) Vlogging accessory \u2013 a 3.5-inch external display that can magnetically mount on the back of the Xperia Pro-I to show what\u2019s recording from the rear cameras. And for those who want to protect their phone in style, a $90 (around \u00a365 / AU$120) leather case.</p> <hr> <h2 id=\"analysis-a-significant-moment-for-camera-phones-xa0-5\">Analysis: A significant moment for camera phones </h2> <figure data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3000px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\"><img id=\"gGJp2X6CwPdZdosevo9u9i\" name=\"SonyXperiaPro-I-3.jpg\" alt=\"The Sony Xperia Pro-I phone sitting next to a Sony camera.\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gGJp2X6CwPdZdosevo9u9i.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3000\" height=\"1687\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" ><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The Sony Xperia Pro-I has a few 'world first' claims, but perhaps the most significant is that Sony has officially called it a part of its camera lineup.

    "full_description": "The Sony Xperia Pro was released in January as a device for video professionals, and now a new version \u2013 the Sony Xperia Pro-I \u2013 has been announced as a phone that's custom-made for vloggers. The phone will be available for preorder starting October 28 and will be sold unlocked starting in December 2021 in the US, though availability in other regions hasn't been announced. The Xperia Pro-I (\u2018I\u2019 for imaging) has nearly all the perks of its predecessor and a few improvements of its own at a lower price \u2013 $1,799 / \u00a31,599 (around AU$2,400), compared to the staggering $2,500 (around \u00a31,830 / AU$3,245) price tag of the Xperia Pro. The new Pro-I doesn\u2019t have the HDMI port central to the Xperia Pro\u2019s use as an external display for expensive professional cameras, so it\u2019s more a general use phone built for videographers. The Xperia Pro-I does have an improved main camera with a 1-inch sensor. It\u2019s one of the first mainstream phones to have a sensor of that size (and the first coming to the US), which enables better low-light performance, dynamic range, and more natural depth-of-field compared to the computational bokeh seen in phones with smaller sensors. The main camera's dual aperture lens, which lets you switch between f/2.0 and f/4.0, gives you added control over this background blur. The megapixel count hasn\u2019t changed from the Pro \u2013 all three rear cameras are 12MP, so the main, telephoto, and ultra-wide cameras aren\u2019t improved in that regard. But the Xperia Pro-I has other improvements on the standard Pro, like having 315 points of autofocus (the green grid of boxes shown when taking photos) covering 90% of the viewfinder, compared to 247 points on the Xperia Pro covering 70% of the viewfinder. The phone can also take burst shots up to 20 frames per second with autofocus, as well as improved anti-distortion over earlier Xperia models. Other than its rearranged rear camera block, the Xperia Pro-I is physically similar to the Xperia Pro, though it does bump the chipset up to the Snapdragon 888 found in this year\u2019s flagship Android phones. It has the same 6.5-inch OLED display as the Xperia 1 III, though that should be fine for most smartphone owners \u2013 its 4K resolution (3840 x 1644) is rare among modern smartphones. It packs a 4,500mAh battery and 30W charger, as well as the Xperia I III\u2019s front-facing speakers as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack. It has a shortcut button that can be set to open any app, and the dedicated shutter button has the same shutter switch module as Sony's RX100 series compact cameras. There\u2019s even a little hole to secure a wrist strap. And, crucially, the Xperia Pro-I can record video \u2013 which the Xperia Pro couldn\u2019t. But there\u2019s more for the modern vlogger that Sony\u2019s new phone can offer. The Xperia Pro-I is dedicated to video recording, with some firsts in the world of smartphones: it\u2019s the first to natively record 120fps \u2013 and saving every frame, unlike other phones that record at that speed, but save in 30 or 24fps to play back in slow motion at a specific speed. Saving every frame means users can choose whatever slow-mo rate they want. There\u2019s also new software, Video Pro, which offers a similar level of manual control and editing as Sony\u2019s Cinema Pro app that came with the Xperia Pro. The phone\u2019s wide 21:9 screen enables the phone to show the viewfinder in 16:9 with enough room on the side for manual video controls. With software called Optical Steadyshot and StableEye that stabilizes the footage and tracks moving subjects, the phone promises a lot for action videographers. There\u2019s also an optional $199 / \u00a3169 (around AU$265) Vlogging accessory \u2013 a 3.5-inch external display that can magnetically mount on the back of the Xperia Pro-I to show what\u2019s recording from the rear cameras. And for those who want to protect their phone in style, a $90 (around \u00a365 / AU$120) leather case. The Sony Xperia Pro-I has a few 'world first' claims, but perhaps the most significant is that Sony has officially called it a part of its camera lineup. Considering that lineup contains some of the world's best cameras , it's a symbolic moment for camera phones \u2013 and for premium compact cameras, too. That's because the Xperia Pro-I is effectively the phone equivalent of the Sony ZV-1 and Sony RX100 VII . Those two compact cameras are built on a similar 1-inch sensor and Bionz X processors. Until now, they've also held an advantage over the Xperia range (and most other smartphones) when it comes to sensor size and professional features. The Xperia Pro-I sees Sony effectively abandon any concerns about cannibalization in favor of making a smartphone that can compete, on paper, with its best compact cameras for stills and video. It also sees Sony tread a very different path to its big camera phone rivals like Apple, Google and Samsung. While the latter are now largely focused on computational point-and-shoot photography, the Xperia Pro-I is a pro-focused camera that's built on Sony's more traditional advantages in sensors, lenses and real-time tracking autofocus. Traditional cameras, like the Sony RX100 series, do still hold some advantages in areas like lenses. Despite the Xperia Pro-I's inclusion of a glass Zeiss Tessar lens, size constraints do still limit what's possible in a smartphone \u2013 so we'll have to see how that plays out in some real-world tests. But there's no doubt that the Xperia Pro-I is a bold statement of intent from Sony, which is the only smartphone maker that also makes world-class standalone cameras. The question is how many people, other than Sony camera fans, want that type of experience in a phone, compared to the more beginner-friendly smarts of the best camera phones .",

    "description": "The Health Service Executive is making fresh efforts to find out why people are not coming forward for Covid-19 vaccination as part of a wider campaign to push more people to take the jab. In an attempt to encourage more of the 360,000 people still to be fully vaccinated, the HSE said it would contact people individually who have registered but not taken their first dose or availed of their second to \u201cunderstand if there are any barriers preventing them from getting the vaccine\u201d. The contacts are part of a campaign over the next week targeting border counties and parts of Dublin and the midlands where vaccine take-up is lower. It will also focus on younger people, pregnant women, the medically vulnerable and ethnic groups who are hesitant about the vaccine. There are an estimated 300,000 people who have not been vaccinated and a further 60,000 people who have had their first dose but have not yet come forward for a second dose. Adverse reaction The efforts to encourage further vaccinations come against the backdrop of a very high vaccination uptake amounting to more than 90 per cent of the adult population. The HSE said some people on its system may have been prevented from availing of their first or second doses because they travelled or moved abroad, died after registering or caught Covid-19 between doses or had an adverse reaction to their first dose and chose not to get the second. State regulator, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, said that as of September 28th, it had received 15,424 reports of suspected side-effects out of 7.2 million doses then administered. Damien McCallion, HSE national director of the Covid vaccination programme, said that the number of people who had declined the second dose because of an adverse reaction to the first was \u201cvery small\u201d. Booster shots He said that the HSE had a protocol for referring people for assessment on whether they should take the second dose in cases where people experienced an adverse reaction to the first. A HSE spokeswoman said that someone who experienced an adverse reaction to one vaccine could be given one of the other three vaccines available for a second dose. Meanwhile, the European Union\u2019s drug regulator on Monday said it had concluded in its review that Moderna\u2019s Covid-19 booster vaccine may be given to people aged 18 years and above, at least six months after the second dose. It is the second Covid-19 booster vaccine to be approved in the EU. Earlier this month, the European Medicines Agency approved Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s booster and recommended a third dose of a shot from either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna for people with weakened immune systems. It left EU member states to decide if the wider population should receive a booster.",

    "full_description": "Even as banks have deployed the latest tech to keep bank account holders' money safe, they are still sending a warning to customers about how to protect their bank accounts. Bank account holders have been found to fall victim to cybercriminals who steal their money after getting access to their usernames, passwords, PIN and other secret information. Bank account holders can keep themselves safe simply by not entertaining any strangers' requests. The idea is never to trust anyone on the phone, email, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter etc., who ask account holders to click on some links or download any app. If users do not protect their secret data from strangers, they will lose their money. It is is simple. Here is how to protect your money online account: Beware of Fraud Calls and Remote Desktop Apps The AnyDesk app is something that fraudsters use frequently to gain access to your bank account details and carry out fraudulent transactions. There is nothing wrong with the app, except that cybercriminals use it to gain access to users' computers. Step by step process the criminals use - modus operandi 1. The fraudster may call you to complete a KYC/Transfer of funds 2. They may request you to click on any link or download remote desktop apps like Anydesk/Team Viewer 3. They May then ask you to share Anydesk 9 digit code, which will provide the fraudster access to your device 4. Since device access is compromised, they can see your device PIN, pattern, MPIN & can carry out unauthorised transactions 5. Be aware there can be other applications of similar nature & same modus operandi. Do not share the following details: I. Debit card details include CVV, ATM, PIN II. OTP & mPIN III. Mobile application activation message \u2022 Do not download any Third-party remote desktop applications like (Anydesk / Quick Support) \u2022 To report any fraud or to block your Debit and Credit Card, you can call your bank's customer service number or send a 'Hi' on their WhatsApp number. Most banks have a WhatsApp account now to serve account holders.",

    "full_description": "Australian motorists have admitted to dangerous behaviour behind the wheel, including \u201cbrake-testing\u201d cars that are tailgating, in a new survey of driver behaviour. Research released by dashcam manufacturer Nextbase shows more than half of Aussie motorists believe they don\u2019t have bad driving habits, despite many admitting to speeding, road rage and using their phone while driving. Of more than 2000 people surveyed, almost one in four admitted to speeding on public roads. More than one in three said they slowed down when being tailgated, with 13 per cent braking suddenly when annoyed by trailing drivers. Only one in five drivers said they had not experienced road rage. More than half of drivers surveyed said they are safer behind the wheel with kids in the car, while others said they took extra care when carrying fragile goods or during police double demerit periods. Some 27 per cent reported they were annoyed by cyclists on the road, with women were more likely than men to feel nervous when driving near a cyclist. Nextbase claims one in four drivers responding to its survey have a dashcam in their primary vehicle, and that 45 per cent of drivers say dashcams should be standard in new cars. Richard Browning, managing director of Nextbase, said \u201cyou should always drive as if you\u2019re being filmed\u201d, and that \u201c26 per cent of Australians say that they would change their driving behaviour when they know a dashcam is recording them\u201d. A fresh alternative to established manufacturers is on the way, promising to undercut household names with an innovative approach. Choosing a new ride isn\u2019t easy, particularly if you\u2019re taller - or smaller - than average. But there are great options that are worth a closer look.

    "full_description": "Forecasters have warned of a \u201cwild change\u201d to the weather in the country\u2019s south and east as the week progresses. Sydney and Brisbane could see temperatures of up to 35C. At the same time Melbourne could get a drenching and snow could descend on higher ground in Victoria and Tasmania. \u201cThere is plenty going on in the weather this week,\u201d said Sky News Weather meteorologist Rob Sharpe who also warned there could be \u201chundreds of thousands of lightning strikes\u201d over the coming days due to powerful winds and a litany of low-pressure systems. Initially, however, it\u2019s going to be Queensland and Western Australia where the action is. A supercell thunderstorm is a possibility in the Wide Bay-Burnett region of Queensland and up in to central parts of the state on Tuesday. These fierce storms can bring strong winds, heavy rain and large hail. However, conditions should calm down considerably from Wednesday onwards. Brisbane is looking at 27C and some rain on Wednesday with the mercury gradually rising to a high of 35C on Saturday which could coincide with some showers. Nights will be warm with temperatures getting down to around the 20C mark. Northern parts of Queensland should be settled with 33C highs in Townsville and some showers on Sunday. Perth could also see storms on Tuesday with up to 10mm of rain and then another 15mm on Wednesday as the low-pressure system rolls in across the coast. It will be clearer later in the week however with highs of 20C climbing to 25C on the weekend and chilly lows which could go down to just 7C early on Thursday. Low-pressure system begins to build This low-pressure system is then set to bring tumultuous conditions for the country\u2019s south and east, according to Mr Sharpe. \u201cAs that low heads further east, it helps to push the heat across into NSW for Thursday and Friday and it will aid the development of a new low over southern mainland Australia,\u201d he said. Before it does that, the system will lead to elevated fire dangers across much of South Australia including areas around Adelaide, particularly on Wednesday. A total fire ban is in place for the eastern Eyre Peninsula including Whyalla. Adelaide is looking at 30C for Tuesday and Wednesday, but as that low passes, the temperatures will drop to 27C on Thursday and then a steep fall to 17-18C heading in to the weekend. There could be some showers from Wednesday onwards. Snow, rain for Victoria and Tasmania A new low, fuelled by that system from Western Australia, will strengthen overland before crossing Bass Strait to Tasmania on Friday. \u201cIt brings the threat of damaging winds to Victoria and Tasmania along with a burst of heavy rainfall, cold temperatures and highland snow,\u201d Mr Sharpe said. A mild 19C in Melbourne on Tuesday will rise to 26C on a sunny and dry Wednesday. But then it could get soggy in the city with up to 10mm on Thursday, with a high of 22C, and 15mm on Friday. Temperature-wise, it may only hit 15C on Saturday with a low of 8C early on Sunday in Melbourne. It\u2019s pretty much the same conditions across the state with wet weather from Thursday onwards and into the weekend. Ahead of the low, it will also get warmer in Tasmania with Hobart reaching 23C on Wednesday. But come Friday and 12C will be as high as it gets with lows of 8C as the systems takes hold. Hobart could see up to about 25mm of rain between Thursday and Saturday. Snow on Kunanyi/Mount Wellington may descend on Friday and Saturday as temperatures drop to -2C. Reaching 35C on the east coast Just as it gets chiller over the south it will be warming up in NSW with westerlies sucking the hot conditions north up the coast without the cooling effect of a sea breeze. \u201cThis means that Sydney city will be just as hot as western Sydney with the temperature set to reach between 32 and 35C across the basin,\u201d Mr Sharpe said. Those highs are likely to be reached around Thursday and Friday with storms a possibility. Either side of that spike \u2013 mid-twenties highs and lows in the mid-teens \u2013 will be more the order of the day in the Harbour City. Canberra will also see a rise in temperatures but not quite to Sydney levels. Wednesday\u2019s 24C peak will get to 27C on Thursday and then down to 24C on Friday and just 17C on the weekend. A chilly low of 6C on Wednesday morning. \u2018Hundreds of thousands\u2019 of lightning strikes \u201cThe presence of these low-pressure systems in southern Australia and the Great Australian Bight will create a dangerous thunderstorm environment to the north of them because the winds through the atmosphere will be powerful,\u201d Mr Sharpe told news.com.au. \u201cThe combination of hot weather at the surface and powerful cold winds in the upper levels of the atmosphere will create fast-moving and dangerous storms. \u201cThey will produce hundreds of thousands of lightning strikes in South Australia, Victoria and NSW between Wednesday and Friday. Many storms will be severe with damaging wind gusts,\u201d he said. Stormy in the Top End too from Wednesday onwards. Temperatures will top out at 35C most days with lows of 24C and a smattering of rain in Darwin. When Scott Morrison fronted cameras to reveal a major policy he said this word 80 times. But he is already facing some tough questions. Scott Morrison revealed his much-anticipated climate change plan today, but was promptly grilled on some missing details. A seven-metre high wall erected to protect beachside mansions from being washed away has sparked debate in a Sydney suburb.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Jen-Hsun (Jensen) Huang, CEO of Nvidia Corp., gives a keynote presentation during the GPU Technology ... [+] Conference. (Photo by Kim Kulish/Corbis via Getty Images) Corbis via Getty Images Diversity and inclusion strategies remain a hot topic in board rooms across the globe. Over the past several years, technology companies have been heavily criticized for the low representation of women and minorities in technical and leadership roles. Many of these companies have since created hiring metrics and programs to recruit new talent. However, this isn\u2019t a problem that can be fixed overnight. While women comprise nearly half the workforce, they hold only 28% of the jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), according to the National Girls Collaborative Project. To change these figures, women must want to work in STEM and they need the educational background to perform the work. New foundations and programs such as Girls Who Code , Women in STEM and Latinas in STEM create an environment where young girls and women are encouraged to enter STEM fields. These organizations provide a vital sense of community, mentorship and advocacy. Signing on for a college program is one way to move into the AI field, but there are numerous educational paths to gain practical skills, from online courses to in-person events. Technology conferences play a crucial role in attracting and educating a diverse population about opportunities in emerging careers such as artificial intelligence. While AI is considered a largely male-dominated field, NVIDIA\u2019s continues to drive its push for supporting women in STEM in its conferences and networking events. NVIDIA's GTC highlights role models across gender, ethnicity and geographies. For example, GTC will feature sessions focused on business and technical topics in Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. Speakers from organizations and universities, such as the Kenya AI Center of Excellence, Ethiopian Motion Design and Visual Effects Community, Python Ghana, Nairobi Women in Machine Learning & Data Science, and Chile Inria Research Center, will describe how emerging market developers are using AI to address challenges. Other speakers include Anima Anandkumar, the director of machine learning research at NVIDIA; Fei-Fei Li, professor of computer science at Stanford University; and Cristina Vasconcelos, a Research Software Engineer at Google. It's good to see NVIDIA showcasing a wide range of talent from across the globe. Why does it matter? It's essential for women, people of color, and various ages to have role models that highlight the opportunities available to anyone willing to learn new skills. Many technology vendors offer free or low-cost access to technology and online courses. To create a balanced ethical culture, diversity and inclusion efforts must be executed in a way that promotes meritocracy and opportunities for learning and advancement.

In addition to hiring diverse talent, organizations should evaluate how to cultivate talent from within the firm by leveraging the latest online educational tools. Also, supporting a hybrid and flexible work policy will enable companies to attract and retain talent.

    "full_description": "Astronomers have found evidence of a possible planet in the M51 (\u201cWhirlpool\u201d) galaxy. If confirmed, it will be the first time a planet has been detected outside the Milky Way. The discovery of the exoplanet was made using NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory. The planet in M51 is about 28 million light-years away. That means it would take a space ship - travelling at the fastest speed possible in the universe - 28 million years to reach the planet. Exoplanets are normally discovered by watching for small dips in light as the planets pass in front of their star - as viewed from Earth. It\u2019s thought the planet is about the size of Saturn and is orbiting a neutron star or black hole about 20 times the mass of the Sun. The material near the neutron star or black hole has become superheated and glows in X-rays - which the team used to their advantage. Because the region producing bright X-rays is small, a planet passing in front blocks most or all of the X-rays, making the transit easier to spot because the X-rays disappear. The X-ray transit found by the team lasted about three hours, during which the X-ray emission decreased to zero. Based on this and other information, the researchers estimate the exoplanet candidate in M51-ULS-1 would be roughly the size of Saturn and orbits the binary system at about twice the distance of Saturn from the Sun. The large orbit means the planet won\u2019t pass in front of the system again for about 70 years. Rosanne Di Stefano from the Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge led the study, published today in Nature Astronomy. \u201cWe are trying to open up a whole new arena for finding other worlds by searching for planet candidates at X-ray wavelengths, a strategy that makes it possible to discover them in other galaxies,\u201d Dr Di Stefano said. Could it just be dust? There is a possibility that the dimming could have been caused by a cloud of gas and dust passing in front of the X-ray source. However, the researchers consider this to be an unlikely explanation, as the characteristics of the event observed in M51-ULS-1 are not consistent with the passage of such a cloud. The model of a planet candidate is, however, consistent with the data. To join the conversation, please log in. Don't have an account?

    "full_description": "Google\u2019s Pixel smartphones have always leant on AI tricks to overcome hardware weaknesses, utilising complex algorithms and cloud processing rather than raw power. But this year, with the Pixel 6, the company\u2019s built a device with brains and brawn. With all new camera hardware, a custom processor for more capable on-device (rather than cloud-based) AI capabilities and a fun, confident aesthetic in both build and software, these machines measure up to Apple\u2019s 2021 iPhones in almost every way while coming in significantly cheaper. The Pixel 6 Pro (left) and standard Pixel 6 are practically the same size, but the former packs a much larger display. The standard Pixel 6 is bigger, prettier, more powerful and has far superior cameras compared to last year\u2019s Pixel 5, but sticks to the same price of $999. It also has a bigger, smoother display than the equivalent iPhone 13, takes nicer pictures in many scenarios and comes in at $350 less. I really like the Pixel 6\u2019s unusual glossy two-tone body, broken up by a chunky horizontal camera bar. It has a completely flat 6.1-inch display and a satiny frame that looks great with Google\u2019s new botanical wallpaper themes. Meanwhile the $1299 Pixel 6 Pro (which is $400 or $550 less than the iPhone depending on whether you compare it to the 13 Pro or 13 Pro Max), is essentially the same physical size as the regular Pixel 6, but with smaller bezels and a curved design that allows for a bigger 6.7-inch display. It looks a bit ritzier, but maybe not quite as fun, with a thin polished metal frame. Both phones are powered by Google\u2019s own Tensor processor, have beautiful AMOLED screens with fast refresh rates (90Hz on Pixel 6 and up to 120Hz on the Pro), IP68 waterproofing, 30W fast charging and 128GB of storage. They have enough grunt to handle any game or app I threw at them, excellent (but not industry-leading) battery life, and they also both support 5G, with the Pro being the first Australian phone to support the mmWave variety (not that it\u2019ll be much good to you right now). Photography has always been a strength of Google\u2019s phones, but refreshed hardware means they\u2019re once again at the very top at the pile with Pixel 6. There\u2019s a new 50MP main shooter with a large sensor, plus a 12MP ultrawide, with the Pro adding a periscope telephoto at 3x optical zoom. Shots are always sharp and well exposed, low light photos and selective blur for portraits are both the best you can get anywhere, and video \u2014 which was previously a weak spot \u2014 is slick, stable and perfectly clear at Full HD or 4K. New on the Pixel 6 are motion photo modes \u201caction pan\u201d and \u201clong exposure\u201d, which will blur parts of the picture while keeping others perfectly in focus, which can have a very dramatic effect. The selfie camera, which lives in a hole punch rather than a notch, is also very capable this time and can utilise any of the tools the rear shooters can. The Pro gets a slightly nicer unit, able to handle ultrawide selfies and 4K video. Google\u2019s AI is generally running unseen in the background, but anytime I fed the Pixel a tricky photo (say a 10x digital zoom with a lot of detail, or a low light image of a person with dark skin), the Pixel exceeded expectations. I also love how logical and accessible the various modes and options are in the Pixel\u2019s camera app, rather than relying on \u201cpro\u201d modes or hidden menus. With the Tensor ship enabling greater AI capabilities in real time, photos also get a few new tricks you can apply after the fact. \u201cMagic eraser\u201d can wipe objects or people from your shots, intelligently filling in the blank space so it appears they were never there. It works great with people in the background messing up your composition and, while there are sometimes artefacts left where the people used to be, you wouldn\u2019t notice unless you knew to look for it. The Pixel 6\u2019s bold look works well with software that can dynamically change the colour of widgets, icons and other UI elements. There\u2019s also \u201cFace unblur\u201d, which can analyse a pic of your fast-moving kid and restore a sharp image of their face. It doesn\u2019t work every time, but it is impressive. And since all my shots are backed up on Google Photos, I can apply either of these new tools (or add portrait blur, or denoise, or any of a raft of AI processes) to photos I took a decade ago with non-Pixel phones. And AI capabilities, of course, extend to the rest of the phone. Using your voice to type is faster and far more accurate here than on any other phone I\u2019ve used, while Pixel 6 also supports translating incoming and outgoing text messages (in various apps) on the fly so you can converse more naturally with foreign friends. Smart services like app suggestions, an enhanced At a Glance widget and the Google Assistant are customisable to be exactly as present as you\u2019d like, which is ideal. Obviously the Pixel 6 will be most helpful for people deep in the Google ecosystem. I like that Google Pay cards and Google Home smart devices are accessible directly from the phone\u2019s lockscreen for example. And the company\u2019s own apps can be set so their icons change along with your custom palette choices, which can make for a very slick or very uneven home screen depending on how many of your favourite services come from Google. Android 12 itself represents a bit of a facelift to make things bubblier and more accessible, but also hides some serious improvements like new controls to lock down apps\u2019 access to your camera and microphone, smarter auto-rotate, better search bar. And while Google\u2019s automatic colour customisation for widgets and UI might seem like a silly addition, it works with the hardware design and extremely smooth animation of the displays to make for much more pleasant and cohesive navigation than most Androids.

AFP via Getty Images Say hello to 2M0437b, one of the youngest planets ever found whose existence has finally been confirmed by astronomers. Orbiting a young red dwarf star just 400 light-years from our Solar System, it\u2019s taken astronomers three years of observations to confirm the existence of, and now directly image, the bigger-than-Jupiter planet 2M0437b. It was first found in 2018 and is a rare find. Not only is 2M0437b newly-formed several million years ago\u2014a virtual new-born star in astronomical terms\u2014but it joins an elite list of exoplanets relatively close to the Solar System that can be directly observed and even imaged by astronomers. Typically the existence of exoplanets in inferred from data. It could help astronomers learn how planets form and change with time. Here\u2019s the incredible image, which took three years to create: It took three years to image the planet 2M0437b using Keck Observatory\u2019s Near-Infrared Camera, ... [+] second generation (NIRC2) in combination with the Keck II telescope\u2019s adaptive optics system. Subaru Telescope The alien planet photo explained In this image\u2014taken using the Subaru Telescope on Maunakea in Hawaii\u2014the brighter host star, 2M0437, has been removed, which allows the planet 2M0437b to show-up (the four spikes of light are artifacts produced by the telescope\u2019s optics). MORE FOR YOU New Research Finds A Connection Between Domestic Violence And These Two Personality Disorders This Scientist Helps Andean Forests And Ecuador\u2019s Women In STEM Exceptional Fossil Preservation Suggests That Discovering Dinosaur DNA May Not Be Impossible \u201cThis serendipitous discovery adds to an elite list of planets that we can directly observe with our telescopes,\u201d said lead author Eric Gaidos, a professor in the University of Hawaii M\u0101noa Department of Earth Sciences. \u201cBy analyzing the light from this planet we can say something about its composition, and perhaps where and how it formed in a long-vanished disk of gas and dust around its host star.\u201d The research is due to be published soon in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and is now available online as a preprint . \u201cThe exquisite data from the Keck Observatory allowed us to confirm that the faint neighbor is moving through space along with its star, and thus is a true companion,\u201d said Dr. Adam Kraus, a professor in the Department of Astronomy at the University if Texas at Austin and co-author on the paper. What we know about 2M0437b The planet 2M0437b is about 400 light-years from us and lies about 100 times the Earth-Sun distance from its parent star. That huge distance makes it easier than usual to observe. 2M0437b is a few times more massive than Jupiter and thought to have formed several million years ago. It\u2019s so young that it\u2019s still hot from the energy released during its formation. The host star is an \u201cM-type\u201d or red dwarf in a star-forming region of the Milky Way galaxy called the Taurus Cloud. Although you can\u2019t see the small star with the naked eye, it\u2019s north of bright star Aldebaran and east of the Pleiades open cluster of stars. \u201cEventually, we might even be able to measure its orbital motion around the star,\u201d said Kraus. Subaru Telescope and Keck Observatory on Maunakea. University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy How 2M0437b was discovered The scientists used the W. M. Keck Observatory on Maunakea to monitor the position of the host star as it moved across the sky. They made use of Keck Observatory\u2019s second-generation Near-Infrared Camera (NIRC2) in combination with the Keck II telescope\u2019s adaptive optics (AO) system. Although the observations required three years because the star moves slowly across the sky, the researchers were able to confirm that 2M0437b was a companion to the star rather than a more distant object. The key telescope technology that allowed them to do that\u2014and which allows ground-based telescopes to find objects like 2M0437b\u2014is AO. AO is able to correct for the distortion caused by Earth\u2019s turbulent atmosphere. That\u2019s important because all of that hot, moving air makes stars appear to twinkle and blur. AO uses computers to slightly deform the telescope\u2019s mirrors, thereby correcting for any distortion. It works by using a bright star as a control (guide star or NGS), with the system monitoring how much it\u2019s blurred and distorted. When there are no bright stars lasers can be used to artificially create a point of light (laser guide star adaptive optics or LGS AO). \u201cTwo of the world\u2019s largest telescopes, adaptive optics technology, and Maunakea\u2019s clear skies were all needed to make this discovery,\u201d said co-author Michael Liu, an astronomer at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa Institute for Astronomy (IfA).

Getty Images What\u2019s next for 2M0437b It\u2019s hoped that more data can be gathered about 2M0437b, not just by other ground-based telescopes, but by space telescopes in orbit. \u201cObservations with space telescopes such as NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope and the soon-to-be-launched James Webb Space Telescope could identify gases in its atmosphere and reveal whether the planet has a moon-forming disk,\u201d said Gaidos.

    "full_description": "The Prime Minister has announced Australia\u2019s plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 following lengthy \u2014 and at times very heated \u2014 debate between the Coalition. But, the modelling which supports the plan will not be released until a later, unspecified date. Under the plan, more than $20bn will be invested in \u201clow emissions technologies\u201d, including carbon capture and storage, by 2030. It is expected to generate between $60bn and $100bn in \u201cco-investment\u201d. A \u201cnew priority\u201d to deliver \u201cultra-low-cost solar\u201d power is also included in the plan. Projections show Australia is on track to cut emissions by 30 to 35 per cent by 2030, but Scott Morrison said the formal target of a 26 to 28 per cent reduction would remain. Mr Morrison said it was important to note that in that same period of emissions reduction, since 2005, the GDP had grown by 45 per cent. Mr Morrison stressed that the national plan would ensure net zero was met by 2050 through \u201ctechnology, not taxes\u201d, with investments in a portfolio of technologies and incentives on offer. \u201cAustralia has already achieved more than a 20 per cent reduction in our emissions since 2005,\u201d Mr Morrison told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re getting it done on emissions reduction. \u201cAustralians want action on climate change ... but they also want to protect their jobs and their livelihoods. \u201cThey also want to keep the cost of living down and they also want to protect the Australian way of life, especially in rural and regional areas.\u201d Mr Morrison said his government\u2019s plan got the \u201cbalance right\u201d and \u201ccharts a uniquely Australian way\u201d. \u201cOur plan is a fair plan, it\u2019s a practical plan ... it\u2019s been carefully put together.\u201d The Prime Minister said his government had listened to the concerns and ambitions of Australians, describing the plan as an energy, trade and economic plan \u2014 not just an environmental one. As part of the plan, technology costs will be driven down for companies involved in developing clean hydrogen, solar, energy storage, low emissions steel and aluminium, carbon capture and storage, and soil carbon, as well as emerging technologies. Soil carbon and carbon capture and store methods will play a major component in driving down emissions. By 2050, emissions will have reduced 131-278 per cent in sectors using those methods. Clean hydrogen will be central for electricity, transport, industry, mining, manufacturing and agriculture sectors. Mr Morrison said regional and rural Australians should feel confident that the plan was safeguarding their future. \u201cI say to the people of rural and regional Australia \u2014 this is a good plan for you. You can plan for your future in confidence,\u201d Mr Morrison said. The coalition has been divided on the plan, and earlier, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese called the process of the government\u2019s climate policy a \u201cshambles\u201d. He said they are \u201ccommitting the fatal mistake of wanting to provide two contradictory messages to different parts of the country\u201d. \u201cMatt Canavan has already flagged that they can have a different view on net zero after the election,\u201d Mr Albanese said. While the junior coalition partner agreed \u201cin principle\u201d to the net zero by 2050 target, Senator Matt Canavan told ABC Radio National on Tuesday he would \u201ccontinue to campaign against the policy\u201d, and that Australia should be \u201cgrowing the coal industry\u201d. \u201cCoal prices have never been higher, they are at record highs,\u201d Mr Canavan said. \u201cThere is so much demand for this product and yet (voters) don\u2019t see a government in Canberra backing them.\u201d Grilled about when the actual plan would be revealed publicly, Mr Morrison said all of his policies would come out before the next election. \u201cAll of our policies, investments in the regions and additional investments in a whole range of areas will be outlined,\u201d he said. One journalist noted the past six prime ministers had either lost subsequent elections or were dumped by their own parties after announcing climate policies, and asked Mr Morrison what gave him confidence that he would survive. \u201cI have brought our government together on this. Our government is committed to this. Our government has come from difficult places, had hard discussions, but we\u2019ve worked through it together and we\u2019ve come to this position,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2018ve respected each other. We have listened to each other and we have constructed over a long period of time a careful plan that is conscious of the impacts and the opportunities, and enables Australians to keep doing what they are doing and do even more by encouraging them through the measures that we\u2019ve got. \u201cWe have set out clear principles which we will honour.\u201d Scott Morrison has unveiled a landmark climate deal for Australia, committing to a carbon neutral future by 2050. Leaked documents have revealed the Australian government tried to convince the UN to water down one of its most important climate reports. The Nationals have promised to \u201cterminate\u201d Scott Morrison\u2019s net zero target through a bizarre video featuring Matt Canavan as Arnold Schwarzenegger.",

    "full_description": "A personal decision by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg leads to a crackdown on dissent in Vietnam. Measures to suppress hateful, deceptive content are lifted after the American presidential election in 2020, as pro-Trump groups disputing the legitimacy of the election experience \u201cmeteoric\u201d growth. A dummy test account on Facebook in India is flooded with violent anti-Muslim propaganda \u2013 which remains visible for weeks on the real account of a frightened Muslim college student in northern India. A trove of internal Facebook documents reveals that the social media giant has privately and meticulously tracked real-world harms exacerbated by its platforms, ignored warnings from its employees about the risks of their design decisions and exposed vulnerable communities around the world to a cocktail of dangerous content. Disclosed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission by whistleblower Frances Haugen, the Facebook Papers were provided to Congress in redacted form by Haugen\u2019s legal counsel. The redacted versions were reviewed by a consortium of news organisations, including The Washington Post, which obtained additional internal documents and conducted interviews with dozens of current and former Facebook employees. Late last year, Mark Zuckerberg faced a choice: Comply with demands from Vietnam\u2019s ruling Communist Party to censor anti-government dissidents or risk getting knocked offline in one of Facebook\u2019s most lucrative Asian markets. In America, the tech CEO is a champion of free speech, reluctant to remove even malicious and misleading content from the platform. But in Vietnam, upholding the free speech rights of people who question government leaders could have come with a significant cost in a country where the social network earns more than $1bn (\u20ac800m) in annual revenue, according to a 2018 estimate by Amnesty International. So Zuckerberg personally decided that Facebook would comply with Hanoi\u2019s demands, according to three people familiar with the decision, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe internal company discussions. Ahead of Vietnam\u2019s party congress in January, Facebook significantly increased censorship of \u201canti-state\u201d posts, giving the government near-total control over the platform, according to local activists and free speech advocates. Zuckerberg\u2019s role in the Vietnam decision, which has not been previously reported, exemplifies his relentless determination to ensure Facebook\u2019s dominance, sometimes at the expense of his stated values, according to interviews with more than a dozen former employees. That ethos has come under fire in a series of whistleblower complaints filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission by former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen. While it\u2019s unclear whether the SEC will take the case or pursue action against the CEO personally, the allegations made by the whistleblower represent arguably the most profound challenge to Zuckerberg\u2019s ironclad leadership of the most powerful social media company on Earth. Experts said the SEC \u2013 which has the power to seek depositions, fine him and even remove him as chairman \u2013 is likely to dig more deeply into what he knew and when. Though his direct perspective is rarely reflected in the documents, the people who worked with him say his fingerprints are everywhere in them. 7 Things: Adrian Weckler on Tech Tech\u2019s stars and turkeys rounded up and served to you every Friday by Ireland\u2019s No. 1 technology writer. Enter email address This field is required Sign Up Haugen references Zuckerberg\u2019s public statements at least 20 times in her SEC complaints, asserting that the CEO\u2019s singular power and unique level of control over Facebook mean he bears ultimate responsibility for a litany of societal harms. Her documents appear to contradict the CEO on a host of issues, including the platform\u2019s impact on children\u2019s mental health, whether its algorithms contribute to polarisation and how much hate speech it detects around the world. For example, Zuckerberg testified last year before Congress that the company removes 94pc of the hate speech it finds \u2013 but internal documents show that its researchers estimated that the company was removing less than 5pc of hate speech on Facebook. In March, Zuckerberg told Congress that it was \u201cnot at all clear\u201d that social networks polarise people, when Facebook\u2019s own researchers had repeatedly found that they do. During the run-up to the 2020 US presidential election, the social media giant dialled up efforts to police content that promoted violence, misinformation and hate speech. But after November 6, Facebook rolled back many of the dozens of measures aimed at safeguarding US users. A ban on the main Stop the Steal group didn\u2019t apply to the dozens of look-alike groups that popped up in what the company later concluded was a \u201ccoordinated\u201d campaign, documents show. By the time Facebook tried to reimpose its \u201cbreak the glass\u201d measures, it was too late: A pro-Trump mob was storming the US Capitol. For all Facebook\u2019s troubles in North America, its problems with hate speech and misinformation are dramatically worse in the developing world. Documents show that Facebook has meticulously studied its approach abroad, and is well aware that weaker moderation in non-English-speaking countries leaves the platform vulnerable to abuse by bad actors and authoritarian regimes. According to one 2020 summary, the vast majority of its efforts against misinformation \u2013 84pc \u2013 went toward the United States, the documents show, with just 16pc going to the \u2018Rest of World\u2019, including India, France and Italy. In her congressional testimony, Haugen repeatedly accused Zuckerberg of choosing growth over the public good, an allegation echoed in interviews with the former employees. \u201cThe spectre of Zuckerberg looms in everything the company does,\u201d said Brian Boland, ex-vice president of partnerships and marketing who left in 2020 after coming to believe the platform was polarising society. \u201cIt is entirely driven by him.\u201d A Facebook spokeswoman, Dani Lever, denied that decisions made by Zuckerberg \u201ccause harm\u201d, saying the claim was based on \u201cselected documents that are mischaracterised and devoid of any context\u201d. Facebook has previously fought efforts to hold Zuckerberg personally accountable. In 2019, as the company was facing a record-breaking $5bn (\u20ac4.3bn) fine from the Federal Trade Commission for privacy violations related to Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that abused profile data from tens of millions of Facebook users, Facebook negotiated to protect Zuckerberg from direct liability. Internal Facebook briefing materials revealed the tech giant was willing to abandon settlement talks and duke it out in court if the agency insisted on pursuing the CEO. Zuckerberg, who is 37, founded Facebook 17 years ago in his college dorm room, envisioning a new way for classmates to connect with one another. Today, Facebook has become a conglomerate encompassing WhatsApp, Instagram and a hardware business. Zuckerberg is chairman of the board and controls 58pc of the company\u2019s voting shares, rendering his power virtually unchecked internally at the company and by the board. Even as the company has grown into a large conglomerate, Zuckerberg has maintained a reputation as a hands-on manager who goes deep on product and policy decisions, particularly when they involve critical trade-offs between preserving speech and protecting users from harm \u2013 or between safety and growth. Politically, he has developed hard-line positions on free speech, announcing that he would allow politicians to lie in ads and at one time defending the rights of Holocaust denialists. He has publicly stated that he made the final call in the company\u2019s most sensitive content decisions to date, including allowing President Donald Trump\u2019s violence-inciting post during the George Floyd protests to stay up, despite objections from thousands of employees. But even as Facebook is facing perhaps its most existential crisis to date over the whistleblower documents, lately Zuckerberg\u2019s attention has been elsewhere, focused on a push toward virtual-reality hardware in what former executives said was an attempt to distance himself from the problems of the core Facebook, known internally as the Big Blue app. The company is reportedly even considering changing its name to align better with his vision of a virtual-reality-driven \u201cmetaverse.\u201d Facebook has said it doesn\u2019t comment on rumours or speculation. The fomer employees said it was also not surprising that the document trove contains so few references to Zuckerberg\u2019s thoughts. He has become more isolated in recent years, in the face of mounting scandals and leaks (Facebook disputes his isolation). Even criticising Zuckerberg personally can come with costs. An engineer who spoke with The Post, and whose story was reflected in the documents, says he was fired in 2020 after penning an open letter to Zuckerberg on the company\u2019s chat system, accusing the CEO of responsibility for protecting conservatives whose accounts had been escalated for misinformation. One document, a 2020 proposal that indicates it was sent to Zuckerberg for review \u2013 over whether to hide like counts on Instagram and Facebook \u2013 strongly suggests that Zuckerberg was directly aware of some of the research into harmful effects It included internal research from 2018 that found that 37pc of teenagers said one reason that they stopped posting content was because wanting to get enough like counts caused them \u201cstress or anxiety\u201d. Over the summer, executives in Facebook\u2019s Washington office heard that Zuckerberg was angry about President Biden\u2019s charge that coronavirus misinformation on Facebook was \u201ckilling people\u201d. Zuckerberg felt Biden had unfairly targeted the company and wanted to fight back, according to people who heard a key Zuckerberg adviser, Facebook Vice President for Global Affairs Nick Clegg, express the CEO\u2019s viewpoint. Zuckerberg is married to a doctor, runs a foundation focused on health issues and had hoped that Facebook\u2019s ability to help people during the pandemic would be legacy-making. Instead, the plan was going south. In July, Guy Rosen, Facebook\u2019s vice president for integrity, wrote a blog post noting that Facebook had missed its own vaccine goals, and asserting that Facebook wasn\u2019t to blame for the large number of Americans who refused to get vaccinated. Though Biden later backed off his comment, some former executives saw Facebook\u2019s attack on the White House as unnecessary self-sabotage. But complaints about the brash action were met with a familiar response, three people said: It was meant to please the \u201caudience of one\u201d.

    "pubDate": "2021-10-26 01:12:00",
    "full_description": "Scott Morrison has committed to a carbon neutral future for Australia by 2050. Releasing his climate change plan today, he also revealed for the first time that emissions are forecast to fall by 30-35% on 2005 levels by 2030. The prediction is not a new 2030 target as climate change activists had called for but rather an updated forecast. As expected, the big announcement was that Australia will sign on to a net zero by 2050 target. Declaring climate change was \u201creal\u201d the Prime Minister said he would deliver a plan that relied on technology. \u201cThis is real. It\u2019s happening. We understand that,\u201d Mr Morrison said. He vowed that the plan is \u201ca good plan for all Australians\u201d, including those in the regions, adding he was \u201cconfident that it is going to secure your future, that you can plan for your future with confidence\u201d. \u201cAnd we\u2019re backing that up by ensuring that we won\u2019t just be measuring the fact that we\u2019ll be reducing emissions, we\u2019ll be measuring the fact that we\u2019re creating jobs, we\u2019ll be measuring the fact that we\u2019re boosting incomes, we\u2019ll be measuring the fact that we are preserving Australians\u2019 livelihoods, right across the country, because that is also one of the key measures of performance and success with this plan,\u201d Mr Morrison said. The plan will see more than $20 billion invested in \u201clow-emissions technologies\u201d by 2030, including soil carbon sequestration, production of low-emissions steel, and using \u201cclean hydrogen\u201d to lower fuel emissions. A \u201cnew priority\u201d for the Federal Government to deliver \u201cultra-low-cost solar\u201d power below $15 per megawatt-hour is also included. While the 26 to 28 per cent reduction target remains, new data projections \u201cwill see us exceed our 2030 target with emissions reduction of up to 35 per cent by 2030\u201d, the PM said. \u201cWe said there\u2019s the mark, but we can meet it, and we can beat it. And we will, and the world will be able to see us achieving that. And they\u2019ll be able to take record of that,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause what Australians are doing now is getting results, and they\u2019re going to keep getting results, and they\u2019re going to keep getting better results. \u201cSo we will honour our commitment to the Australian people. That\u2019s what I took to them. That\u2019s what they approved. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. And we will continue to work to do even better, as part of our plan.\u201d Repeatedly grilled over when Australians will be able to see the plan \u2013 and the carbon emissions modelling it\u2019s based on \u2013 Mr Morrison demurred, saying it \u201cwill be released in due course\u201d. \u201cToday is about the plan. We will be releasing modelling at another time,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of our policies will come out before the next election. In particular, there will be a budget next year, [it] is our intention, but either way all of our policies we will make decisions about that closer to that time. \u201cAll of our policy, investments in the regions and additional investments in a whole range of areas will be outlined as they have been outlined in these many years since the last election. \u201cIt will all be out there for everyone to read about what we are investing in and how we are investing in it because at the end of the day, now that we are passed the by, when and if, and now that we are into the how, what this is a real choice of now is the economic plan of the Government \u2013 the Liberals and the Nationals \u2013 to steer Australia through what will be a challenging time with the global response to climate change, and how we intend to realise those opportunities.\u201d Mr Morrison will confirm the government\u2019s net zero position when he attends the United Nations COP26 climate conference in Glasgow next week. The Prime Minister has finally revealed Australia\u2019s plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 following lengthy debate between the Coalition. Leaked documents have revealed the Australian government tried to convince the UN to water down one of its most important climate reports. The Nationals have promised to \u201cterminate\u201d Scott Morrison\u2019s net zero target through a bizarre video featuring Matt Canavan as Arnold Schwarzenegger.",

There are a number of flagship undenominated degrees (in arts, business, science and engineering) which allow students to study the subject very broadly in the first year and then specialise and choose more focused pathways in the following years. These are very popular degrees at NUI Galway as students enjoy the flexibility and opportunity to study a variety of modules early in the degree to get a feel for them and then make decisions about specialisation and specific careers later in their college studies. GY101, the joint honours arts degree is the university\u2019s most popular degree with over 365 different subject combinations. What\u2019s new? The flagship joint honours arts degree has two new subjects for entry in 2022. Performance and Screen Studies draws together two academic disciplines, performance studies and screen studies, to create a unique subject that involves the lecture-based study of drama, film, television, social media, sporting events, gaming, streaming platforms, political activism and more. The second new subject, international development, is an interdisciplinary subject combining themes of rights and equality, sustainable development, business development, policy and international development practice. The subject includes a work placement and will appeal to students who want to impact the lives of those living in developing countries. A further new subject/stream; climate physics will be available from 2022 to students of science and BSc (physics), and will focus on understanding the physics of climate change from a rigorous science perspective. Accommodation: NUI Galway\u2019s student residences comprises two villages, Corrib Village and Goldcrest Village. Located on campus, they provide a home away from home for nearly 1,200 students during the academic year. Bookings for 2022/2023 will open in early spring 2022.

    "description": "Open days are no longer just for students: they\u2019re also a chance for parents or guardians to find out more about where their child might be going to third level. Over the past 18 months, these events have largely, if not exclusively, taken place online, opening up even more opportunities for parents to get involved. \u201cThe increased availability of digital content by all higher education institutions over the last 18 months, in response to the Covid-19 restrictions, means it has never been easier for parents to quickly and efficiently access the relevant information they need to support their son or daughter\u2019s CAO application,\u201d says Sarah Geraghty, director of student recruitment and outreach at NUI Galway. \u201cThe virtual experience cannot match the sense of possibility that a student gets from visiting a campus in person, however the online open days do have their benefits, and particularly so for parents.\u201d Of course, it\u2019s parents and guardians who will be stumping up the cost of overpriced student accommodation and the highest college fees in the European Union, and they want the best for their child, so it\u2019s no surprise that they\u2019d attend these events. But, that said, it is students who will be attending the college and course, so they need to take the lead. Ground rules So, what can a parent learn at college open day and what should they look out for? How can they best support their child and not take over the process? And should there be ground rules to avoid any potential conflict? John McGinnity is the admissions officer and assistant registrar at Maynooth University. \u201cEvery student is unique and so, while some will want their parents sitting further away from them in a lecture theatre, others might be comfortable sitting beside them,\u201d he says. \u201cOthers may just want their parents or guardians to drive them to and from the event and pay for lunch. There\u2019s a part in the middle where parents and students will go their own ways.\u201d For some teenagers, there is nobody more embarrassing in their parents, although that surly teenager can be a stereotyped clich\u00e9. But, again, everyone will have different feelings. \u201cI\u2019d encourage parents or guardians to be alert to what works for their child,\u201d says McGinnity. \u201cIf they\u2019re at, say, the psychology stand and the parent is asking all the questions, the student is missing out on a learning opportunity.\u201d McGinnity advises parents to keep in mind that a lot has changed since they may have been in college themselves. \u201cToday, there are many different pathways to particular careers, and while it might feel like there is only one course in one college to get to a particular career, bear in mind that students can follow broad interests in their undergraduate course and then do a more focused postgraduate. There are great pathways between level six/seven courses and level eight, while the pathways between further and higher education are becoming ever-more accessible.\u201d Realistically, students can get a better sense of the campus environment when they are physically there, although Covid restrictions mean that this isn\u2019t always possible. \u201cIf there is one thing that a parent can do it is to be the resource that takes them to the various campuses, if possible,\u201d says McGinnity. \u201cThere can often be a moment when a student is walking around the campus and they know it is where they want to be.\u201d Speaking very broadly and generally, research shows that girls may have put a little more thought into their college course choice, having been reflecting on it since transition year. Boys, however, can be a little more inclined to wait until sixth year and leave things until the last minute. \u201cThe decision around the right course, college or pathway is not a moment in time, it is a process over a period of time where a student comes to understand their own innate skills, talents and interests,\u201d says McGinnity. \u201cIf you do it over two or three years it\u2019s more of a marathon than a sprint because they\u2019ve had more time to reflect on it.\u201d The ongoing failure to provide adequate and affordable accommodation for students and the high cost of college can lead to some difficult conversations. For a student who is keen to move away from home for college \u2013 whether because they\u2019re itching for independence or because there is a particular course they have in mind \u2013 practical, financial considerations may put a halt to their ambitions. \u201cIt should, in the first instance, be a student\u2019s decision as to where to apply for college,\u201d says McGinnity. \u201cThere is a likelihood of students on the east coast going to a university on the east coast, within a commutable distance, and the recent budget has changed the adjacent rate for the SUSI grant from 45km to 30km (which means that students living closer to their college will be entitled to a higher grant). It is likely that there will still be a scarcity of accommodation in 2022.\u201d Events for parents: What\u2019s happening? A small selection of some parent events: * On Friday, November 19th, between 5-6pm, Dublin City University is hosting an online event for parents looking at how they should approach their son\u2019s or daughter\u2019s path to third-level education. Topics include the costs involved in attending college, supports available to students, what parents and guardians should look out for any issues that may arise. * UCC\u2019s Open Day platform has a special booth for parents and guardians, packed with useful material. See ucc.ie/openday for more details. UCC will also be hosting live CAO Q&A sessions on January 19th and May 4th, 2022, and parents and guardians are welcome to attend. UCC has also created a free online course, Nurturing Bright Futures where young adults can reflect on their personality, likes, dislikes and educational preferences. Parents and guardians can help them work through this. The university has created a special parent/guardian booklet, where they have outlined sections in which they can help the young person in their life by checking in on their progress. For a hard copy, email graduateattributes@ucc.ie or download the digital version at ucc.ie/nurturingbrightfutures. * NUI Galway\u2019s undergraduate open day took place on October 2nd, with more than 90 virtual exhibition booths and 75 talks and presentations, says Sarah Geraghty of NUI Galway. \u201cMany of these talks and presentations will be available on demand on the NUI Galway website, affording parents, who are not always available to attend multiple open days due to busy work and family commitments, the opportunity to watch back talks in their own time.\u201d These talks include information on where an NUI Galway degree will take you, student life at NUI Galway and preparing for college in 2022. Emer Neville: \u2018It has to be the student\u2019s decision as to what they study, and it\u2019s important that they do something they want to do, otherwise there\u2019s a chance they will drop out.\u2019 My experience: Emer Neville, president of the Irish Second-Level Students\u2019 Union \u201cI went to open days during transition year, when I really began to think of college. Some of these were online and some involved campus visits. \u201cI\u2019m from Clonmel in Tipperary and, early on, I knew I could not go to Dublin because of the high cost of rent, so I looked at Galway and Cork. \u201cI was 16 when I went to the open days at UCC, CIT (now Munster Technological Union), NUI Galway and GMIT. The whole family went to these open days, including my twin brother and my sister, who was in sixth year at the time. \u201cMost of my peers had their parents with them, unless they\u2019d gone to the open day with the school. My parents were there in the background to see the campus, where we might be living and what the facilities were like, but I took the lead when it came to looking into the course details. \u201cIt has to be the student\u2019s decision as to what they study, and it\u2019s important that they do something they want to do, otherwise there\u2019s a chance they will drop out. \u201cIt\u2019s also important to have a look at the city or town that the college is in, not just the campus. UCC is very close to the city centre, which makes it very walkable; UL is further out from the city centre but has lots of facilities on campus. \u201cWhile it\u2019s fine to bring the parents, students should take ownership of their education, because by the time they get to college they\u2019ll be an adult and expected to do things without their parents.\u201d",

    "full_description": "Let\u2019s address the two-dozen little elephants in the room: Swapping all of my smart home devices to a new Wi-Fi network should not be as annoying as it is. I recently switched to a new router, which means the SSID (network name) changed. Every smart device in my home had to be reconnected to the new network, but what I found is that there is no cohesive way to do that. This is further exacerbated by the fact that certain devices, like the Amazon Echo, require you to press a physical button on the device as part of the change. Smart home technology is only as smart as its weakest link, and the difficulty in swapping networks is unnecessarily frustrating. Smart home tech needs to be accessible in one place A smart home hub should function as a central control, rather than just a way to quickly control devices . The most-used system in my home is Alexa, and I use the Alexa app to monitor and control the majority of devices throughout my home. If the device is Amazon-branded, I can change its network through the Alexa app. However, with any other brand, I have to download that specific app just to tweak a few settings. Some of these apps I no longer have on my phone. Take TP-Link as an example. I used it to set up several smart plugs, but that was two years ago. The plugs can all be controlled through the Alexa app, so when I upgraded my phone, I never downloaded the TP-Link app. There was \u2014 and should still be \u2014 no need. If I can control a device through Alexa, I should also be able to change its Wi-Fi network through Alexa. If my Echo Show acts as a smart home hub, compatible devices should grant full and total control from the hub \u2014 not doing so negates the purpose of using a hub. Smart home products should connect to the phone\u2019s Wi-Fi I have never used anything except my mobile device to set up a smart home product. Sure, it could be done using a tablet or an iPad , but the phone is the default system. Why, then, do the devices not automatically opt to connect to the phone\u2019s network during the setup phase? Some devices do ask if you\u2019d like to connect to the current network, and that\u2019s a step in the right direction. Others create their own local area network for the purpose of setting up the device, a step that has only ever created further complications. If my phone is connected to a given Wi-Fi network as I\u2019m setting up a smart home device, it should automatically choose that network rather than asking. A secondary selection screen that confirms the choice would be acceptable in case I had a secondary home network that I preferred the devices be on, but then again, why wouldn\u2019t my phone also be on that network? I do not want to reset devices when I switch networks Another huge annoyance lies in smart home devices that have to be reset when you swap networks. My Google Nest Hub is like this; when I swap it to a different Wi-Fi network, I sometimes have to reset the entire device and wipe it of all settings. It\u2019s tedious enough to manually change the Wi-Fi address in each device \u2014 going through the setup process as well just makes it worse. Google Although many device settings are stored on my phone, if I have to remove the device from the app and delete it from the home setup to be able to reinstall it, I lose those settings. Glitches happen from time to time, but the consistency with which Nest products have required this step is infuriating. The root of the problem lies in the programming of the devices, but also in the networking . If your Wi-Fi network goes down, you cannot easily control your smart home devices without erasing them and putting them into setup mode again. If I could control my products through Bluetooth as easily as through Wi-Fi, the loss of a network wouldn\u2019t eliminate my ability to control them. It would also allow my smart home devices to work if the internet were down. A lot of devices can be controlled through both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, but it\u2019s an odd oversight that they can\u2019t all be controlled this way. Matter hopefully poses a solution Despite encountering this problem on numerous occasions, I can\u2019t think of a solution that properly addresses the connectivity issues. The only platform that offers any real solution is Matter . The Matter Protocol has generated a lot of excitement in the smart home world. Many users place a lot of their hopes in this platform and its promises to tear down the walled gardens of the Alexa, Google Assistant, and HomeKit ecosystems. Matter promises to facilitate greater connectivity between smart home devices, even those that traditionally have not worked together. This improved connectivity might be able to do away with the need to set up devices through individual apps. At the very least, it might allow users to set up smart home devices through a hub \u2014 and that would handle a lot of the issues with swapping from one Wi-Fi network to another. No one is quite sure how Matter will work in practice. The ideal solution would be a unique way of transmitting data and information to all of your devices at once through a hub. The Amazon Echo Show is one of the few devices that you set up entirely on-device thanks to its screen. It can also act as a hub. If these features were somehow combined, it might be possible to change the Wi-Fi network on all of your smart home devices at one time. Again, this is speculation \u2014 the desperate search for an answer from someone who has grown tired of the tedium. At this point, I could enter my Wi-Fi name and password with my eyes closed and both hands tied behind my back. Swiping the text into my phone has become as familiar as my own signature. There has to be an easier solution. Smart home technology has come a long way from its early days, when installation and control were much more difficult and opaque. Even with that in mind, I feel like it still has a long way to go before these small issues are completely dealt with.

    "description": "New minimum pay rates for more than 50,000 construction workers will come into force from February 1st, under plans announced on Monday. Under the new minimum rates, approved by Minister of State at the Department of Trade and Employment Damien English, workers can also expect pay increases in February 2023, of just under 3 per cent. According to the new scales a craftsperson will be paid at least \u20ac20.52 per hour from next February, increasing to \u20ac21.09 an hour from February 1st, 2023. A \u201ccategory A\u201d worker \u2013 such as a heavy machine operator or scaffolder with four years\u2019 experience \u2013 must be paid at least \u20ac19.91 per hour, increasing to \u20ac20.47 from February 2023. A \u201ccategory B\u201d worker \u2013 or skilled general operative with more than two years\u2019 experience \u2013 will be paid a minimum of \u20ac18.47, going up to \u20ac18.99. Apprentices will be entitled to 33 per cent of the craft rates in the first year, 50 per cent in their second, 75 per cent in their third and 90 per cent in their fourth. These will be set out in a sectoral employment order (SEO) to be brought to the Oireachtas by Mr English \u201cin coming weeks\u201d, his department said. Rates are also set in the recommendation from the Labour Court for pension contributions by employers and workers and for sick-pay schemes to which all workers in workplaces subject to these rates are entitled. The new rates come into force following an application to the court by five trade unions in the sector \u2013 Unite; Opatsi, which represents plasters; the Bricklayers and Allied Trades Union; Siptu; and Connect, which represents electricians and technicians \u2013 for a review of pay. Supreme Court ruling This followed a Supreme Court ruling in June upholding the constitutionality of provisions in the Industrial Relations Amendment Act 2015 for the making of SEOs. The timings and the increases recommended by the court strike a balance between the demands of unions and employers. While the former had sought increases of 4.4 per cent and for the new rates to come into force this month, employers had asked that increases be struck considerably lower, at 1.6 per cent, and for the orders to apply from next April. Commenting on the new rates, Mr English said they represented \u201can important step in securing stability and growth in this crucial sector of the Irish economy\u201d. \u201cThis order will protect the working conditions of workers in the construction sector; will underpin continued good relations between workers and employers in the sector; and will help maintain the attractiveness of this sector as a viable career option,\u201d he said. \u201cThe recommendation is the third such recommendation from the Labour Court in the construction sector. The recommendation, if approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas, will take effect by means of an SEO, and will amend Statutory Instrument 234 of 2019.\u201d",

    "description": "Many principals preparing their open evenings for post-primary schools over the last few weeks have had to describe \u201cuniversal design for learning\u201d to parents and students for the first time. This is a direct consequence of many schools having to migrate to digital platforms such as Edmodo, Google Classroom or Microsoft Teams during the pandemic. So, what exactly is Universal Design for Learning, or UDL? When designing learning materials, especially digital learning materials, we need to involve those for whom we are designing. It is only once this group\u2019s diverse needs are established that you can start to design and develop optimal learning resources (both traditional hard copy and digital). Accessibility, inclusion and UDL cannot be treated as add-ons. They must be factored in from the very beginning of the design process. The rapid adoption of ICT calls for rapid adoption of accessibility principles. While there is an EU web accessibility directive in place, how this is implemented varies hugely from country to country. The EU-funded project Lead-Me involving 28 countries is exploring the guidelines and curricula for teaching and training media accessibility. The project is exploring the optimal use of subtitles, speech recognition software and easy-to-understand language. Accessible It is difficult to differentiate between accessible and inclusive. Accessible tries to cater for the widest range of user needs whereas for a resource to be inclusive we are designing something that everyone can use. Accessibility is not possible without inclusion. Some digital resources carry a high risk of cognitive overload. There may be many elements competing for attention on the screen including text, images, sound, moving objects, navigation, individual students capacity varies widely. Regarding UDL, the school environment can be defined in terms of academic, administrative and wider community contexts. When designing with UDL in mind, we include the creation of learning materials by teachers and students and the potential of good practice to maximise the communicative impact of the resource. UDL principles can also be applied to administrative environments such as the design of teacher and student journals. Learning management systems, which are easy to use, and generate clear student reports and certificates are another example. Last, resources designed to support communication within the school community also play a key role. School apps which relay school news as well as providing authoring tools for parents to write sick notes should conform to UDL guidelines. Schools may consider using alternative text on websites and social media accounts to describe images as well as including multilingual sound files for textual information on the web page. This creates a more inclusive and accessible experience for parents, students, and teachers. Assessment The new junior cycle has triggered the emergence of new forms of assessment, including oral communication supported by written slides. These alternative assessments have emerged as viable tasks within subjects such as business, science and geography and it is probable that this type of assessment will also continue through to the new senior cycle experience for students. Therefore, it is really the responsibility of educators and other stakeholders to ensure that students are equipped with the appropriate skill set. It is also critical that students form good habits when preparing presentations that will allow them to transfer these skills from senior cycle to third level or to a workplace. During the pandemic many students were, and are, continuing to use mobile phones to create these presentations; this can be quite challenging and can impede the quality of the resource that is being produced. We are now at a pivotal moment regarding reform of senior cycle. It is important that as we explore alternative and different forms of assessments that we equip students with appropriate skills to maximize their learning potential within these possibilities that may be afforded to us in the future. For students producing work by hand, it is important that they also adhere to the principles of UDL. Many students use a digital pen for both homework and individual note taking and revision. It is important that they understand how to produce digitally handwritten notes correctly, such as selection of font colour, nib size and organisation of content. Accessibility awareness of the student\u2019s own needs for revision as well as the teacher\u2019s needs for correction of work would be key components of implementing UDL into daily classroom tasks. Teachers are exploring alternative ways to provide feedback via audio voice notes as well as correcting with a digital pen. Applying the principles of UDL to the design for feedback templates (written or audio) may also enhance the learning experience. There is an optional short course provided by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on digital media literacy, but there is a need for some instruction in key design principles. Such principles should include some instruction on choice of typefaces, colour choices for text and graphics, data visualisation and information design. Such instruction would allow for a more clear and coherent communication of material in text and audiovisual format. Excellent digital teaching and learning materials that comply with the key principles of UDL need to be available to students at all schools, across all social backgrounds, not just schools that have the resources to create excellent learning materials.

But, if that\u2019s not realistic, work to get yourself \u2014 or at least your ideas \u2014 into the boardroom. Just because you don\u2019t have a standing invite doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t have an impact. To get your message across to time-strapped executives (or just about anyone for that matter), you need to meet them where they are. You already know why cybersecurity investment is essential to your role. Now step into your leadership\u2019s shoes to explain why it\u2019s crucial to theirs.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Enteric Diseases Laboratory Branch (EDLB) preparing samples for \u201cDNA fingerprinting\u201d CDC via Unsplash Recent advancements in biotechnology have immense potential to help address many global problems; climate change, an aging society, food security, energy security, and infectious diseases. Biotechnology is not to be confused with the closely related field of biosciences. While biosciences refer to all the sciences that study and understand life, biology, and biological organisms, biotechnology refers to the application of the knowledge of biosciences and other technologies to develop tech and commercial products. Biotechnology is the application of innovation to biosciences in a bid to solve real-world medical problems. Throw Artificial Intelligence into the mix and we suddenly have a really interesting pot of broth. Several AI trends have already proven beneficial to the development of biotechnology. Dr. Nathan S. Bryan, an inventor, biochemist and professor, who made a name for himself as an innovator and pioneer in nitric oxide drug discovery, commercialization, and molecular medicine, offers his insights on these contributions. Bryan has always held a strong interest in science and medicine and the innovations surrounding it, as signified in his insistence on the commercialization of his nitric oxide discoveries amid strong criticism and even opposition amongst his peers.. His strong entrepreneurial spirit as an academic was strange to many but has led to dozens of patents and product technology that have now generated over half a billion dollars in sales worldwide and an enterprise value of all his companies at over one billion dollars. He is optimistic that AI has great potential to revolutionize the biotechnology industry if handled right. \u201cOver the last 3 decades we have made tremendous strides in scientific discoveries that have become very impactful in drug development, health, wellness, and beauty,\u201d says Bryan. MORE FOR YOU Black Google Product Manager Stopped By Security Because They Didn\u2019t Believe He Was An Employee Vendor Management Is The New Customer Management, And AI Is Transforming The Sector Already What Are The Ethical Boundaries Of Digital Life Forever? \u201cAll this was done mainly without Artificial Intelligence, imagine what we can achieve if the various concerns are handled and we can utilize the great advantage of machine learning to the fullest? Historically it takes an average of 17 years for a new discovery to come to market. Utilizing AI, it can happen much faster. It\u2019s a game-changer if I ever saw one.\u201d AI-Generated Comprehensive Protein Map Earlier this year the biotechnology world was rocked by an announcement by DeepMind , a subsidiary of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. DeepMinds claimed to create the most comprehensive map of proteins to date using artificial intelligence. Every investigation so far suggests that this is exactly what they have done. Before this breakthrough, determining the structure of a protein could only be done by a series of expensive and time-consuming experiments. However, DeepMind showed that relying on Alphafold, its AI software, it could produce accurate predictions of a protein\u2019s structure . This extended the list of protein structures available in the public domain from 180,000, to a whopping 350,000 and everything can be downloaded by scientists for free. Perhaps the most profound part of this is that the list included 98% of all human proteins, which is astounding for scientists and researchers. Bryan seems certain that this is just the tip of the iceberg for what is attainable. In his own words; \u201cI can now go to the internet and download the most comprehensive list of human proteins ever into a memory stick. Frankly, that is an unexpected deluge of data, that we still don\u2019t know how to process, it is like taking us 10 years ahead in research. Its impact will probably not be felt in how people are treated instantly, but in the long run, it would have saved us a lot of years,\u201d says Bryan. He continues, \u201cIt only goes to show you why a lot of us in the scientific community are excited about the positive possibilities of AI. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Knowing a protein\u2019s structure helps us understand its function and how to repair it if an enzyme becomes dysfunctional. Many diseases, including many caused by a deficiency of nitric oxide are due to dysfunctional enzymes.\u201d Open Source AI Platforms Health care data and other scientific data are an ever-expanding library. The data is often scattered and complicated to arrange in any meaningful way without intense laborious work. Scientists around the world are researching AI programs that can automate data maintenance and analysis. AI opensource platforms have become the answer to this desire in many ways. Open source platforms like H2O.ai, and DeepMIB have emerged in the last few years to free lab assistants from repetitive tasks such as data entry and analysis. Bryan expands on the value of AI-open source platforms; \u201cResearch is a bigger deal than most people understand. A lot of tasks are heavy and repetitive, yet they have to be done repeatedly with the utmost care because every research failure is a lot of money and energy down the drain. Most basic science discoveries never lead to any effective medicine or therapy because it fails to translate into humans.\u201d Dr. Nathan S. Bryan Dr. Nathan S. Bryan He continues, \u201cIn the science of nitric oxide, which is a gas that when produced is gone in less than a second, it has been very difficult to develop safe and effective therapeutics. We were the first to develop a solid dose of the nitric oxide gas.\u201d \u201cUsing AI platforms, we can monitor in real time changes in important vital signs and symptoms after administration to demonstrate safety and efficacy. This is really important since nitric oxide can\u2019t be measured in clinical labs like cholesterol or Vitamin D. Artificial intelligence is also quicker and more accurate in the analysis of other critical informatics. With the strain of manual labor gone, scientists and healthcare providers alike can focus on innovation.\u201d Intelligent Disease Detection And Diagnosis A recent study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute showed that the use of deep learning has been seen to achieve a breast cancer detection accuracy comparable to an average breast radiologist. At the end of the day, every scientific sector and indeed every sector in the diverse industries depend on data to run effectively. The ability to organize and classify data into forums and subforums and to predict purported implications is one of the greatest advantages of Artificial Intelligence. AI and IoT-powered wearables and appliances are another powerful way innovators are using AI to gather health data, in such a way that such data can be used to predict anomalies and early-stage diseases. Loss of nitric oxide is recognized as one of the earliest events in the onset and progression of every major chronic disease. Recognizing this prior to onset of symptoms is key to stopping the progression of disease. This will revolutionize health care and the costs associated with treating patients with advanced disease. The possibilities are seemingly endless . According to Google, In their latest research , a neural network can be trained to detect signs of lung cancer faster and easier than trained radiologists. Developers are also trying to develop robust AI-driven software that can spot signs of a certain disease accurately in medical images such as, X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. Bryan explains, \u201cIf we can eliminate mistakes in our approach and process, the world would be better for it. This is what I consider the greatest value AI brings. The ability to cross-reference the data of a patient against all other patients with similar diseases and to point out a single disimilarity can be the difference between losing a life and saving it. \u201d What Does The Future Hold? A lot of things have been touted. If algorithms can process all the information about our health, lifestyle, and the environment we live in, they can give suggestions on what to do to course-correct or to live healthier and hence make us live longer. AI systems can help us stay fit, it can lighten the workload for doctors, reduce the workload for researchers and simplify the decision-making process. Its greatest contribution would be the ability to understand the vast amounts of scientific data that we have garnered from millennia of study and treatment. It is truly an exciting road of possibilities if we clear all the hurdles. Bryan explains it well when he says; \u201cIf we can deal with obstacles like biased data, extreme commercialization of AI systems, there is no way this would not be the catalyst for explosive scientific discoveries and more importantly translation of these discoveries into safe and effective therapeutics in this decade and beyond\u201d As AI makes its journey from the periphery of sciences and healthcare to the mainstream, it seems that all we can do is marvel at the evolution and stand guard as well so that it doesn't become a double edged sword.",

This announcement is part of the company\u2019s measured roll out of cloud gaming services designed to bring PC Gaming to more devices and with better performance. While it\u2019s not as flexible as having your own dedicated game PC, there\u2019s a lot to be said for getting access to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU running on an AMD Threadripper Pro CPU for only US$99.99 for 6 months. That is really appealing if you want a higher refresh rate for competitive game performance and don\u2019t have the space or budget for an expensive game PC. We previously covered changes to the GFN pricing tiers earlier this year and explained the appeal of cloud gaming. MORE FROM FORBES Nvidia GeForce Now Game Streaming Service Updates Tiers By Kevin Krewell The GFN service offers games from many PC online stores, including Steam, Epic, GOG, and Ubisoft. The available titles on GFN include many of the popular free-to-play games like Fortnite, Dota 2, Apex Legends, Destiny 2 and more. With both Priority and RTX 3080 memberships there\u2019s support for ray tracing titles like New World, Marvel\u2019s Guardian of the Galaxy, Dying Light 2 and NARAKA: BLADEPOINT. EA has some limited titles on the GFN service such as Apex Legends, Battlefield 1 Revolution, Mirrors Edge Catalyst, Unravel and Dragon Age. Nvidia adds new games every Thursday. The GeForce Now Product Pricing and Feature Matrix Nvidia Nvidia is building out the new GFN service using a new more capable cloud gaming servers it calls GeForce NOW SuperPODs, using technology it developed for the high-performance computing market. MORE FOR YOU Black Google Product Manager Stopped By Security Because They Didn\u2019t Believe He Was An Employee Vendor Management Is The New Customer Management, And AI Is Transforming The Sector Already What Are The Ethical Boundaries Of Digital Life Forever? The GFN SuperPOD is bigger than the previous GFN cloud servers by about double. Each GFN SuperPOD supports over 1000 users with more than 1000 GPUs. The Nvidia Ampere-based GeForce RTX supports ray tracing graphics on titles that support Nvidia\u2019s RTX technology. In aggregate, Nvidia specifies the GFN SuperPOD delivers more than 39 petaflops in those 1000 GPUs and has 8,960 AMD Threadripper Pro CPU cores. With the SuperPOD each gamer has access to cloud hardware comprised of an 8-core/16-thread CPU, a dedicated GeForce RTX 3080, 28GB of DDR4-3200 RAM, and a PCIe Gen4 SSD. In a dig against consoles, Nvidia adds that for gamers the GFN SuperPOD allocates an instance and \u201cEach instance is 35 teraflops of performance, nearly 3x that of an Xbox Series X.\u201d Play GeForce Now on many platforms Nvidia With this level of performance Nvidia is targeting gamers running up to 1440p displays running at 120Hz. Nvidia\u2019s client software delivers a smooth frame rate to the client at either 60Hz or 120Hz. Nvidia can also support 60Hz refresh rates at 4K HDR resolution on Nvidia\u2019s Shield TV. For high-resolution, high-refresh configurations, Nvidia recommends that gamers have 35Mbps of network download bandwidth. As of October 21, GeForce Now Founders and Priority members have early access and can preorder GeForce NOW RTX 3080. Six-month memberships cost $99.99, and will be available in North America starting in November. In Europe, they\u2019ll be available in December. Preorders will also be open to all gamers later in October, pending availability. Quantities are limited. In addition, the company is expanding its GFN reach with game servers in Canada (Montreal), Russia (Siberia), South America, Singapore, and Australia. With the ongoing GPU shortage, GFN offers a good alternative to spending thousands on a new computer. You never know, new GPUs may just be around the corner in 2022.

Talyn Rose, 14, was nearly through the front gate of his Robina State High School on Friday morning when lightning hit a nearby pole and travelled through the ground to the point where he was standing. The shock went through Talyn\u2019s feet and up his body, appearing to exit his shoulder as it knocked him to the ground. \u201cI noticed when I hit the bitumen but that\u2019s about it,\u201d Tayln told Today. \u201cIt was a really \u2013 it felt like a really slow fall. Like I could take in most of my surroundings before I hit the floor.\u201d Talyn was taken to hospital with burn-like injuries, but was conscious and calm the whole time. His thick-soled rubber shoes were being credited with preventing further damage. Of the initial strike, Talyn said: \u201cEverything was numb. I couldn't feel anything. I couldn\u2019t feel any pain. It was all, like, painless, I guess.\u201d His father managed to provide a bit of levity once the initial shock passed. \u201cI know his dad when he saw him in hospital asked him why he didn't sidestep it,\u201d mum Michelle Nimmo told the Today show. Talyn\u2019s sister apparently joined in on the act. \u201cShe tries to plug her phone into me a few times but it doesn't work,\u201d he said.

    "full_description": "The Boeing Company is an American aerospace company that makes rockets, airplanes, satellites, missiles and other high-tech products. Since 2011, they have been involved in NASA's Commercial Crew Program (CCP) to provide a new vehicle that can ferry astronauts into space. Boeing was founded in 1916 by William Edward Boeing in Seattle, Washington, according to an informational video on the company's website. Boeing, who had made a fortune selling lumber, joined with engineer George Conrad Westervelt to build a new type of seaplane called the Boeing Model 1. Over the years, the company grew and produced airplanes for both military and commercial applications. During the 1960s Apollo program , Boeing worked with McDonnell Douglas and North American Aviation to build NASA's Saturn V rocket that took astronauts to the moon, according to the company . Boeing was also involved in the Space Shuttle program. The company famously manufactured a modified Boeing 747 that the orbiting shuttle vehicle would piggyback atop during tests and travel, according to Boeing . In 2006, Boeing created a joint venture with the private spaceflight company Lockheed Martin called United Launch Alliance (ULA) to provide rockets for both NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense. ULA has some of the largest launch vehicles around, which ferry supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) and are also used to propel probes to other planets in the solar system. As the Space Shuttle program wound down in 2011, NASA was looking for alternatives that could bring its crews into space. That year, the agency awarded four private companies \u2014 Blue Origin , Sierra Nevada, SpaceX and Boeing \u2014 contracts to stimulate the development of new vehicles capable of travelling to the ISS, with Boeing receiving the highest funding at the time with $92.3 million. Boeing had already been working on its Crew Space Transportation-100 (CST-100) spacecraft, a capsule that could fly on various rocket boosters including SpaceX and ULA's. The award allowed the company to continue to develop and mature the vehicle. Related: Starliner: Boeing's next-generation spaceship In 2014, NASA selected both SpaceX and Boeing as partners in its Commercial Crew Program. SpaceX has used its Crew Dragon spacecraft to ferry astronauts, while Boeing is continuing to work on its vehicle, now called the CST-100 Starliner. Starliner is a gumdrop-shaped capsule measuring 14.8 feet (4.5 meters) across at its widest point. It is designed to carry up to seven passengers, or a mix of cargo and crew, to low Earth orbit, according to Boeing . As of May 2020, NASA has given Boeing about $4.8 billion to develop Starliner. According to a report from the U.S. Office of the Inspector General, NASA will pay around $90 million per seat for each crewmember on Starliner, compared to just $55 million per seat for Dragon, though Boeing has stated that they \"strongly disagree\" with the report's conclusions regarding pricing. Boeing began its much-anticipated testing of Starliner in space in 2019, during a mission that was supposed to last eight days and feature an automated rendezvous with the ISS. An error with Starliner's onboard timing system prevented this plan from being enacted, and the capsule ended up circling the Earth on its own for 48 hours and then landing at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Boeing's Starliner has since suffered repeated delays due to issues with the vehicle's valves and as of late 2021, it is unclear when the capsule may carry astronauts.",

In August, the Biden Administration also highlighted that there are 500,000 open cybersecurity roles across the country. This talent gap is putting a strain on defenders and leaving most spread thin and their organizations vulnerable to destructive cyberattacks. CISOs [Chief Information Security Officer] and business leaders have an opportunity to learn from these attacks and take advantage of this moment in time to educate employees and stakeholders about the importance of cybersecurity. But they should also leverage this opportunity to acknowledge the burnout facing security professionals and ensure these defenders are supported and empowered. As part of my role, I have many conversations with CISOs and security leaders about the challenges they\u2019re currently facing. Many are concerned about how best to build resilient security teams that can manage the high stress that a career in cybersecurity brings. Here are four best practices for CISOs and security leaders working to break the burnout cycle: It is important to spot the early signs of burnout. There are telltale warning signs like disengagement and cynicism that can happen before outright exhaustion sets in. Create an open environment where employees can feel comfortable expressing that they are experiencing the symptoms of burnout without it being seen as a fault or weakness. Encourage and train your teams to use efficient processes and technology. There is too much to do in a day to waste any time on inefficiencies. At the same time, a company can invest all the money in the world on automation technology and tools but without proper training , it can create unnecessary complexity and confusion. Arming teams with the proper tools and training will allow for them to effectively do their jobs, leading to a decrease in stress. From my experience, cybersecurity professionals are extremely driven, tactical people. I find that often, they\u2019re so engrossed in what their work needs from them that they forget what they need from themselves. As a leader, it\u2019s important to urge your teams to take mental health days and PTO. Unplugging is crucial for people to reset and recharge, coming back feeling motivated and ready. Another idea would be to offer non-standard working hours based on the needs of your employees. Feeling respected and valued enough to create schedules that work for their lives leaves employees feeling in control and able to balance more. Zoom fatigue and too much screen time can leave people feeling drained at the end of the day. Switch your team\u2019s meetings to walking meetings, provide weekly mindfulness training, and encourage call-free Fridays. Remember as the leader, you should practice what you preach here and lead by example with these suggestions. It\u2019s time for security leaders to take a step back and not only examine their organization\u2019s security posture but also take inventory of whether employees are feeling supported and empowered. The future of cybersecurity depends on it.",

    "full_description": "It's amazing what a difference a\u2014well, a complete overhaul of everything under the hood makes. On Lenovo.com at this writing, a configuration of the IdeaPad Flex 5 Chromebook is $337.49 with a sad Intel Celeron CPU, sadder 4GB of memory, and saddest 32GB of eMMC flash storage. At Costco, our test unit is $549.99 with an 11th Generation Core i3 chip, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB NVMe solid-state drive, and it's one of the nicest Chromebooks we've encountered. (It was even nicer when Costco took $100 off as we started this review, but unfortunately the sale has ended.) Only a ho-hum display panel keeps it from a Editors' Choice recommendation; you still might want to leverage that price-club membership if that sale drops again. The Flex 5 is a convertible laptop with a 13.3-inch touch screen. We reviewed a model with a 10th Generation Core i3, half the RAM, and eMMC storage in July 2020 . While that one's aluminum lid and ABS plastic bottom were Graphite Gray, the new unit is a handsome dark shade called Abyss Blue. The screen bezels are medium-thin; there's just a bit of flex if you grasp their corners or mash the keyboard deck. This consumer convertible measures 0.67 by 12.2 by 8.4 inches and weighs 2.97 pounds, a sliver thicker but lighter than Lenovo's 13.3-inch business 2-in-1, the ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook (3.3 pounds). A few Chromebooks are lighter still thanks to magnesium alloy construction. (The Google Pixelbook Go clamshell weighs 2.3 pounds, and the 14-inch Asus Chromebook Flip C436 is 2.6.) A tiny sliding shutter blocks the webcam if you're concerned about online snoops. Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth are standard, as is the usual Chromebook perk of a 12-month Google One membership with 100GB of cloud storage plus SoundCloud Go and Stadia trials. The keyboard is backlit, though there's no fingerprint reader to skip typing passwords. On the laptop's left side are USB 3.2 Type-A and Type-C ports (the latter accommodating the AC adapter), as well as an audio jack and a microSD card slot... There's a second USB-C port at right, along with a power button, a volume rocker, and a security-cable lockdown notch... With no HDMI port on the chassis, you'll need a USB-C DisplayPort dongle to connect an external monitor. The full HD (1,920-by-1,080-pixel) display is rated at a modest 250 nits of brightness, leaving me tapping the Brightness Up key in hopes of a better view. White backgrounds don't pop, and colors, though rich enough, look soft. Contrast is good, though reflections from the touch panel block wide viewing angles. Like other Chromebooks, the Flex 5 offers a variety of \"looks like\" or faux resolutions if you think the native 1080p makes screen elements too small. The default is 1,536 by 864. A spec sheet on Lenovo's website mentions an OLED screen option, but I couldn't find a system with it for sale at this writing. Maxx Audio speakers flanking the keyboard produce surprisingly decent sound\u2014vocals seem a little muted, but audio isn't harsh or tinny even at top volume. The bass isn't very punchy, but you can distinguish overlapping tracks. The 720p webcam captures relatively sharp, slightly dim images with good color and minimal static. Following the standard Chromebook layout with top-row browser and system shortcuts and a search/menu key in place of Caps Lock, the keyboard has a snappy, tappy typing feel. The buttonless Mylar touchpad glides and taps smoothly but has a stiff, shallow click. For our benchmark charts, I compared the IdeaPad Flex 5 to four other Chromebooks. Two are convertibles, smaller and larger than the Lenovo respectively: the Intel Celeron-powered Acer Chromebook Spin 311 and the Core i3-based HP Chromebook x360 14c . Two are clamshells: the 13.3-inch Google Pixelbook Go, which has a low-power, 8th Generation Intel Core i5 CPU, and the 14-inch, business-focused Asus Chromebook CX9 . You can see their basic specs in the table below. We test Chromebooks with three overall performance benchmark suites: one Chrome OS, one Android, and one online. The first, Principled Technologies' CrXPRT 2, measures how quickly a system performs everyday tasks in six workloads such as applying photo effects, graphing a stock portfolio, analyzing DNA sequences, and generating 3D shapes using WebGL. The second, UL's PCMark for Android Work 3.0, performs assorted productivity operations in a smartphone-style window. Finally, Basemark Web 3.0 runs in a browser tab to combine low-level JavaScript calculations with CSS and WebGL content. All three yield numeric scores; higher numbers are better. (See more about how we test laptops .) The Lenovo's Core i3-1115G4 processor has only two cores instead of four or more, but it proved quite perky. Opening multiple tabs and playing videos didn't faze it. It was second only to the 11th Gen Core i5 Asus in CrXPRT 2 and PCMark for Android, and it took the gold medal in Basemark Web (though all the contenders, except the lowly, Celeron-based Spin 311, acquitted themselves ably). Two other Android benchmarks focus on the CPU and GPU respectively. Primate Labs' Geekbench uses all available cores and threads to simulate real-world applications ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning, while GFXBench 5.0 stress-tests both low-level routines like texturing and high-level, game-like image rendering that exercises graphics and compute shaders. Geekbench delivers a numeric score, while GFXBench counts frames per second (fps). Finally, to test a Chromebook's battery life, we loop a 720p video file with screen brightness set at 50%, audio volume at 100%, and Wi-Fi and keyboard backlighting disabled until the system quits. If there isn't enough internal storage to hold the video, we play it from an external SSD plugged into a USB port. The IdeaPad performed nimbly in our CPU test and downright surprised us in GFXBench, showing suitability for casual gaming despite relying on Intel's traditionally unimpressive UHD integrated graphics. (We expected the Asus CX9 to win, but it balked at the benchmark.) It showed enough battery stamina to get through a full day of work or school, though nine and a quarter hours isn't a top-tier result by today's standards\u201411 or 12 hours would have been preferable. It doesn't come with a stylus as some convertibles do, but the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 Chromebook is an appealing touch-screen 2-in-1, with above-average performance and a comfortable keyboard. A brighter display and an HDMI port would make it an Editors' Choice award winner. Even as is, though, it deserves a spot on your list of Chromebooks worth checking out\u2014and if Costco ever repeats its $449.99 sale, snap it up.",

    "full_description": "Mark Zuckerberg is sick and tired of all the harm caused to Facebook. Yes, you read that correctly. At the top of his company's third quarter earnings call , the Facebook CEO broadly railed against the 17 news organizations working together to report on a massive trove of leaked internal documents dubbed the Facebook Papers . The problem, as Zuckerberg described it, is not the multiple terrors revealed by the reporting, but rather the media witch hunt targeting his well meaning trillion-dollar company. \"Good faith criticism helps us get better,\" huffed the clearly indignant Zuckerberg, \"but my view is that what we are seeing is a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company.\" Facebook has tried, and failed, to use this line of attack before to discredit reporting it views as unfavorable. On Oct. 18, the company's PR team was roundly mocked for railing against media outlets agreeing to an embargo \u2014 a standard journalist practice that Facebook itself routinely asks of reporters. But past failure didn't stop Zuckerberg from trying the approach once more. With his broadside against the vast media conspiracy out of the way, Zuckerberg then pivoted to conflating the fact that Facebook does internal research \u2014 the very research leaked by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen \u2014 with taking meaningful action on the findings of that research. \"The reality is that we have an open culture where we encourage discussion and research about our work so we can make progress on many complex issues that are not specific to just us,\" he dissembled. \"We have industry-leading programs to study the effects of our products and provide transparency to our progress.\" Notably, we know that Facebook-employed researchers tried time and time again to get Facebook leadership to act on their findings \u2014 often to little or no avail . Oh, and seemingly for good measure, Zuckerberg also took a moment to let everyone listening know that this polarization thing has little if anything to do with him personally. \"Polarization started rising in the U.S. before I was born,\" he stressed in a definitely not-protesting-too-much kind of way. In the end, the CEO wanted any and all haters to understand that no coordinated effort is going to slow him down. SEE ALSO: 5 damning revelations from the Facebook Papers \"We can't change the underlying media dynamic, but there is a different constituency that we serve that has always been more important and that I try to keep in focus,\" he said before pausing dramatically, \"and that's people.\" That's right, insisted Zuckerberg, Facebook cares about people \u2014 his own company's documents to the contrary be damned .",

    "description": "Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.",
    "content": "To get a roundup of TechCrunch\u2019s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, subscribe here. Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 25, 2021. What a day. We kicked off with news that a major, multibillion-dollar tech deal was kaput and closed out the trading day on news that another tech firm had reached the trillion-dollar market cap threshold. Facebook also reported earnings right after the bell, and TechCrunch dropped a host of hardware reviews. Tired yet? It\u2019s Monday. \u2013 Alex P.S. Our SaaS event is in two days; get hype. Announcing the final agenda for TechCrunch Sessions: SaaS 2021 The TechCrunch Top 3 PayPal calls off Pinterest deal: So much for the fintech-social media tie-up of the decade. U.S. fintech giant PayPal has killed off its potential buy of Pinterest. Shares of PayPal rose. Shares of Pinterest cratered. I suppose our general skepticism of the deal wasn\u2019t too far off the market. Tesla reaches $1T market cap: You may have missed it, but Tesla is now worth more than Facebook these days, cresting the $1 billion market cap market today during regular trading, while the social network closed the day worth a few dozen billion less. What drove Tesla\u2019s gains? Hertz, amazingly enough. Facebook misses revenue expectations, promises reporting changes: After the bell today, Facebook reported its Q3 2021 earnings, including a revenue miss, a per-share profit beat, and news that it intends to break out its AR and VR revenues into a separate category from here on out. The latter is good news, though we\u2019d appreciate more granular financial reporting from across the Empire of Zuck now that we know the company is capable of it. Shares of Facebook are up slightly, if still underwater from their Friday declines that came in the wake of Snap\u2019s Q3 report. Startups/VC Before we get truly underway with all of our startup coverage, we have a new item from Unicorn Land: New York tech company Braze is going public. While it was not a unicorn when it last raised capital, the company will nearly certainly crash through the $1 billion valuation mark when it debuts on the public markets. All hail our commercial space future: A consortium of firms are coming together to build a commercial space station. Given how rapidly the ISS is showing its age, this is a good thing. Sierra Space announced that \u201cBlue Origin and Boeing would be joining the team to send the [private space station] to orbit in the second half of the decade.\u201d We are closer and closer to our Bond-villain future that we\u2019ve all long awaited. Selfbook raises capital, pivots to business focus: The pandemic shook up quite a lot. Where we work. How we socialize. For hotel-booking company Selfbook, it shook up its business model. Now working for other companies, Selfbook \u201cclaims that its software gives hotels a way to accept \u2018one-click\u2019 payments directly on their websites while eliminating fraud and reducing chargebacks.\u201d The startup is now worth $125 million. Cameo books acquisition: The celebrity-booking service Cameo has proven to have a popular model. You can pay a fee and have a celebrity or other notable figure record a message for you. I once got one from an Eagles player that a friend commissioned for me. Fun times. Anyhoo, the company has made its first acquisition, picking up Represent, which TechCrunch describes as \u201ca marketing and merch company that helps celebrities and brands set up individualized online storefronts.\u201d You can see the synergies, obviously. Are all the startup names taken? Here at TechCrunch, we joke that there are too many venture capital firms, so much so that they are starting to double-up on names. For Example, Shine Capital and Shine Capital. Regardless, a startup called Y42 has raised funds, showing the world how to avoid using someone else\u2019s name. The Berlin-based startup has built a low-code data platform and just raised a $31 million Series A. Even more money to roll-up e-commerce brands: The race to buy e-commerce sellers continues this week with Boston-based Thrasio raising $1 billion more for its efforts. The company is now worth $10 billion. That\u2019s a lot of money. Per TechCrunch, the company is buying more than a brand each week, and has 200 in its portfolio. Wild. New task app aims to tell you what you\u2019re supposed to be doing right now: Meet Routine, a new startup working on a productivity tool that should help you manage your work day more efficiently. It\u2019s a brand new take on to-do lists as it combines both tasks, non-actionable notes and a daily planner. Fintech\u2019s growing role in the healthcare revolution Health care spending accounts for almost 18% of U.S. GDP, so it\u2019s no surprise that digital health is attracting record levels of investment.

    "full_description": "A seven-metre high wall erected to protect beachside mansions from being washed away has sparked debate among locals in a wealthy Sydney suburb. Five years ago, residents along Collaroy Beach watched helplessly as enormous waves smashed into their backyards , collapsing pools and patios of their multimillion-dollar waterfront properties. Two further storms have hit the beach since 2016. In response, homeowners along the most exposed strip have come together to finance a massive sea wall, with 10 residents each forking out $300,000 for the construction of the sheer concrete structure, designed and built by Horton Coastal Engineering. Other sections of the wall will have to be approved and financed separately by each affected group of residents \u2013 divided into roughly six groups \u2013 with the NSW government agreeing to chip in 20 per cent of the cost and residents paying 80 per cent. When complete, the wall will stretch for 1.3km from Collaroy to South Narrabeen. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t want to build a wall,\u201d resident Bob Orth told The Guardian on Sunday . \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to put up $300,000. But we had to build a wall and we\u2019ve done it strictly by the book. Without the wall built here, we\u2019d be ripped into with the next storm. I haven\u2019t got a doubt in the world [that it will work], and no one has any doubts along here. The owners are very happy with the solution.\u201d But other residents are not happy. Brendan Donohoe from the Surfrider Foundation environmental group, which has been fighting against the construction of a seawall for three decades, told The Guardian that the council was sacrificing the beach to protect private property. He feared the artificial structure would interrupt the natural, dynamic processes of sand movement, which could also drive erosion. \u201cUltimately these properties are probably unprotectable,\u201d he said. \u201cOur beach is the thing we should be trying to insure \u2013 not in the monetary sense but in the sense of its continued existence.\u201d Coastal engineer Angus Gordon described it as a \u201cbrutal engineering solution\u201d and argued a rock revetment would have been more fitting. But the Northern Beaches Council rejected the criticism, telling the outlet that the design had been reviewed by a Danish coastal engineer, the Manly Hydraulics Laboratory and a team from the University of NSW.

We've even gone ahead and listed the individual GameStop PS5 restock store locations and times below, so you don't have to use the janky GameStop zip code finder system.</p> <div class=\"product star-deal\"><p>\u25ba <strong>When? </strong><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/mattswider\" data-dimension112=\"6510e113-1148-47c7-b065-133b5e455a05\" data-action=\"Star Deal Block\" data-label=\"When?

Only buy from the US stores Matt alerts you about. No one will sell a PS5 for just $550.</p></div> <p>Matt has been tracking PS5 restock dates in the US, consistently sending out Twitter alerts when the Sony console is in stock. These alerts have become crucial for finding the PS5 in stock, as it usually lasts just a few minutes, or even seconds, during a restock. </p><p>This is the third GameStop PS5 restock in-store event in 2021, so stores selling the console is extremely rare. In fact, it's not a nationwide restock and GameStop hasn't repeated cities, so this has kind of been one long restock. </p><p>The previous GameStop restock was last Friday, hitting seven cities on Friday, October 22: Los Angeles, Phoenix, Houston, San Antonio, Miami-Ft. Lauderdale, Chicago or Boston. During the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/live/gamestop-ps5-restock-live-blog\">PS5 restock in Boston</a>, we did a live blog. </p><p>One month before that, on Thursday, September 30, the first GameStop in-store restock of 2021 happened in New York City, Atlanta and Dallas and their surrounding store locations.</p> <div class=\"product star-deal\"><div><span class=\"product__star-deal-label\">How to buy a PS5 restock</span><p>\u25ba <strong>Get crucial PS5 Black Friday emails:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.getrevue.co/profile/mattswider\" data-dimension112=\"4b337bbb-63f2-4ee4-b69d-6a88b98494cf\" data-action=\"Star Deal Block\" data-label=\"Sign up for Matt's Monday newsletter\" data-dimension48=\"Sign up for Matt's Monday newsletter\"><strong>Sign up for Matt's Monday newsletter</strong></a> to find out how to get links to hard-to-find tech during Black Friday 2021.</p></div></div> <p>We've listed all of the city locations of the GameStop PS5 restock coming this Friday.

    "full_description": "There's another GameStop PS5 restock in-store event in the US, and the official date is Friday, October 29. This is your chance to buy the Sony PlayStation 5 console, if you live in one of the six cities where the in-store restock is taking place. Where? When? Follow our PS5 and Twitter tracker Matt Swider \u2013 follow and turn on notifications \u2013 and you'll get crucial alerts of when and where to find the Sony PS in stock at all stores in America. This week, it's GameStop stores in Seattle, San Francisco, Nashville, Raleigh, Detroit and Philadelphia (and also Southern New Jersey). We've even gone ahead and listed the individual GameStop PS5 restock store locations and times below, so you don't have to use the janky GameStop zip code finder system. \u25ba When? Follow our PS5 restock Twitter tracker Matt Swider and turn on notifications for instant restock news. It's the fastest way to get PS5 and Xbox stock updates. \u25ba Never buy from other Twitter users \u2013 ever. They're all scams. Only buy from the US stores Matt alerts you about. No one will sell a PS5 for just $550. Matt has been tracking PS5 restock dates in the US, consistently sending out Twitter alerts when the Sony console is in stock. These alerts have become crucial for finding the PS5 in stock, as it usually lasts just a few minutes, or even seconds, during a restock. This is the third GameStop PS5 restock in-store event in 2021, so stores selling the console is extremely rare. In fact, it's not a nationwide restock and GameStop hasn't repeated cities, so this has kind of been one long restock. The previous GameStop restock was last Friday, hitting seven cities on Friday, October 22: Los Angeles, Phoenix, Houston, San Antonio, Miami-Ft. Lauderdale, Chicago or Boston. During the PS5 restock in Boston , we did a live blog. One month before that, on Thursday, September 30, the first GameStop in-store restock of 2021 happened in New York City, Atlanta and Dallas and their surrounding store locations. \u25ba Get crucial PS5 Black Friday emails: Sign up for Matt's Monday newsletter to find out how to get links to hard-to-find tech during Black Friday 2021. We've listed all of the city locations of the GameStop PS5 restock coming this Friday. Follow Matt for individual store updates now: GameStop is once again listing the cities where the PS5 restock will take place, and it has a GameStop store search function . But we've found that to be problematic, especially if you don't know the exact zip code of the GameStop stores across town. So we've listed all 290 GameStop stores (below) , so you can search among the seven cities to find out where it'll be in stock. Before we get to the GameStop PS5 restock store list, let's go over when the times when your local GameStop store will open to sell you a PS5. Generally, stores stick to their usual opening times, so if your local GameStop opens at 8am EDT, as a few of them do in major cities, that's when you can expect the store managers to hand out paper tickets for PS5 bundles. However, some stores open at later times, including 10am, 11am, and 12pm, and oftentimes, GameStop locations within malls are not a part of the restock dates due to a ban on camping out in front of private malls locations. Matt Swider will be in Philadelphia to live blog the line situation at one of the stores where PS5 is in stock. That's why we're listing these stores first among the six cities scheduled to get the PlayStation 5.

    "description": "A drive to spend the European Union\u2019s massive \u20ac750 billion Covid-19 stimulus fund quickly carries risks of fraud and waste, Ireland\u2019s member of the European Court of Auditors has said. Backed by joint borrowing, the Next Generation EU funds are made up of \u20ac390 billion in grants and the remainder in cheap loans, doled out to member states to be spent on investments and reforms to reach climate and digitalisation targets. Some countries are to receive large amounts under the scheme, which is apportioned according to underlying economic strength and the impact of the pandemic. Italy is set for some \u20ac191.5 billion in a mix of grants and loans, while Ireland is one of the smallest recipients, in line for almost \u20ac1 billion in grants. \u201cObviously where money is being put out quicker, normally you would say the risk of fraud is inherently higher,\u201d Ireland\u2019s member of the body, Tony Murphy, said. \u201cThe emphasis is to get this money out quickly . . . which obviously can provide opportunities. But I think for us the other risk is that we would get projects which are not the best quality,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s a risk I would definitely see, that there\u2019s so much money to be absorbed in a very short period of time, that there could be pressure on just to spend it on anything, whether it\u2019s really providing a lot of added value or not.\u201d Scrutiny of expenditure While some details of how the spending will be scrutinised are still being worked out, payment of the funds will be linked to the achievement of targets rather than on a cost-reimbursement system. This means that auditors may have less oversight over the spending of the funds, Mr Murphy said. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about cost reimbursements anymore, we\u2019re talking about milestones being met for reforms or investment targets being met. It\u2019s a completely different field,\u201d he said. For example, a project to buy 1,000 computers for a school would only need to demonstrate that this had been done, and not show the invoice for how much the computers cost and where they were bought, he said. \u201cAt least as far as we understand today, costs are irrelevant for us, which would mean things like procurement, all of these issues, wouldn\u2019t be part of our audit scope.\u201d In addition, if the money is paid into the general accounts of member states and becomes mixed with ordinary national funds, the EU could lose oversight of how they are spent. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a different funding mechanism, there are still open-ended questions about \u2013 is it member state money? And if it goes into the overall pool, it\u2019s not easy to follow,\u201d Mr Murphy said. Net contribution According to the Court of Auditors annual report, Ireland was a net contributor to the European Union\u2019s budget in 2020, continuing a shift in recent years after decades of receiving more on balance from the union than it put in. The net contribution in 2020 was \u20ac360 million, compared to \u20ac229 million in 2019 and \u20ac541 million in 2018, though this calculation does not include benefits such as the economic impact of single market membership. Total EU expenditure in 2020 was \u20ac173.3 billion, according to new figures by the European Court of Auditors, which represents just over \u20ac385 for each EU citizen or 1.1 per cent of the EU\u2019s overall gross national income. For the second year running, the auditors produced an adverse opinion on legality and regularity of expenditure in the EU, due to an estimated rate of errors of 4 per cent in areas of high-risk expenditure. An error means that money is paid out not in accordance with EU or national rules, but does not necessarily mean deliberate wrongdoing or fraud has taken place.",

    "full_description": "On Jan. 9, 2020, NASA astronaut Christina Koch celebrated her 300th day in space aboard the International Space Station (ISS). By the time she landed back on Earth on Feb. 6, she had broken the record for the longest time spent in space by a woman. That's not the only historic achievement for the astronaut. Just a few months prior, Koch and another woman astronaut, Jessica Meir, completed the first all-woman spacewalk . The spacewalk made \"sure that NASA was really committed to, like I like to say, answering humanity's call to explore by everyone,\" Koch told Space.com a year after the momentous event. \"And so it was just a wonderful thing to have the honor to participate in. And I think that we're just so appreciative still to receive the support that we still receive every day about it,\" she said. Related: Women in space \u2014 A Gallery of firsts Koch was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan and grew up in Jacksonville, North Carolina. From a young age, she wanted to be an astronaut, and joined her middle school's \"Rocket Club.\" Trips to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida only solidified that dream, she told Jon Evans on his podcast . Koch attended North Carolina State University in Raleigh and completed a bachelor's in electrical engineering as well as a bachelor's in physics. She then completed a Master's in electrical engineering. After completing her degrees, Koch joined NASA as an electrical engineer at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Maryland. While at GSFC, Koch worked in the Laboratory for High Energy Astrophysics on instruments for several space science missions. After her time at GSFC, Koch worked in Antarctica at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station and Palmer Station. From there, she returned to her electrical engineering roots and worked at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, contributing to instruments on the Juno spacecraft and Van Allen probes. In 2013, Koch was selected as a member of NASA's 21st astronaut class. After six years of intense training, she launched on her first space mission to the ISS on March 14, 2019 from Baikonur Cosmodrome on a Soyuz spacecraft . She was joined by astronaut Nick Hague and Russian Cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin. Related: How to become an astronaut In her tenure on the ISS, Koch served as a flight engineer on expeditions 59, 60 and 61. While aboard the ISS, Koch worked on several scientific studies that covered human biology, Earth science, technology development and more. She also completed three all-woman spacewalks out of her six total spacewalks , spending a total of 42 hours and 15 minutes in the vacuum of space. Oct. 18, 2019, wasn't originally supposed to be a historic day. The first woman spacewalk was supposed to occur on March 29th, but an issue with space suit sizes delayed that plan. NASA's space suits are a marvel of engineering \u2014 they're essentially tiny, human-shaped spaceships. The most important part of the spacesuit is a hard plastic torso piece that holds the electronics that control all the suit's systems. An ill-fitted spacesuit can lead to serious safety issues, and reconfiguring the suit can take up to 12 hours. Koch and her colleague Anne McClain were scheduled to participate in a spacewalk together, but there was only one spacesuit made to fit McClain or Koch, so McClain swapped places with her colleague Nick Hauge so that Koch could wear the one spacesuit that fit both women. Related: Astronauts won't make the 1st all female spacewalk afterall By October, the crew had reconfigured another suit to fit Jessica Mier, who then joined Koch on the first all-woman spacewalk . For more than seven hours, the pair worked on replacing a battery charge/discharge unit that failed to activate after new lithium ion batteries were installed. Koch returned to Earth on Feb. 6, 2020, after having spent 328 days in space, setting the record for the longest space mission by a woman . She returned just as the Covid-19 pandemic was beginning and Americans were preparing for the possibility of a wide-spread quarantine. But coming back to a world on the cusp of a pandemic didn't feel as isolating it could have for Koch, she told Boston's WBUR radio. \"You know, being under stay-at-home orders really for me has actually offered a lot more than the isolation that I experienced for 11 months on board the International Space Station \u2026 it's allowed me to really get comfortable with my home life, to reintegrate in my home and in my neighborhood,\" she said. Related: NASA astronaut Christina Koch reflects on 1-year anniversary of first all-woman spacewalk Space travel has traditionally been designed for men. The physical embodiment of that fact is NASA's space suits, which had been designed with a man's physique in mind, not a woman's. Koch's participation in the first all-woman spacewalk was a ground-breaking accomplishment for female astronauts and all non-male people around the world, alike. \"Men's physiology, perspectives, values, measurements, comfort and ambitions have mostly been the default template for designing major human endeavors. I believe that Koch and Meir, by their sheer skill and execution, shift us closer to a template based on intelligence, agility, capability, integrity, courage and excellence,\" Mae Jemison, a fellow female astronaut, wrote about the pair in Time magazine's \"The 100 most Influential People of the Year\" feature . In December 2020, Koch was selected as one of the astronauts who will journey to the Moon on NASA's Artemis missions . That means she could be one of the first \u2014 if not the first \u2014 woman to step foot on the moon. \"To me, what [Artemis] really represents is that NASA is committed to answering humanity's call to explore by all and for all. We're an example of how you're most successful when you take contributions from every single part of the world, and the planet and humanity,\" Koch told Raleigh, North Carolina's CBS17 about the selection.",

    "full_description": "Geno Smith isn't exactly getting an easy time of it on his return to NFL action. First the Rams, then the Steelers, and now a well-rested Saints team coming off a bye week. Read on as we explain how to get a Saints vs Seahawks live stream and watch NFL Monday Night Football online no matter where you are today. Date: Monday, October 25 Time: 8.15pm ET / 5.15pm PT / 1.15am BST / 11.15am AEDT Venue: Lumen Field, Seattle, Washington TV channel and live stream: ESPN ( via Sling TV discount or free fuboTV trial ) | Sky Sports (UK) Free live stream: DAZN FREE trial (CA) | Kayo Sports FREE trial (AU) Watch anywhere: try the world' s no.1 VPN 100% risk-free The Saints boast one of the meanest rush defenses in the league, but they're not so smart when the ball's in the air. Smith threw for a touchdown and 131 yards against the Rams and a touchdown and 209 yards against the Steelers, but his fumble in overtime proved costly last weekend. However, with Jameis Winston on the field, whatever Smith does might not matter. You never know if you're going to get five touchdowns or zilch from the Saints center, who has more than lived up to his reputation so far this season. But when things are going badly, there's always Alvin Kamara to step up to the plate, and Seattle's defense is a hot mess.

    "full_description": "SAN FRANCISCO: Facebook announced over $9 billion in quarterly profits on Monday, hours after a US news collective published a deluge of withering reports arguing the company prioritizes its growth over people's safety. The social media giant has been battling a fresh crisis since former employee Frances Haugen leaked reams of internal studies showing executives knew of their sites' potential for harm, prompting a renewed US push for regulation. Facebook released results showing its profit in the recently-ended quarter grew to over $9 billion -- a 17% increase -- and its ranks of users increased to 2.91 billion. Hours earlier, new reports blamed CEO Mark Zuckerberg for his platform bending to state censors in Vietnam, noted Facebook allowed hate speech to flourish internationally due to linguistic shortcomings and said it knew its algorithm fueled toxic polarization online. \"These damning documents underscore that Facebook leadership chronically ignored serious internal alarms, choosing to put profits over people,\" US Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Big Tech critic, said in a statement. News organizations like , and Wired were among those that have now received access to the set of internal Facebook documents that Haugen originally leaked to US authorities and which were the basis of a damning series. Facebook has assailed the reporting as the selective publication of some of its mountain of internal studies, aimed at casting the social network used by billions of people in a dark and inaccurate light. Haugen, who testified on social media before UK lawmakers Monday, has repeatedly said the company puts its continuous growth and thus profits before the well-being and safety of users. \"Facebook has been unwilling to accept even little slivers of profit being sacrificed for safety, and that's not acceptable,\" she told the lawmakers, adding that angry or hate-fuelled content \"is the easiest way to grow\" the social media platform. Facebook has been hit by major crises previously, but the current view behind the curtain of the insular company has fueled a frenzy of scathing reports and a renewed push from US lawmakers to crack down on social media. story out on Monday said Zuckerberg had personally signed off on a push from Vietnam's authoritarian government to limit the spread of so-called \"anti-state\" posts. A report from Politico called the documents a \"treasure trove for Washington's anti-trust fight\" against the platform, revealing internal employee chats about Facebook global dominance. One of Monday's reports, from website , plunged into the company's own worries for its future. \"Teenage users of the Facebook app in the US had declined by 13% since 2019 and were projected to drop 45 percent over the next two years, driving an overall decline in daily users in the company's most lucrative ad market,\" the story said, citing internal company research. The company has bounced back from other scandals like the one involving Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm that used the personal data of millions of Facebook users to target political ads. In that case, Zuckerberg went to Washington to apologize and the company agreed to a $5 billion settlement with US regulators.",

    "full_description": "Facebook employees say Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s obsession with growth has overridden ethical concerns and allowed hate speech and incitements to violence to spread unchecked, internal messages leaked to media outlets show. \u201cHistory will not judge us kindly,\u201d one staffer reportedly wrote on the day of the January 6 Capitol riots, which were organised partially through Facebook. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fuelling this fire for a long time and we shouldn\u2019t be surprised it\u2019s now out of control,\u201d wrote another Facebook staffer, according to the Atlantic. Facebook employees who had spent months raising concerns about the social media company\u2019s engagement-obsessed algorithms pushing users toward extreme and conspiratorial content felt betrayed by a lack of action from the company, according to the report. In August 2020, one employee working on Facebook\u2019s \u201cintegrity\u201d team griped that any proposed design changes that would reduce users\u2019 exposure to extreme content like the QAnon conspiracy theory had been consistently sidelined in favour of increasing user engagement. The employee accused the company of being \u201cwilling to act only after things had spiralled into a dire state,\u201d according to the Atlantic. \u201cPersonally, during the time that we hesitated, I\u2019ve seen folks from my hometown go further and further down the rabbithole of QAnon and Covid anti-mask/anti-vax conspiracy on FB,\u201d the employee added. \u201cIt has been painful to observe.\u201d Other Facebook employees, meanwhile, accused Zuckerberg of personally intervening to protect political figures who violated the company\u2019s content moderation rules, according to the Financial Times. In one such case in 2019, Facebook moderators took down a video that falsely said that abortions are \u201cnever medically necessary\u201d. After Republican politicians including Texas Senator Ted Cruz complained about the move, Zuckerberg was personally involved with Facebook\u2019s decision to put the video back up, according to the outlet. Zuckerberg also allegedly gave into the Vietnam government\u2019s censorship demands last year to avoid losing an estimated $1 billion in annual revenue from the country, insiders told the Washington Post. Ahead of an election in Vietnam last year, Zuckerberg personally decided to censor Facebook posts from anti-government pages because he argued going offline in the country would do more harm to free speech, the outlet said. Between July and December last year, Facebook took down more than 2200 posts by Vietnamese users \u2014 compared to just 834 in the first six months of 2020. Many Facebook employees also reportedly believe the company unfairly makes exceptions to its false news policy when dealing with certain publishers. Moves to remove \u201crepeat offenders\u201d from Facebook were dropped after being \u201cinfluenced by input from Public Policy\u201d an employee said in a December 2020 memo reported by the Financial Times, in reference to Facebook\u2019s powerful Washington, DC-based arm led by former Bush administration staffer Joel Kaplan. In particular, Facebook gives special treatment to conservative publishers including Breitbart, Diamond and Silk, Charlie Kirk and PragerU, the employee said. Facebook did not immediately reply to requests for comment on the Atlantic and Financial Times reports. Company spokesman Joe Osborne told the Financial Times: \u201cAt the heart of these stories is a premise which is false. Yes, we\u2019re a business and we make profit, but the idea that we do so at the expense of people\u2019s safety or wellbeing misunderstands where our own commercial interests lie. The truth is we\u2019ve invested $13bn and have over 40,000 people to do one job: keep people safe on Facebook.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s articles, which come on the same day Facebook is set to report third-quarter earnings, are part of a larger series of news stories based on documents leaked under embargo by whistleblower Frances Haugen. Other documents leaked by Haugen reportedly show that Facebook has allegedly misled investors and masked slowing growth among critical demographics like young users in the US, as well as failed to crack down on human trafficking on the site. Facebook shares were trading up 0.4 per cent at $325.75 (USD) on Tuesday \u2014 but have tanked more than 15 per cent since the beginning of September as Haugen has shared internal company documents with reporters and called on lawmakers to regulate the tech giant. \u2014 New York Post Children as young as 13 have been caught plotting horrific attacks on Australian soil over the internet. The Morrison government has unveiled proposed legislation aimed at protecting teens from the harmful effects of social media. In a move that defies belief, an anti-vaxxer is hocking prosthetic arms for $1500 on Facebook to sidestep getting the jab.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Updated Monday 25th October; article originally posted 23rd October. Are Apple \u2019s new MacBook Pro really your best choice for a macOS laptop, or does have Tim Cook and his team have something better? MacBook Pro, late 2021. Apple Newsroom Update: Monday 25th October: Last week\u2019s MacBook Pro is not the only new macBook laptop under development. With a new MacBook Air expected early next year, there\u2019s a lot to consider, especially when you look at the specs Apple will be offering. The details on the new hardware come from noted Apple watcher DylanDK on Twitter : \"The upcoming MacBook (Air) will release in the middle of 2022. It will have MagSafe, a 1080p webcam, USB C ports, a 30W power adapter, and no fans. There will be color options similar to the iMac 24. The bezels and keyboard will be an off white with full sized function keys.\" While these details don\u2019t quite match up to the advertised features on the new MacBook Pro laptops announced last week, there are some important points to note. The first is that the Touch Bar is definitely being scrubbed from the MacBook platform. With the return to function keys, the MacBook Air keyboard is, like the MacBook Pro, returning to the 2015 layout.

Maybe the same will be true of the MacBook Air. Finally we have the note on the color, with the MacBook Air set to follow the pastel shades of the iMac, which in turn echoed the vibrant colors of the iBook. Of course there\u2019s one other design cue that\u2019s going to make it over, and Jon Prosser, along with RendersByIan , has the concept imagery showing the full awkward glory of a MacBook Air with a notched screen. MacBook Air 2022 concept image featuring notched screen. Front Page Tech and RendersByIan While the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro designs certainly update the macOS platform, Apple has focused on creating a machine better suited for professionals needing power and flexibility - the \u201cPro\u201d moniker feels relevant again. More than ever, these high-end laptops are not for everyone. Put aside the \u201cnew and shiny\u201d thoughts and you\u2019ll find some better choices in Apple\u2019s portfolio for an all-rounder macOS laptop. First up is the price. The entry level 14-inch MacBook Pro comes in at $1999 plus tax for the model with 16 GB RAM and 512 GB storage. As always you can bump up both the processor speed and the processor architecture (from the M1 Pro to the M1 Max), the available memory, and available storage. Max out all your options and you are looking at $5,899 with M1 Max and 32-core GPU, 64 GB of RAM and 8 TB of storage. Keep that in mind, because these MacBook Pro laptops are very much targeted towards users who need an excess of power - media professionals and developers being two of the markets. They are going to look at those base specs and think \u201cnope, I need more\u201d. If you\u2019re looking at those specs and thinking they are more than enough for the job you want, then perhaps the new MacBook Pro hardware is simply overpowered. The current M1 powered MacBook Air, with 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage comes in at $1,399. Is the extra inch of screen and spare headroom in the processor worth $600? You also should think about the future of the MacBook Air. Information from the supply chain suggests that the new design and technology in the MacBook Pro - most notably the miniLED screen with the curious choice of a notch - is destined for next year\u2019s MacBook Air. Given Apple\u2019s historic trend of keeping the 'first\u2019 MacBook in the portfolio at $999, I\u2019d expect the next Air, with all the design benefits (and the notch) in the MacBook Pro to match that price. Don't forget just how accomplished the M1 powered MacBook Air has been. It has been more than enough for an army of early adopters, even in the entry level 8 GB RAM 256 GB storage version. Now take that, add in the new features on show in the MacBook Pro, and\u2019ve got yourself a combination that feels perfectly suited for the consumer market. Finally, on a more practical front, the new MacBook Pro laptops are already listed as being on backorder (ie out of stock) for up to six weeks. You already have a built in buffer to take your time and carefully consider if the new MacBook Pro laptops are right for you. If you don\u2019t need the excessive levels of power, if you are looking for a more affordable MacBook laptop, and if you need a new MacBook right now, the MacBook Pro is not for you. Whether you go with the current MacBook Air, or wait to see just how much of the new technology and design shows up in the next-generation Air, the answer is not always to go for a Pro. Now read about the MacBook Pro\u2019s stramash over SD card, HDMI ports, and fast chargers...",

    "description": "This is multimedia. | The new MateBook 16 from Huawei is a powerful multimedia notebook that is particularly impressive thanks to its fast AMD Ryzen processor and high-resolution display. This device offers more CPU performance than most mobile workstations.",
    "content": null,
    "pubDate": "2021-10-25 21:21:00",
    "full_description": "The new MateBook 16 is Huawei's newest addition to its lineup of high-quality multimedia laptops in the style of the MateBook X Pro or the new MateBook 14s . It has recently been launched in Europe for a starting price of 1100 Euro (~1300 USD), which positions it above the old MateBook D16 , which was available from around 850 Euro. The new MateBook 16 is directed at customers that are looking for a powerful device with a large display but who do not require a dedicated GPU for gaming. We have reviewed the more powerful configuration equipped with the new AMD Ryzen 7 5800H including a Radeon RX Vega 8 iGPU, 16 GB of RAM, a 512 GB PCIe SSD and a high-resolution 16-inch 3:2 IPS display for 1200 Euro. The competitors include the MateBook D 16 mentioned above, the Acer Swift 3 16 , the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Pro 16 , the Schenker Vision 15 and the Dell XPS 15 9510 . The MateBook 16's new aluminum case is equal to the MateBook X Pro or the new MateBook 14s in terms of quality and gives a better impression than the older MateBook D16 . The device has a very high-quality feel to it and the workmanship appears to be perfect. Its design is similar to that of the other MateBooks and includes a small hollow to open the display cover and a polished edge on the top of the base unit. The only color available on this device is Space Gray. If the light falls onto the surface in a certain way, this color, unlike Apple's Space Gray, actually looks slightly purple. Not everyone will appreciate this color choice, so we would have liked at least one other color option. The bezels above and on the sides of the display are only 5.2 mm wide, which leads to a screen-to-body ratio of almost 90 percent. Both the base unit and display cover are very solid and sturdy. The base unit only gives way to pressure in the middle above the keyboard. This shouldn't impact everyday use in any way. The hinges are well adjusted but cannot quite make up for the fact that the display is rather large and deep due to the 3:2 screen ratio. The laptop is fairly easy to open with one hand, but the display teeters slightly when adjusting the opening angle (max 145 degrees). Despite its large 16-inch panel, the MateBook is the narrowest device in our group of comparison devices. Its 3:2 screen ratio also makes it the deepest. All comparison devices are very similar in terms of thickness. The MateBook is one of the heaviest devices in our comparison table at exactly 2 kg, which doesn't make it the most portable solution. The AC adapter weighs another 400 grams. Huawei has decided to equip its MateBook 16 with both USB C ports (that can be used for recharging) and USB A ports. This is very useful as users do not need to resort to adapters. The HDMI port supports the 2.0 standard, which means the device can connect to 4K monitors with up to 60 Hz. Huawei has chosen to equip the MateBook 16 with the well-known Intel Wi-Fi module AX200 that supports the current Wi-Fi 6 standard (802.11ax) with 160 Hz as well as Bluetooth 5.1. Our standardized Wi-Fi test with the Netgear Nighthawk RAX120 router results in very good transfer rates, which we can confirm based on our experience while using the device. We did not encounter any limitations in terms of speed or signal. The device behaved just as well with the AVM Fritz!Box 7590 (Wi-Fi 5, 802.11ac). While Huawei has repositioned the webcam to the top of the screen for the new MateBook 14s , the manufacturer has kept the MateBook 16's webcam in its usual position in the top row of the keyboard. This is good in terms of security but leads to a rather distorted perspective. The quality of the 720p sensor is quite meager as well, even in good lighting. The bottom of the base unit is held in place with only a few Torx T6 screws and is easy to remove. Not that there is much to do on the inside - only the Wi-Fi module and the M.2 2280 SSD (which is beneath another metal plate that can be removed easily) can be replaced. The RAM module is soldered on and cannot be upgraded. Huawei has equipped the MateBook 16 with the well-known black chiclet keyboard without a dedicated number pad. Fortunately, the available space on either side of the keyboard isn't wasted as the manufacturer has used it for the speakers. The typing experience is average with an even and pronounced pressure point. The keyboard is very quiet, although some keys rattle more than others. The base of the keyboard probably isn't completely even. There are definitely better keyboards out there, especially when looking at professional laptops, but the MateBook 16 still is perfectly acceptable even if you spend many hours typing. The keyboard is equipped with white two-tier background lighting for working in dark surroundings. Users can set the backlighting to automatically turn off during inactivity via the preinstalled PC Manager (can be accessed by pressing the F10 key). The power button is positioned outside the keyboard and has an integrated fingerprint scanner that works reliably and quickly in our test. The ClickPad is very large at 14 x 9.1 cm and offers sufficient space for gestures with up to four fingers. The fingers glide over the pad easily. As is the case with many devices, the noise the integrated keys make is a little too loud, which slightly impacts the overall high-quality impression. We would recommend simply using tap to click to avoid the issue. Similar to other Huawei models, the new MateBook 16 is equipped with a panel that has a 3:2 screen ratio. The 16-inch panel has 2520 x 1680 pixels, which results in a pixel density of 189 DPI. The reflective display gives a great impression, subjectively. Screen contents is displayed very clearly and colors are strong. The viewing angle stability of the BOE IPS panel is very good. According to the technical data sheet, the Huawei MateBook 16 has a brightness of 300 nits. Our panel actually tops this with an average 350 nits. The black value is very low, which corresponds to a very good contrast ratio of 1700:1. There is some backlight bleeding along the edges at maximum brightness. This isn't an issue in everyday use and is only visible along the bottom when displaying videos with a ratio of 16:9. We did not detect any PWM flickering. Our analysis (CalMAN Professional, X-Rite i1 Pro 2) has shown that the panel is already well calibrated ex-works. The grayscales have a slight blue cast, but this isn't visible to the eye. The colors are all within the ideal range and do not require additional calibration. Our own calibration only minimally improved the display (link available in the information box above). The colors cover the smaller sRGB color space almost entirely, which makes the panel suitable for editing images and video. The display's only real weakness is the extremely reflective surface, as is illustrated by the pictures shown below. It is almost impossible to use the device outdoors on a sunny day and reflections can even be a slight problem when working indoors. The MateBook 16 is available with the AMD Ryzen 5 5600H (6 Zen-3 cores) or the Ryzen 7 5800H (8 Zen-3 cores) for a surcharge of 100 Euro. The remaining features of the two configurations are identical with 16 GB of RAM and a 512 GB PCIe-SSD. The key combination Fn+P allows users to switch between balanced and performance mode, but we did not measure a difference in CPU or iGPU performance. The AMD Ryzen 7 5800H has 8 fast Zen-3 cores (16 threads) and reaches a maximum of 4.4 GHz. The chip is produced using the 7-nm process, which has a positive effect on efficiency. The Ryzen 7 5800H currently is one of the fastest 45-Watt mobile processors, as the impressive benchmarks below show. The processor's power consumption peaks at 65 Watt and then immediately stabilizes at around 54 Watt, which leads to very stable performance. The IdeaPad Pro , equipped with the same processor, offers comparable performance while the other models, equipped with Intel chips, do not stand a chance against the AMD processor in Multi or Single Core tests. To be fair, these devices are not equipped with the fastest processors. But the results remain similar when looking at some (significantly more expensive) mobile workstations such as the Dell Precision 5560 or the ThinkPad P1 G4 (the high-end version with Vapor Chamber) equipped with the Intel Core i7-11850H . There are implementations of the Core i7-11800H that provide even more performance (in some gaming laptops, for example), but only combined with very high levels of power consumption (~100 Watt in the case of the Alienware x17 ). All this illustrates the notable improvement in efficiency of the current AMD chips and the fact that the MateBook 16 can even keep up with models of a much higher price range. When running on battery, the processor consumes 54 Watt for a few seconds and is then limited to 35 Watt. This only leads to a loss of around 10 percent in the Multi Core test (1793 points in CBR15 Multi). For more information on CPU benchmarks, please visit our Tech page. Despite the lack of a dedicated GPU, the MateBook 16 achieves excellent results in the synthetic PCMark 10 and easily reaches the top of our comparison table. Our subjective impression was equally good. We found the MateBook 16 to be a particularly fast and responsive companion during everyday use. The MateBook 16 supports the upgrade to Windows 11, which makes the Huawei notebook future-proof. Huawei Share enables users to easily share files between various Huawei devices such as tablets and smartphones and even to use a tablet as a second screen (mirrored or expanded display). This worked very well in our test with a MatePad Pro (from 2020) and we did not encounter any issues or delays. Our standardized latency test (browsing the web with several browser tabs open, playing a 4K video on YouTube, CPU load) did not indicate any issues with our test unit, which makes it suitable for the use of applications with real-time audio. The individual 512-GB M.2 2280 SSD from Lite-On is connected via PCIe 3.0 x4. The transfer rates are excellent and at the limit of what the PCIe 3.0 interface is capable of, so upgrading the storage device only makes sense if you need more storage space. As with other Huawei laptops, the SSD is already partitioned ex-works, which is rather unnecessary and can actually lead to problems. The system drive only has 71 GB available after the initial startup, so some users might soon reach a limit if they aren't careful about downloading and installing files and programs. The remaining 337 GB are available on the Data (D) partition. Find out more about SSD benchmarks here . The processor's Radeon RX Vega 8 is responsible for displaying graphics. Its raw performance is about 20 - 30 percent (depending on the benchmark) below the fastest models of Intel's current Iris Xe Graphics G7 with 96 EUs and about 30 percent faster than the old Vega 8 in the Ryzen 4000 generation . The big advantage of the current Vega 8 is its significantly improved video decoder has become a lot more efficient and can now beat the Intel Iris Xe (about 8 percent vs. 32 percent GPU load when playing 4K video). The MateBook 16 easily passed the demanding 3DMark Time Spy stress test (99.6 percent) and the graphics performance remains stable when running on battery. Find out more about GPU benchmarks here . The gaming performance of the MateBook 16 is limited due to the missing dedicated GPU. Users can nonetheless play some older or less demanding titles such as the new FIFA 22 or DOTA 2 at high settings. Performance remains stable even during long gaming sessions. Find out more about the Vega 8's gaming benchmarks here . The cooling system seems to work very well despite the device's high performance as it remains virtually silent most of the time when surfing the web or playing high-resolution videos. The first fan stage (at around 27 dB(A)) is only slightly audible in silent surroundings. The fan remains calm even when gaming; we measured a maximum of 32 dB(A) during Witcher 3. Games with a heavy load on the CPU do cause the fans to turn up slightly but not loud enough to make it difficult to use the internal speakers. Only when the CPU is under continuous full load will the fans become very audible, although it takes about a minute before you start hearing them even then. The fans reach their maximum volume of around 42 dB(A) after several minutes. Fortunately, the frequency of the fan noise isn't particularly high. We did not notice any other electronic noises such as coil whine. The case of the MateBook 16 hardly heats up during everyday tasks/low loads. When the device is put under load, the heat development is mainly contained to the back center area of the bottom of the base unit where we measured a hotspot of 50 \u00b0C. The device can still be used on the lap, even under these conditions, as this area of the device usually isn't in direct contact with your body. On the top of the base unit, users will feel the keyboard heat up slightly during the stress test, but this won't really lead to any restrictions. The MateBook 16 impresses with a very stable performance and a total CPU consumption of 54 Watt during the stress test. The processor clocks at an average of 8 x 2.8 GHz and the iGPU clocks at 1,750 MHz. The sound created by the two stereo speakers next to the keyboard is surprisingly loud and full-bodied. The bass is missing, of course, but both videos and music sound quite good on the device. While the competing Dell XPS 15 has slightly better speakers, these also tend to overdrive in certain cases. The high-resolution display consumes a fair amount of power in general and the MateBook 16 has the highest power consumption of all comparison devices with an iGPU when under load. The maximum power consumption under load is 100 Watt, which then settles down to 90 Watt. The included 135-Watt AC adapter is sufficient and can continue to recharge the device while under heavy load. The 84-Wh battery provides a very good battery life. We reached 13 hours in our video test and 11 hours in our Wi-Fi test, both with a brightness of 150 nits (around 46 percent of maximum brightness). The Wi-Fi battery life is still good at maximum brightness and reaches 8.5 hours. The battery drains within 1.5 hours under load. Despite the promoted SuperCharge technology, we weren't able to get the quick charging function to work (there were no settings in the PC Manager either). After about 65 minutes, the battery reached 50 percent capacity. Fully recharging the battery took about 150 minutes in our test with the device turned on. The new MateBook 16 gave a very good impression in our test - particularly considering its price. The device can easily keep up with the significantly more expensive Dell XPS 15 in terms of quality and also stands out from the crowd of competitors wrapped in plastic. While the MateBook 16 isn't the lightest or slimmest notebook, this has a positive impact on its rigidity and thermal characteristics as well as fan noise. Thinner isn't always better. Huawei has decided to equip its MateBook with a powerful Ryzen 5000 processor with 45 W that can stand up to continuous load without its performance suffering. Although Intel's current Tiger Lake processors (such as the i7-11800H ) also offer performance on this level, they require a lot more power to do so. As a consequence, the MateBook 16 offers more CPU performance than most current workstations, which are almost exclusively still all based on Intel CPUs. AMD has also optimized the power consumption of the CPUs and the device's battery life is very good. The MateBook 16 is not equipped with a dedicated GPU, so users looking to play new games on their device will have to look elsewhere. Other than that, the iGPU is very well suited for everyday applications and displaying high-resolution video, which is further supported by good loudspeakers. The new 3:2 display does a good job in most areas, but it is very reflective, which could sometimes lead to difficulties reading the screen. The MateBook 16 is a good multimedia notebook without any serious weaknesses. Its high CPU performance beats most mobile workstations and the display is good. Not to mention the excellent price-to-performance ratio. Of course there are several areas that could still be improved, such as the position and quality of the webcam, switching to a plugged RAM module und integrating USB 4, although at least the latter point should be resolved with the next generation of AMD CPUs. The slightly limited connectivity (no SD card reader) also had a small impact on our rating. Nonetheless, we can definitely recommend the MateBook 16, not least because of its affordable price. Our review has shown what the XPS 15 with an iGPU could look like if it were finally equipped with an AMD CPU. Users that are interested in more gaming performance should take a look at the IdeaPad 5 Pro , which combines the fast Ryzen 7 processor with the GeForce GTX 1650 . The Schenker Vision 15 ,on the other hand, is a lot more portable and offers slightly more graphics performance. The MateBook 16 is only available in Asia and Europe at the time of writing, but it is expected to become available in the UK and the US in the near future.",

    "full_description": "We're always happy to see an elegant ultraportable laptop for under $1,000, especially if it has convenient HDMI and USB Type-A ports as well as USB-C/Thunderbolt ports, unlike the class-leading Dell XPS 13 . The 13.3-inch Samsung Galaxy Book Pro ($974.99 as tested) not only checks those boxes but boasts a spiffy AMOLED screen like those of Samsung's smartphones, all in a feather-light 1.96-pound package. So why doesn't this review bear our Editors' Choice award insignia? Because the Galaxy Book Pro base model is also the maxed-out model, with 8GB of memory and a 256GB solid-state drive when multitaskers look for double those amounts, especially in this price range. It's a sleek, tempting choice for everyday Microsoft Office and online work, but power users will want something more configurable. The Galaxy Book Pro clamshell model (distinguished from the regular Galaxy Book by its AMOLED versus IPS screen technology) is available in 13.3-inch and 15.6-inch display sizes, both with the familiar full HD (1,920-by-1,080-pixel) resolution and 16:9 aspect ratio instead of the taller 16:10 or 3:2 ratios that have become popular of late. Samsung doesn't offer a higher-resolution panel, nor a touch-screen option. Our Windows 10 Pro test unit (model NP930XDB-KH1US) is listed among Samsung's business products for $1,099.99 on sale for $974.99; an otherwise identical consumer model has Windows 11 Home for $999.99. Clad in an aluminum-magnesium alloy the company calls Mystic Silver (with a white keyboard deck), the Intel Evo -compliant laptop combines its 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD with a quad-core, 2.4GHz Core i5-1135G7 processor . Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth are standard, as is a fingerprint reader integrated with the power button (which you may not use much, since opening the lid turns the system on). Thirteen-inch ultraportables are all roughly the same footprint-size, though the Samsung is one of the trimmest and lightest at 0.44 by 12 by 7.9 inches and 1.96 pounds. The Dell XPS 13 OLED is 0.58 by 11.6 by 7.8 inches and the 2.2-pound HP Pavilion Aero is 0.67 by 11.7 by 8.2 inches. The Galaxy Book Pro's light weight is reflected in its considerable flex if you grasp the screen corners or press the keyboard deck. Its screen bezels are thin but the webcam at top center has no privacy shutter. Laptops don't come any thinner than the Samsung, at least not with real ports. An HDMI video output joins two USB Type-C ports, one with Thunderbolt 4 capability, on the left side. One USB 3.2 Type-A port, a microSD card slot, and a headphone jack are on the right. The compact AC adapter has a USB-C connector. The 1080p AMOLED display provides inky blacks and washday-white backgrounds, with phenomenal contrast. (Samsung rates its contrast ratio at 1,000,000:1.) The latter helps the display seem extra-bright, though in reality it didn't excel in our hardware brightness measurement (see the test results below). Colors are rich, vivid, and well saturated, and fine details are clear. Reflections come into play at extreme viewing angles. Bottom-mounted speakers produce somewhat soft, muffled sound; bass is scanty (drumbeats sound like static), and it's hard to hear overlapping tracks. Audio gets louder and harsher if you turn on the Dolby Access software, which offers music, movie, game, voice, and custom modes and an equalizer. The backlit keyboard has a shallow but snappy typing feel; it teams the Fn key with the cursor arrows in lieu of dedicated Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys. The arrows and top-row keys including Escape and Delete are small. Pressing Fn+F11 cycles through optimized, silent, and high performance cooling-fan modes. (We used the high-performance mode for our benchmarks, except for optimized for the battery test.) The buttonless touchpad glides and taps smoothly but clicks stiffly. Samsung preloads the Galaxy Book Pro with nearly 20 house-brand apps ranging from security tools (applying an opaque effect to thwart screen snoops or emailing you a photo of anyone who tries to log in while you are away from the machine) to screen color modes (native, sRGB, Adobe RGB, or DCI-P3), plus tools for exchanging files with your Galaxy phone. The most bizarre is Beauty Filter, which works with the webcam to whiten skin or redden lips, apply foundation or blush, or give you a \"cute nose\" (narrowing your nostrils) or \"slim chin\" (making you look less jowly). Without the software's help, the 720p camera captures somewhat blotchy, soft-focus images with a fair amount of noise or static. For our benchmark round, I pitted the Galaxy Book Pro against the aforementioned HP Pavilion Aero and the Asus ZenBook 13 , both of which boast an eight-core AMD Ryzen 7 5800U processor. The remaining two slots went to Lenovo ultraportables with the same Core i5-1135G7 CPU as the Samsung: the ThinkBook 13s Gen 2 , and the ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 . You can see the contenders' basic specs in the table below. The main benchmark of UL's PCMark 10 simulates a variety of real-world productivity and content-creation workflows to measure overall performance for office-centric tasks such as word processing, spreadsheeting, web browsing, and videoconferencing. We also run PCMark 10's Full System Drive test to assess the load time and throughput of a laptop's storage. (See more about how we test laptops .) Three benchmarks focus on the CPU, using all available cores and threads, to rate a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads. Maxon's Cinebench R23 uses that company's Cinema 4D engine to render a complex scene, while Primate Labs' Geekbench 5.4 Pro simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning. Finally, we use the open-source video transcoder HandBrake 1.4 to convert a 12-minute video clip from 4K to 1080p resolution (lower times are better). Our final productivity test is workstation maker Puget Systems' PugetBench for Photoshop , which uses the Creative Cloud version 22 of Adobe's famous image editor to rate a PC's performance for content creation and multimedia applications. It's an automated extension that executes a variety of general and GPU-accelerated Photoshop tasks ranging from opening, rotating, resizing, and saving an image to applying masks, gradient fills, and filters. The Samsung underwhelmed in our CPU tests, which were predictably dominated by the eight-core Ryzen 7 chips in the Asus and HP, but easily cleared the 4,000 points that indicate competent office productivity in PCMark 10. It's not the quickest by a long shot, but its gorgeous screen makes it a favorite for Photoshop work, unless you crave higher-than-1080p resolution. We test Windows PCs' graphics with two DirectX 12 gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark suite: Night Raid (more modest, suitable for laptops with integrated graphics) and Time Spy (more demanding, suitable for gaming rigs with discrete GPUs). We also run two tests from the cross-platform GPU benchmark GFXBench 5, which stresses both low-level routines like texturing and high-level, game-like image rendering. The 1440p Aztec Ruins and 1080p Car Chase tests, rendered offscreen to accommodate different display resolutions, exercise graphics and compute shaders using the OpenGL programming interface and hardware tessellation respectively. The more frames per second (fps), the better. Intel's 11th Generation Iris Xe integrated graphics are perkier than their predecessors and their AMD rivals, but fall far short of even a lower-end discrete GPU. None of these ultraportables is in the same ZIP code as a true gaming laptop when it comes to playing fast-paced titles, though they're suitable for casual games and streaming video and audio. (For more on that topic, see our deep dive on laptop integrated graphics in 2021 .) We test laptops' battery life by playing a locally stored 720p video file (the open-source Blender movie Tears of Steel Tears of Steel ) with display brightness at 50% and audio volume at 100%. We make sure the battery is fully charged before the test, with Wi-Fi and keyboard backlighting turned off. We also use a Datacolor SpyderX Elite monitor calibration sensor and its Windows software to measure a laptop screen's color saturation\u2014what percentage of the sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3 color gamuts or palettes the display can show\u2014and its 50% and peak brightness in nits (candelas per square meter). The Galaxy Book Pro's display may show only 323 nits at peak brightness in SpyderX testing instead of the 400-plus we usually look for, but its AMOLED technology makes it appear much brighter, and its color fidelity is off the charts. Laptop screens\u2014at least full HD as opposed to 4K screens\u2014don't come any better. The Samsung also tied with the ThinkPad for the most outstanding battery life, able to get you through not one but two full days of work or school. Of course it's a Windows laptop, but as odd as it sounds, we found ourselves thinking of the super-light Samsung Galaxy Book Pro as if it were a really great Chromebook \u2014too short on horsepower, memory, and storage for demanding content creation or video editing jobs, but a pleasure to use for everyday word processing, spreadsheeting, presentations, email, and browsing. It doesn't earn our highest recommendation because there are too many great ultraportables that can be configured with 16GB of RAM or 1TB SSDs, but it fills a nice niche at a reasonable price.",

Further Reading iOS 15 review: Forget quantity, Focus on quality iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1 most notably add SharePlay, a flagship feature intended for iOS 15 that didn't make the annual release's launch last month. SharePlay is Apple's word for a suite of features that allows consumption of content with other callers inside a FaceTime call, like watching synchronized streams of Apple TV+ shows and Apple Fitness+ workouts. There's also an API to allow third-party applications to offer the same features. The update additionally brings ProRes video-capture support to the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max\u2014another feature that missed the initial launch window. Other additions include the ability to store proof of COVID-19 vaccination in the Wallet app, a toggle for automatic camera switching when taking macro photos, and several bug fixes. Here are the full release notes for iOS 15.1: iOS 15.1 adds SharePlay, an entirely new way to have shared experiences with family and friends in FaceTime. This release also adds the ability to capture ProRes video using iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max, as well as verifiable COVID-19 vaccination cards in Apple Wallet, and includes other features and bug fixes for your iPhone. SharePlay - SharePlay is a new way to share synchronized experiences in FaceTime with content from the Apple TV app, Apple Music, Fitness+, and other supported App Store apps - Shared controls give everyone the ability to pause, play, rewind or fast forward - Smart volume automatically lowers the audio of a movie, TV show or song when your friends speak - Apple TV supports the option to watch the shared video on your big screen while you continue the FaceTime call on iPhone - Screen sharing lets everyone on a FaceTime call look at photos, browse the web, or help each other out Camera - ProRes video capture using iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max - Setting to turn off automatic camera switching when taking macro photos and videos on iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max Apple Wallet - COVID-19 vaccination card support allows you to add and present verifiable vaccination information from Apple Wallet Translate - Mandarin Chinese (Taiwan) support in the Translate app and for system-wide translation Home - New automation triggers based on the current reading of a HomeKit-enabled humidity, air quality, or light level sensor Shortcuts - New pre-built actions let you overlay text on images or gifs, plus a new collection of games lets you pass the time with Siri This release also fixes the following issues: - Photos app may incorrectly report storage is full when importing photos and videos - Weather app may not show current temperature for My Location, and may display colors of animated backgrounds incorrectly - Audio playing from an app may pause when locking the screen - Wallet may unexpectedly quit when using VoiceOver with multiple passes - Available Wi-Fi networks may not be detected - Battery algorithms updated on iPhone 12 models to better estimate battery capacity over time On the iPad, the update adds the above listed features and support for Live Text in the Camera app. With Live Text, the Camera can detect text, phone numbers, addresses, and more, with the feature available on iPads that have an A12 Bionic chip or later. Live Text was already available on the iPhone. For information on the security content of Apple software updates, please visit this website: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201222 Apple also launched watchOS 8.1, which mostly fixes bugs, but which also adds the same COVID-19 proof-of-vaccination feature we just saw in iOS. It also includes support for SharePlay on Fitness+ content. Advertisement Likewise, tvOS 15.1 is a minor update that fixes bugs and implements SharePlay support in tandem with iOS. All three updates should be available globally to most users on supported devices today.",

    "full_description": "Digital junk piles up too quickly. Look no further than your phone and all those blurry photos and old screenshots in your gallery. What you don\u2019t see are the invasive tracking cookies saved in your smartphone. Clutter on your computer can be even tougher to wrangle. Start with your Recycle Bin on a PC or Trash Can on a Mac. You need to manually empty that every so often. Cleaning up your computer doesn\u2019t take a ton of time. But you have to do it right, smart way. I can help. How many documents are stored on your computer that you really wouldn\u2019t want someone else to get their hands on? I know people who have an Excel spreadsheet loaded with their passwords stored in the open on the desktop. Maybe you keep financial records nicely organized or have a folder with all your essential medical documents. Beyond the privacy risk, think about what a pain it would be when your computer finally bites the dust. You don\u2019t want to end up in a pinch because you never saved those files someplace safer. My recommendation: Back up anything you don\u2019t want to lose to the cloud. Whatever option you go with, adhere to what tech pros call the 3-2-1 rule. Keep three copies of your important files: two on different storage media and one preserved in an off-site location. (Yes, the cloud counts.) If you do insist on saving private documents locally, at least give a snoop a more challenging time by naming the folder something off base like \u201cVacation Photos.\u201d Be sure your computer automatically locks when you\u2019re away and requires a password on startup, too. Programs take up a decent amount of space, so regularly clear out anything you\u2019re not using. Beyond that, outdated apps could put you at risk. By keeping old programs on your computer, you\u2019re potentially leaving a door wide open for cybercriminals to slip in. Here\u2019s how to find space-consuming apps and uninstall them. On a Windows PC: On a Mac: The latest version of whatever operating system you use is the safest. Updates, even minor ones, patch major security issues and vulnerabilities. One caveat: When a brand new version of an operating system rolls out, like Windows 11, it can take some time to work out the kinks. Unless you are comfortable troubleshooting new issues and rolling back to a previous version if necessary, wait a bit longer to update. To update Windows: To update a Mac: Checking out your task manager or activity monitor is an excellent way to see if anything strange is happening in the background. Sudden spikes are a bad sign. If you see that your activity has shot up even though you haven\u2019t been doing anything intensive, that could be a sign your computer is infected with malware. If you do see anything strange, run an antivirus or anti-malware scan. Check your activity on a PC: See your Mac\u2019s activity: Cleaning up the inside of your computer is important, but don\u2019t forget the outside. Dust, dirt, and grime can get into every nook and cranny. Apple is now selling a $19 polishing cloth, but a good old microfiber cloth is just fine to clean your screen. Just don\u2019t use scratchy paper towels. A dry cloth can wipe away most dirt and debris. For stubborn smudges and fingerprints, lightly dampen the cloth with distilled water. Never pour or spray water directly onto a screen and stay away from glass cleaner too. I prefer pre-moistened electronics wipes. They\u2019re so easy. I buy a big value pack from Care Touch . They\u2019re great on smaller screens like phones, tablets, and laptops. For TVs and bigger monitors, these wipes from Weiman work like a charm . A cluttered computer is one thing. One infected with malware is quite another. There are a few warning signs, like the temperature of your machine. If you put a hand on the screen or keyboard and it\u2019s hotter than you remember, don\u2019t ignore it. Malicious software can eat up storage space, overworking your processors and sending your fan into overdrive.",

    "full_description": "In its most basic form, a computer mouse is simple hardware\u2014a sensor on the bottom, two buttons and a scroll wheel on top\u2014that lets you interact with programs as though they were extensions of your own hand. But while a mouse is simple in concept, the market for them is a scattered field of mouse genres, prices, and designs. You need to know a little about the landscape when you go shopping for a new model. Over time, distinct classes of mice have evolved, each made for different computing situations. The most common of these is the mainstream desktop mouse, designed for use with a desktop or laptop PC at a desk or table. Aside from the inevitable right and left mouse buttons, the usual features are a clickable scroll wheel and, in some cases, additional thumb buttons that let you navigate forward and back in your web browser. Travel mice (or \"mobile mice\") offer many of these same features but come in a smaller size. They're designed to fit easily into the pocket of a backpack or laptop bag. For this same reason, however, travel mice tend to be small for most hands\u2014you can use them just fine for short stints, but they become uncomfortable over long periods due to the unnatural grip required. Generally speaking, travel mice are wireless and battery-powered, so you may want to bring along a spare set of AA or AAA batteries if that is what they use. Beyond these \"ordinary\" mice are two key mouse genres: the gaming mouse, and the ergonomic mouse. There's a lot of variance within each, and some crossover among all of these classes. (For example, a few \"travel gaming\" mice exist.) Let's take a look at the gaming field first, then move on to other genres and aspects that affect all mice. Gaming mice amplify every element of the basic mouse concept to the extreme: more buttons, higher tracking resolutions, curvier curves. Some gaming mice are general gaming models, while others are designed for specific game genres. In the latter case, depending upon the style of the game that the mouse is intended for (first-person shooter, real-time strategy game, MMO ), you may see a variety of specialized features. What most gaming mice have in common, though, is a combination of high-performance parts\u2014laser sensors, feather-light click buttons, gold-plated USB connectors\u2014and customization features, such as programmable macro commands and on-the-fly resolution switching. Gaming mice also stand apart in that the better ones tend to feature vendor-supplied software for setting up these custom features and shortcuts, defined sometimes on a per-game basis via profiles. The software's quality and functionality can vary wildly from vendor to vendor; that's where our reviews come in. Certain utilities are easier to pick up than others. For maximum comfort, some gaming mice let you customize the body of the mouse itself. Removable weights are common, letting you tweak the total heft of the mouse one way or the other. Some models take this even further, letting you shift the center of balance, or adjust the height and pitch of the palm rest. For non-gamers, these features are overkill; for dedicated gamers, they provide a competitive edge. Finding the ideal gaming mouse for you comes down to knowing your preferred style of game, determining whether or not you will take advantage of any of a mouse's more complex functions (it's easy to overspend on a gaming mouse), and then tweaking your choice to your specific tastes. Drive by our gaming mouse roundup for much more detail on the nuances of these mice. Ergonomics-first designs put all of the typical mouse functions into a form factor that places your hand in a neutral position. Designed to reduce the stresses that can lead to carpal tunnel and repetitive strain injury, ergonomic mice may look unusual and take some getting used to, but they do alleviate some very real problems. Some have a vertical design; others may have one-off sculpts. Whether you're looking at a specialized ergonomic mouse, or comfort is simply a concern in a more ordinary one, pay attention to the size of your mouse. (Make sure that it's not too big or too small for your hand.) Weight is also a consideration. Some people prefer a heavier mouse that anchors the hand, while others, especially players of MOBA games, want something light that furnishes little resistance to flicking and clicking. As a rule of thumb, a heavier mouse requires more effort to move, and even though the difference may not seem like much, over time it can mount. It's not just weight and size that are important. The sculpting of the mouse can also lead to unnecessary strain on (or conversely, extra support for) your hand and wrist. The most comfortable mice will fit the contour of your hand, rather than having a flat, shallow shape. Some mice have a thumb rest, providing a resting spot from which the finger can rise as needed to activate controls. (See our guide to the best ergonomic mice for more about the nuances of these very variable mice, in addition to a discussion of trackballs.) The simplest way to hook up a mouse to your PC is through a wired USB connection. Computer mice are usually plug-and-play devices, with no additional software to install (with the exception of higher-end gaming mice), meaning that plugging in the cable is all the setup you'll need to deal with. Unlike wireless alternatives, a wired device will draw its power over USB, so there are no batteries to worry about. Wired connections are also preferable for serious gaming or esports use (no battery to conk out in the midst of a match), though some high-end wireless mice are indistinguishable, from a response-time perspective, from wired ones. If you want more freedom and less cable clutter on your desk, however, it's hard to beat a wireless mouse. Instead of a wired connection, wireless mice transmit data to your PC through one of two primary means: an RF connection to a USB receiver, or via Bluetooth. (Some mice actually support both, but this is less common than supporting just one.) Both have their pros and cons, but if you want to reduce the number of cables on your desk and gain the flexibility to use your mouse unhindered\u2014or even from across the room\u2014wireless is the way to go. Most wireless mice connect to the host computer via the same 2.4GHz wireless frequency used by cordless phones and some Wi-Fi Internet bands. A dime-size USB dongle\u2014small enough to plug in and forget about\u2014provides the link to your PC. Know, however, that only in some isolated cases (such as with Logitech's Unifying-branded gear) can a single USB dongle provide connectivity to more than one device. That means that unless the vendor specifically notes otherwise, you can't use the same adapter for your wireless mouse and keyboard . You may need to devote two USB ports to separate mouse and keyboard USB dongles. Bluetooth options, in contrast, don't monopolize a USB port, and the stable, easy-to-manage connections are ideal for use with mobile devices, such as ultraportables , tablet PCs , and 2-in-1s . In regular use, a Bluetooth connection gives you roughly 30 feet of wireless range, but a Bluetooth mouse may not match the battery life offered by devices with an RF-based USB dongle. New innovations, such as motion sensors tied to power and connection management, can improve the battery life versus older Bluetooth devices, which maintained an always-on link that drained battery relatively quickly. But you'll want to look at the vendors' estimated battery life on a charge (as well as whether the mouse uses an internal battery you recharge, or disposables). Most of today's mice use one of two types of light-based motion sensor: optical/LED, or laser. Unlike mechanical tracking options of yore, light-based sensors have fewer issues with dust and dirt, and the absence of moving parts means fewer failures. Optical sensors pair a glowing LED beam\u2014often red, blue, or infrared\u2014with a small photo sensor, tracking movement by repeatedly imaging the surface below the mouse, translating any movement of the mouse into cursor movement. (The frequency of this imaging is called the \"polling rate,\" expressed as hertz, or hundreds of instances per second.) Because of the imaging sensor used, optical mice are a little less prone to problems caused by lifting the mouse when in use or by mousing on an uneven surface. Laser mice operate in a similar way, but they use an infrared laser diode instead of an LED. This allows, in some cases, for greater potential sensitivity (measured in dots per inch, or dpi) and polling rates. The one drawback is that they can be finicky about the surfaces on which they are used. Premium gaming mice generally use laser sensors, and they tend to work better with opaque mouse-pad surfaces meant for mousing; LEDs can be more forgiving. But this is not an absolute, and frankly, if you're concerned at all about mousing precision, a basic mouse pad will solve all ails. To offer the higher sensitivity of a laser sensor and the versatility of an optical mouse, a few isolated mice use both in tandem. Most better gaming mice also offer sensitivity adjustment, letting you shift from a precision setting for tight cursor-control circumstances (such as lining up a sniper's shot) to a broader-sweep one for melee combat and run-and-gun situations, or panning across an RTS world. This may be via dedicated-purpose button, or you may be able to program one of the mouse's buttons or toggles to execute resolution/sensitivity changes on the fly.

    "full_description": "A non-fungible token featuring former President Donald Trump is helping draw Wall Street attention to a small digital content company from northern New Jersey. Shares of Creatd shot up more than 30% on Monday to about $5.50 only hours after the company announced it is selling a Trump NFT for 240 ethereum \u2014 or just over $1 million based on the latest price of the cryptocurrency. The digital image features three photos of Trump, snapped long before his presidency, signing the bare chest of a woman described on Creatd's site as an \"Ivanka look-a-like.\" The company obtained the images from the creditors of Penthouse magazine founder Bob Guccione, who died in 2010. \"They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and the Trump photographs are no exception,\" Creatd founder Jeremy Frommer said in a statement. \"We have waited a long time to sell these priceless images which were captured decades before they took on the significance and symbolism they hold today.\" Creatd, which employs roughly 50 full-time workers in Fort Lee, New Jersey, is hoping to cash in on the ongoing craze for NFTs . An NFT is unique proof of ownership over something intangible, such as a piece of digital art or video clip. The one-of-a-kind token is stored and protected using blockchain technology and smart contracts . Buying an NFT means purchasing a hacker-resistant, public proof of ownership over a digital asset that can be traded or sold but cannot be duplicated or broken into smaller parts. The technology has emerged as a new way to collect everything from high-end art to sports memorabilia . 60 Minutes+ explains the NFT art craze 06:36 Laurie Weisberg, Creatd's co-CEO, said the Trump NFT will help the company \"continue exploring the NFT space and capitalize on the economic opportunities it can foster for the creator community.\" Creatd's market splash comes just days after the stock price of Trump's new social media venture also soared. Shares of blank-check company Digital World Acquisition Corp. surged as much as 1,200%. In its press release, Creatd said it intends \"to continue to release unique NFTs,\" which Weisberg said \"represent an opportunity to inspire conversation, and debate perspectives, from sharing light hearted wisecracks to ardent political judgments.\" Trending News What's behind the push for a fourth stimulus check Why many Black employees don't want to return to the office Facebook researchers saw how its algorithms led to misinformation Walmart recalls room spray for \"rare and dangerous\" bacteria Facebook internal documents show execs knew platform spread misinformation and failed to act at times Khristopher J.

Salwan Georges/The Washington Post via Getty Images reader comments 30 with 26 posters participating Share this story Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving software lived up to its \u201cbeta\u201d label this weekend. On Saturday morning, CEO Elon Musk announced a delay for the 10.3 update after internal quality-assurance testers discovered that the new version performed worse at left turns at traffic lights than previous versions. Then, on Sunday afternoon, Musk said that Tesla would be \u201crolling back to 10.2 temporarily\u201d after reports of sudden braking, false warnings, and other issues. Several owners reported that their vehicles braked suddenly when the software mistakenly reported an imminent collision. Known as automatic emergency braking (or AEB), neither the feature nor its bugs are limited to Tesla\u2014Mazda recalled some of its cars in 2019 for similar problems. When working properly, forward-collision warning and automatic emergency braking work in concert to prevent a vehicle from crashing into objects in its path. A combination of sensors and software first alerts drivers to an impending collision and, if no action is taken, forcefully applies the brakes. Cars that experience phantom alerts that lead to emergency braking events risk getting rear-ended if they stop quickly in dense traffic or if traveling at high speeds. \u201cHaving AEB activate in the middle of the highway was terrifying,\u201d one Tesla driver reported on reddit. While false automatic emergency braking events and false forward-collision warnings appear to be the most widespread issues, other drivers reported false lane-departure warnings and a disabling of both forward-collision warning and automatic emergency braking without warning. Further Reading Elon Musk announces another price hike for \u201cfull self-driving\u201d package Tesla has offered Full Self-Driving as an expensive option on its vehicles, with people paying up to $10,000 for the prospect of gaining access to the software when it\u2019s released. But years have elapsed since the option was first introduced, and only recently has a select group of owners been able to access a beta version of the feature. Tesla distributed Full Self-Driving to an initial wave of 2,000 drivers, and it has been expanding access to limited groups based on a driver\u2019s \u201csafety score,\u201d which the company calculates from telemetry data gathered by its vehicles. The first expansion gave access to drivers with scores of 100 out of 100, while the next group had scores of 99. Advertisement Today, the automaker released another update , 10.3.1, and began pushing it to eligible vehicles. One reddit user suggested that the most widespread bug might be related to a conflict between the automatic emergency braking system and Tesla\u2019s Sentry Mode, a security system that monitors the vehicle when parked. If true, that would be a concerning development, suggesting that a bug in a noncritical feature caused an issue with a safety system. Typically, automakers keep vehicle safety systems separate because the cost of development for those features is significantly higher. NTSB letter Further Reading NTSB: Tesla\u2019s Autopilot UX a \u201cmajor role\u201d in fatal Model S crash [Updated] Tesla is also under pressure to address two safety recommendations made by the National Transportation Safety Board more than four years ago. The agency made them after investigating the crash that killed Joshua Brown, whose Model S broadsided a semi trailer in his path. The agency determined that Brown drove on Autopilot for extended periods without his hands on the wheel and that he was using the feature on roads for which it wasn\u2019t designed. The NTSB has asked Tesla to limit when and where Autopilot can be used and to implement stricter monitoring for driver attentiveness. \u201cOur crash investigations involving your company\u2019s vehicles have clearly shown that the potential for misuse requires a system design change to ensure safety,\u201d NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy wrote . \u201cIf you are serious about putting safety front and center in Tesla vehicle design, I invite you to complete action on the safety recommendations we issued to you four years ago.\u201d Autopilot is a Level 2 advanced driver-assistance system, meaning that drivers must monitor the vehicle at all times. Currently, most automakers, including Tesla, test for driver engagement by periodically checking whether torque is being applied to the steering wheel. Other systems, like GM\u2019s SuperCruise and Ford\u2019s BlueCruise, use eye tracking. No system , though, is foolproof. The NTSB\u2019s letter does not seem to have affected Tesla\u2019s stock price, which soared to a record high and sent its market cap over $1 trillion for the first time, perhaps on the news that rental car company Hertz placed an order for 100,000 Model 3s .",

The report explains that the US DOJ has \u201caccelerated\u201d the antitrust probe into Apple, which it first opened back in 2019 . Citing people familiar with the matter, the report says that there has been a \u201cflurry of activity on the investigation\u201d since the summer. This includes a new round of subpoenas being sent to Apple\u2019s business partners, additional DOJ staff being assigned to the probe, and more. The investigation thus far has revealed what DOJ lawyers believe are \u201cserious issues.\u201d The investigation is very likely to lead to a lawsuit, though the specifics are still in flux, one of the people said. The DOJ has also assigned more staff to the probe, that person said. In late July two insurance companies abandoned their merger following a DOJ lawsuit, and some of the lawyers on that case moved to the Apple probe, the person said. DOJ lawyers are uncovering what they believe are serious issues and the investigation remains ongoing, the person said. The DOJ probe is said to focus on a wide array of issues, with the broad focus being on Apple\u2019s power as a technology market leader. Specific concerns raised in the report include App Tracking Transparency, Sign in with Apple, and the App Store. The DOJ is also looking into \u201ccomplaints about how Apple places restrictions on location tracking that its own apps don\u2019t have to follow.\u201d Finally, the report points out that Jonathan Kanter, the incoming head of the DOJ\u2019s antitrust division, has previously represented opponents of Apple, including Spotify, Tile, Match, and Basecamp. It\u2019s unclear how this could affect the Apple probe, but the report outlines: In private practice Kanter represented opponents of Apple including Match, Tile, Spotify and Basecamp, according to a recent financial disclosure, which did not specify whether he represented those companies in the DOJ\u2019s Apple investigation. It\u2019s possible Kanter might not be in the office until December. However, the person with knowledge of the probe said that the timing of a case against Apple will not hinge on when Kanter starts. Furthermore, the person said it remains unclear whether Kanter\u2019s work in private practice will require his recusal from the Apple investigation.

Microsoft, in a blog post dated October 24, said Nobelium\u2019s latest wave targeted \u201cresellers and other technology service providers\u201d of cloud services. Those attacks were part of a broader campaign over the summer, Microsoft said, adding it had notified 609 customers between July 1 and October 19 that they had been attacked. Just a small percent of the latest attempts were successful, Microsoft told the New York Times , which first reported the breach, but it gave no further details. US cybersecurity officials could not be immediately reached to confirm the report. US officials confirmed to the Times that the operation was underway, with one unnamed senior administration official calling it \"unsophisticated, run-of-the mill operations that could have been prevented if the cloud service providers had implemented baseline cybersecurity practices.\" \"This recent activity is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling \u2013 now or in the future \u2013 targets of interest to the Russian government,\" Microsoft wrote.

    "full_description": "Do you like scary movies? Well, you\u2019ve come to the right place, because Amazon Prime Video has hundreds of horror titles among its archive of thousands of films and TV shows. You\u2019ll find spine-chilling classics and modern masterpieces, heaps of enjoyable B-movie filler, and some movies so bad they\u2019re\u2026actually just godawful (Sharkenstein? Seriously?). To help you sort the good from the beastly, we trawled through the streaming platform\u2019s nightmarish depths and returned to compile our list of the best horror movies and shows on Amazon Prime Video. It includes the movie that birthed the modern zombie, a bonkers British thriller, one vampire-slaying TV comedy-drama, and gripping tales about angry Japanese ghosts. So, get ready to stream some terrifically terrifying entertainment as we bring you the 10 best horror movies and shows on Amazon Prime Video ready to watch this Halloween. Editor's note: We advise checking the Amazon Prime Video site in your region before signing to ensure that your movies of choice are available where you live \u201cThey\u2019re coming to get you Barbra!\u201d George A. Romero cemented his place in the Horror Hall of Fame with this low-budget picture about the recently deceased coming back to life to feast on the living. It gave birth to the modern zombie film \u2013 although the \u201cZ\u201d word isn't uttered here \u2013 and led to five Romero-directed sequels, including 1978\u2019s Dawn of the Dead. Opening with siblings Johnny and Barbra ambushed by a graveyard ghoul, Barbra breaks free to seek refuge with a terrified rabble of survivalists in an abandoned farmhouse. As tensions grow among the group, they find themselves besieged by the growing ranks of the living dead, with little chance of escape. Romero\u2019s film is pretty tame by modern standards. But it shocked contemporary viewers, being described by Variety as \u201can unrelieved orgy of sadism.\u201d It's a fair assessment, given our heroes return to life as cannibals, are dismembered \u2013 or worse \u2013 while one woman is brutalised with a masonry trowel by her reanimated daughter. Yikes! Its nihilistic vision reflects a time in which images of racial conflict and violence in Vietnam were rife, broadcast daily into American homes. The slasher film was back in vogue after the success of Scream, and people lined up around the block to see writer Kevin Williamson\u2019s latest about a hook-wielding psycho fisherman. Based on Lois Duncan\u2019s 1973 novel, it follows a group of friends whose lives veer off track when they\u2019re involved in a hit and run, killing a man and agreeing to dump the body in the ocean. They swear to take the secret to their graves. But a year later they\u2019re contacted by someone who claims to know\u2026 Well, y\u2019know. What they did? Last summer? Featuring an attractive cast of 90s TV stars, a hip soundtrack, and packed with no-nonsense frights, this fast-paced thriller lit up the box-office, taking $125 million dollars and becoming the seventh highest grossing slasher movie of all time. Proof of its popularity? It was mercilessly parodied in the so-so spoof Scary Movie, spawned a number of pale imitations, and has even been adapted into an Amazon Original TV series for Generation Z. Not long after Johnny Depp hit the Hollywood stratosphere post-Pirates, he landed the lead role of depressed writer Mort Rainey in an adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s \u2018Secret Window, Secret Garden\u2019 - a creepy head-scratcher taken from the author\u2019s Four Past Midnight collection. Having discovered his wife\u2019s infidelity, Mort retreats to his isolated cabin in upstate New York and falls into a writing funk. Six idle months pass when, out of nowhere, a Mississippian stranger by the name of John Shooter (John Turturro) arrives and accuses him of plagiarism. Mort refutes the heated claim, noting that his short story \u2018Secret Window\u2019 was published over two years ago. That is, until he discovers the two stories are virtually identical except for the ending. And in Shooter\u2019s version, the protagonist kills his wife. Depp is giddily entertaining in the kind of quirky role he excels at, and this slow-burn psychodrama keeps things weird and unpredictable until the very end. It ultimately opts for a bolder ending than the one King used, concluding events on a much darker note. The feature film debut of Emmanuel Osei-Kuffour Jr. delivers a troubling yet moving meditation on identity and trauma with a technological slant, coming across like Black Mirror meets Jacob's Ladder. It\u2019s part of the Welcome to the Blumhouse stable, an anthology of eight films produced by modern horror virtuoso Jason Blum (Get Out, Us, the 2018 Halloween reboot) for the Amazon Prime Video platform. When Nolan Wright (Mamoudou Athie) becomes the sole survivor of a car accident, he\u2019s left to raise his 10-year-old daughter Ava by himself while struggling with severe amnesia. Anxious of being judged unfit to care for Ava, he opts for an experimental procedure offered by Dr. Lilian Brooks (Phylicia Rashad). The titular \u201cblack box\u201d provides a virtual pathway into Wright\u2019s memories, allowing him to rebuild the shattered fragments of his psyche. But to his terror, his reminiscences are populated by faceless figures and the contorted Backwards Man, whom he must confront to recover the reality of who he really is. An A-list Hollywood cast and the director of Call Me By Your Name come together to \u201creimagine\u201d Dario Argento\u2019s classic giallo of the same name, one of the most iconic horror movies ever made. Luca Guadagnino kept the basic premise about American dancer Susie Bannion arriving in Germany to audition for a prestigious dance academy, only to find out it's being run by a coven of nasty witches. Other than that, it\u2019s almost an entirely different beast. While Argento\u2019s 1977 original evoked the sturm und drang of evil occurrences with expressionistic lighting, bold primary colours and a prog-rock score, Guadagnino\u2019s Suspiria provides an atmosphere of chilly malevolence and a languorous, art-house aesthetic. It\u2019s more of a cerebral experience than a bloodily visceral one, although the film is punctuated by some truly spectacular moments \u2013 in particular the enchanted death of a student trapped in a room full of mirrors. Plus, it has an incredible ensemble of actors, led by Tilda Swinton as Madame Blanc and Dakota Johnson as her enigmatic prot\u00e9g\u00e9. High school can be hell. That was the premise of Joss Whedon\u2019s highly influential TV series, a pop-culture landmark in which \u201cchosen one\u201d Buffy Summers and her gang of \u201cscoobies\u201d exchanged witticisms while fighting the forces of darkness. They battled blood-suckers, wayward scientists, mutants, demons from hell dimensions \u2013 all the evils. But the gothic horror elements were often perfectly blended with the anxieties of adolescence. Led by Sarah Michelle Gellar as a teen slayer with \u2018tude, the show ran for seven near-perfect seasons. Each episode would focus on a unique threat or monster, but the romantic and emotional storylines of the characters could extend over whole seasons, making the fantasy world of Buffy, Giles, Willow and Zander feel incredibly grounded. It got dark at times. Buffy had a tumultuous love affair with a vampire with an on-off soul; there was always an apocalypse to prevent; and the show wasn\u2019t afraid to portray complex experience like grief, sexual assault and depression. But the show never lost its heart\u2026even when someone was putting a stake through it. Japanese horror movie Ju-On: The Grudge helped popularise the figure of the \u201cvengeful ghost\u201d (or onry\u014d ) in the Western world. At the turn of the millennium therefore, the image of lank-haired, bug-eyed ghost girls was regularly projected on cinema screens. Although the Ju-On franchise began with two straight-to-video entries, director Takashi Shimizu was encouraged by the international success of 1998's Ring to produce a theatrically released sequel. Told in a non-linear fashion, his tale begins with the brutal murder of a family by a jealous husband. This tragedy engenders a terrible curse that affects anyone who enters the family\u2019s home, resulting in their terrifying death and causing them to become a vengeful spectre, too. What The Grudge may lack in narrative sense it makes up for in scares and a barrage of haunting, grotesque images. A hand emerging from one woman\u2019s wet hair, or pale-faced ghosts appearing underneath the victim's bedsheets. And, leaving a hauntingly macabre final impression, a bloodied corpse crawling downstairs to enrol school teacher Mariko on this undying cycle of terror. Not to be confused with the sci-fi film about giant ants or that 2006 home-invasion shocker, this Them is an Amazon Original series about the Emorys: a family from North Carolina confronting both the real and supernatural incarnations of racism in 1950s Los Angeles. Them stars Deborah Ayorinde and Ashley Thomas as a young couple who\u2019ve recently moved to the LA suburbs in search of a better life. They\u2019re overjoyed with their new abode. But their arrival makes their Caucasian neighbors anxious, and housewife Betty (Alison Pill) quickly launches a campaign of intimidation to drive them away. Meanwhile, the Emorys' youngest daughter Gracie perceives evil forces at home, one of which is a demonic minstrel in blackface. It\u2019s a grippingly acted and full-throttle series, potently revealing the psychological toll of prejudice in addition to more gruesome horrors. Director Neil Marshall followed up Dog Soldiers \u2013 his squaddies versus werewolves debut \u2013 with a brutal, bracing story about things that go spelunk in the night. A year after her husband and daughter\u2019s deaths in a car accident, Sarah and her thrill-seeking friends set off for an all-girls caving weekend. They\u2019re in high spirits - initially, at least - until they get trapped in an unexplored network of tunnels. Tempers fray and tensions start to emerge. But, once that panic has subsided, they realize that something else is down there with them. And it's very hungry. Inspired by survival horror films like Deliverance and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Descent engenders a feeling of breathless claustrophobia as characters squirm in the dark between immovable walls of rock, after which the film switches gears into a frenzy of caving carnage. Worse than the ravenous ferocity of the \u201ccrawlers\u201d is the gradual irruption of resentments and betrayals between the women, which threatens any remaining hope of escape. One of the best horror films of the noughties, The Descent is a work of blunt, brutal trauma. Funnily enough, The Wicker Man is the sole British folk horror musical on this list, and it\u2019s an utterly unique experience. The film weaves captivating songs through a bizarre narrative about a priggish police officer contacted to help find a girl missing on the Hebridean island of Summerisle. The problem is, once he gets there, all of the inhabitants deny that she ever existed. Edward Woodward plays \u201cChristian copper\u201d Sergeant Howie, whose conservative beliefs jar with the Celtic Paganism of the locals and their practices of public fornication and jumping naked over fires to encourage fertility. Horror veteran Ingrid Pitt features alongside Swedish actress Britt Ekland, while Christopher Lee (Count Dracula himself!) hams it up as the debonair Lord Summerisle. It\u2019s a genre-bending film, which Cinefantastique dubbed \u201cthe Citizen Kane of horror movies\". Rightly so too. Because when you finally meet the Wicker Man, every one of your hairs will be standing on end. Discover more:",

    "full_description": "Facebook has admitted that core parts of its platform appear hardwired for spreading misinformation and divisive content, according to a fresh wave of internal documents that showed the social media company struggled to contain hate speech in the developing world and was reluctant to censor rightwing US news organisations, The Guardian reported. An internal memo warned Facebook\u2019s \u201ccore product mechanics\u201d, or its basic workings, had let hate speech and misinformation grow on the platform. In March, a group of researchers inside Facebook compiled a report for one of the company\u2019s most powerful executives, Chief Product Officer Chris Cox. The paper included charts and data highlighting a troubling trend that seemed to be accelerating: Facebook was losing popularity with teens and young adults. According to Bloomberg, one colorful graphic showed that \u201ctime spent\u201d for US teenagers on Facebook was down 16 per cent YoY, and that young adults in the US were also spending 5 per cent less time on the social network. The number of new teen signups was declining, and perhaps most concerning was a series of slides showing that young people were taking much longer to join Facebook than they had in the past. The report is among hundreds of internal documents collected by former Facebook employee-turned-whistle-blower Frances Haugen, who went public in early October with accusations that Facebook has been prioritiSing profits over user safety and security. Among Haugen\u2019s arguments is that Facebook \u201chas misrepresented core metrics to investors and advertisers\u201d by showing overall growth but excluding details that show slowdowns in key demographics, according to the letter outlining her complaint. Documents viewed by Reuters show Facebook has known that it hasn't hired enough workers who possess both the language skills and knowledge of local events needed to identify objectionable posts in a number of developing countries. The documents also showed that the artificial intelligence systems Facebook employs to root out such content frequently aren't up to the task, either; Facebook will fuel more violent unrest around the world because of the way its algorithms are designed to promote divisive content, whistleblower Haugen told the British parliament on Monday. She said the social network saw safety as a cost centre and said it was \"unquestionably\" making hate worse. Apple once threatened Facebook ban over Mideast maid abuse Two years ago, Apple threatened to pull Facebook and Instagram from its app store over concerns about the platform being used as a tool to trade and sell maids in the Mideast. FB ack\u00adn\u00adowledged in internal documents that it was \u201cunder-enforcing on confir\u00admed abusive activity.\u201d Australia wants FB to seek parental consent for kids Australia plans to crack down on online advertisers targeting chil\u00addren by making social media seek parental consent for users younger than 16 years old to join or face fines of $7.5 million under a draft law. The legislation would protect Australians online and ensure that privacy laws are approp\u00adriate in the digital age, a government statement said.",

    "full_description": "Sony announced last that the previously PlayStation-exclusive god-and-fatherhood sim God of War will be coming to PC, which was very big news indeed. But the PC port won't actually be developed by Sony, which told Ars Technica that the project is being \"overseen\" by Sony Santa Monica, but developed by Jetpack Interactive. Jetpack Interactive isn't the most immediately recognizable game studio in the world, but its website lists several projects that it has contributed to in the past, including NBA Live 14, 15, and 16, Dark Souls, and Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare 2. Most of that work, however, has been in a supporting role: Jetpack provided engineering support for Garden Warfare 2 and the Dark Souls PC version, the latter of which was notoriously bad, although we can't pin that on a studio brought in for support. (In fact, From Software is the listed developer\u2014it's not clear what role Jetpack played.) It also did engineering and UI development support for NBA Live 16. The studio's only fully-standalone porting effort is actually the reverse of God of War on PC: It ported the PC release of Orcs Must Die! Unchained to the PlayStation 4. It's a little surprising that Sony would look to a support studio to handle the God of War port, especially since it now owns the very experienced PC port developer Nixxes Software . \"Kratos is Sony's Mario,\" we opined last week after the PC version was announced, and sharing it with non-PlayStation platforms is a very big deal. Another big Sony game, Horizon Zero Dawn, launched on PC last year with serious (and infuriatingly intermittent) performance issues that required multiple patches to solve, and Sony is surely eager to ensure that doesn't happen again, especially with its big dad game. Which isn't to say that Jetpack won't nail it, and naturally I hope it does. As for how exactly Sony Santa Monica will be involved beyond a vague oversight capacity, that's not clear. I've reached out to ask and will update if I receive a reply.",

    "full_description": "Spoilers\u2026but then if you don't know the story of \"Dune\" already, go to your local library and read it, immediately. For nearly five years, when Legendary Entertainment acquired the rights for \" Dune \" in November 2016 and Denis Villeneuve was eyed for the project, we've waited patiently to see the fruits of his labor. What could the visionary director who gave us the edge-of-seat \"Sicario,\" the enthralling \"Arrival\" and the masterpiece that is \" Blade Runner 2049 \" create from Frank Herbert's source novel? And now we know. First published in 1965 as two separate serials in Analog magazine, it won the Hugo Award and Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1966. It's the first installment \u2014 of which there are many \u2014 of the \" Dune Saga \" and has sold over 12 million copies worldwide. It's regarded as arguably the greatest work of science fiction ever written and one of the most important contributions to 20th century literature. \"Dune\" was also a massive influence to George Lucas when he was writing \" Star Wars \" (Tatooine and Arrakis, spice freighters, Spice Mines of Kessel etc). \"Dune\" is set over 8,000 years in the future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses control celestial estates and tells the story of young Paul Atreides, son of Duke Leto, ruler of House Atreides. For reasons deep-rooted in politics and paranoia, House Atreides have been ordered by the Emperor of the Known Universe to take stewardship of the planet Arrakis, replacing their sworn enemies House Harkonnen. Note: If you're wondering how to see the new movie outside the theaters, check out our \"Dune\" streaming guide for tips on where to watch. Frank Herbert's Dune Saga 3-Book Boxed Set: was $30.97 now $20.98 at Amazon Launch yourself into Frank Herbet's epic saga on the desert planet of Arrakis, where the Spice must flow. This box set, which is 32% off, includes Herbert's iconic Dune novel, as well as Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. Arrakis is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland. However, it is the only source of a spice called Melange, which along with offering many health benefits and enhancing cognitive abilities, it is essential for folding space , the only method that exists of crossing vast interstellar distances. Consequently, this seemingly worthless world is actually the most important planet in the universe. What follows is a multilayered story with interacting elements of politics, religion, ecology, technology and human emotion, as an intergalactic game of chess unfolds in a struggle for survival, the control of Arrakis and the spice. Much like \" Foundation \" currently airing on Apple TV+ , \"Dune\" was considered by many to be unfilmable, or at the very least, extremely difficult. In December 1974, a French consortium purchased the movie rights with the intention of having Alejandro Jodorowsky in the director's chair. Pink Floyd and French progressive rock band Magma were set to provide the music; artists HR Giger, Chris Foss and Jean Giraud had been approached to provide set and character design and an impressive cast was to include Salvador Dal\u00ed, Orson Welles, Gloria Swanson, David Carradine and Mick Jagger. However, despite some concerns over Jodorowsky's ambitious ideas, after two and a half years in development, the project ultimately stalled for financial reasons. There is an incredible documentary called \" Jodorowsky's Dune\" available to watch on Amazon Prime that tells the whole story. Ridley Scott considered having a go in the very early 80s and even got as far as preliminary artwork by HR Giger. However, \"Blade Runner\" wasn't the box office blockbuster the studio's hoped for in 1982, so that was the end of that. Then came David Lynch's \"Dune\" in 1984 , the movie that everyone is comparing this new one too. And that's understandable, because it's the only other cinematic production of Frank Herbert's novel. However, it is essential to remember that these two interpretations of \"Dune\" are exactly that, interpretations, made by two different directors with different visions, some 37 years apart. This absolutely should be looked upon like comparing two different productions of Shakespeare's \"Henry V\" and \"Dune\" is exactly that, science fiction Shakespeare. Lynch's \"Dune\" took nearly three years to produce and also boasted an impressive cast, including Sean Young, Patrick Stewart, Max von Sydow, Jos\u00e9 Ferrer, J\u00fcrgen Prochnow, Dean Stockwell, Francesca Annis and Kyle MacLachlan. This new movie also features an impressive cast, including Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson. Related: 'Dune' reaches space as astronaut celebrates Frank Herbert's iconic sci-fi novel The 1984 movie adopted a different approach; Lynch took some liberties with the story (it doesn't rain on Arrakis at the end of the novel), added the nice-but-not-necessary Weirding Modules and redesigned the whole look and feel of the technology used. Just like how Ridley Scott popularized cyberpunk in \"Blade Runner,\" Lynch did the same for steampunk \u2014 a style that suggests advanced technology actually has older, typically Victorian-era components. This is particularly visible for example, when we see the perspective shot of Paul Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan) from inside the hunter-seeker during an assassination attempt inside his bedchamber. Villeneuve on the other hand, has opted for a more retrotech aesthetic \u2014 similar to the \"Star Wars\" universe , for example \u2014 and it looks beautiful, especially on a big screen, but neither is right or wrong and we love both. Thirty-seven years is a very long time in movie production and both special and visual effects have evolved a great deal, consequently much more is possible today than it was in the early 80s. This is probably most evident with the giant sand worms of Arrakis. In addition to the separate approaches to visual style, there are many other differences between the two interpretations. \"Dune\" really does have the grandeur of a work of Shakespeare and Lynch's movie felt much more theatrical. His movie also utilized voiceover narration and straightaway the absence of this is felt in this 2021 adaptation. Again, this has pros and cons. Once again using the hunter-seeker assassination attempt in Paul's bedchamber as an example; we hear Kyle MacLachlan's inner voice providing exposition about how the suspensor field will make it slippery underneath. It adds to the scene without spoon-feeding the audience any information to assist the flow of the story. Villeneuve does away with that completely. Instead, he relies much more on the use of dramatic incidental music and instrumental montages to build the tension in the scene. And it's done very well. Both significantly different approaches are equally successful in creating an effective set piece. The new movie also dramatically reduces the screen time of Dr Yueh (played by Chen Chang and Dean Stockwell in the 1984 movie). Again, there are both pros and cons to this, but mostly cons. In Lynch's movie, the strong relationship and respect Duke Leto and Lady Jessica have with Yueh is steadily built upon, thus making his betrayal \u2014 and the breaking of his imperial conditioning \u2014 so much more significant. However, it does set him up as the prime suspect to be \"the traitor\" that Baron Vladimir Harkonnen refers to earlier in the story. In Villeneuve's version, his character is hardly seen, so while we don't suspect him at all, because he's hardly said two words, the magnitude of his Marcus Brutus-style betrayal is totally missed. Also, Stockwell gives an Academy Award-level performance when he's finally murdered by Piter de Vries (Brad Dourif). Sadly, Chang does not. On the flipside, Villeneuve's movie considerably increases the screentime and story of Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa). Poor Richard Jordan was spectacularly underused in Lynch's film. However, both movies didn't show the set-piece death scene of Dr. Liet Kynes, played by Max von Sydow in 1984. The role has been regendered for the 2021 movie and is played by Sharon Duncan-Brewster, but Liet Kynes is the father of Chani, so perhaps this is her mother instead. In the book, Kynes is badly beaten by the Harkonnens during the attack on Arrakeen and is taken to the deep desert, without a stillsuit, to die. He begins to hallucinate and has an imaginary conversation with his father before being swallowed by the desert in a spice blow . It's a beautiful, emotional chapter in the book and Villeneuve pays homage to it by having Kynes swallowed by the desert in the wake of a worm instead, taking a few Sardaukar troops with her. Talking of the Sardaukar, we get a brief glimpse of Salusa Secundus in this movie, the home of the feared Sardaukar terror troops and that scores massive points. But interestingly, Villeneuve \u2014 who has chosen to expand many more elements of the story and thus create this two-part story (the runtime of the 1984 movie was 2 hours 17 minutes and this runs at 2 hours 35 minutes) \u2014 has not yet shown the character of Feyd Rautha, famously portrayed by Sting in the Lynch movie. And this is odd as Feyd's story runs parallel to Paul's in the book; he is in essence the anti-Paul. Villeneuve has still made his own modifications to the story; one of the most notable is the rescue of the harvester crew after \u2014 in this version \u2014 the carryall malfunctions. In the novel, the Harkonnens had managed to overpower the crew of the carryall and in Lynch's movie, it's assumed they had destroyed it. This is an important set piece in the story as Kynes begins to admire Duke Leto, against all better judgment. It also contributes to the gradual, continuing thread that suggests the Harkonnen threat on Arrakis is still very real. But the malfunction feels forced and there was really no need to make this alteration. Moreover, Oscar Isaac just does not have the forcefulness that J\u00fcrgen Prochnow does as he shouts, \"You men, run! RUN!\" Here's the thing; any movie that is a part of a larger story, should still be able to stand up on its own \u2026 and I'm not sure if this does. It has very obviously been written with part two in mind and the choice to end where it did \u2014 before Paul embarks on the next chapter of his life and begins fulfilling the prophecy \u2014 is an interesting one. Basically there's no third act. Lynch's \"Dune\" had so many memorable scenes and lines delivered with seldom-seen panache, that are so quotable, even now. From just about anything Everett McGill (Stilgar) says to Patrick Stewart, leading a counterattack, holding a pug and shouting, \"Long live Duke Leto!\" Yet, very little will stand out in this movie in the same way, sadly. The dialogue is written in a much more casual, conversation-like manner and despite a great cast and good performances \u2014 the most notable probably Charlotte Rampling (Reverend Mother Mohiam) and Dave Bautista (Beast Rabban Harkonnen) \u2014 nothing was particularly stand out. With one or two small exceptions, this movie follows a similar story to Lynch's, but it really skews away after the Harkonnen attack on Arakeen. It almost feels at times as if decisions were made to make it deliberately stand apart form the 1984 version, to make it possible to love both movies. Once you've got past the way \"Harkonnen\" is pronounced, it's enjoyable. There's a really interesting angle taken at the beginning at the movie, which is very indicative of the times in which we live, as we hear from Chani's (Zendaya) perspective of all the times Arrakis has been occupied and the Fremen have been hunted. Villeneuve has opted for much more Middle East-feel to the set design, rather than the colonial aesthetic Lynch went for. However, both work well and the 2021 movie pays homage to the source novel since there are a great many Persian influences in the book. \"Dune\" is a good movie and, like Lynch's, it has its ups and its downs, but is it Villeneuve's film best so far? No. That was \" Blade Runner 2049 \" without a single shadow of doubt. Could this version of \"Dune\" be better, yes. Could \"Blade Runner 2049\"? No, that's a perfect film. Denis Villeneuve hasn't put his stamp on this movie as much as fans of his work would've liked to see. If this was a school report, it would say something like, \"We know Denis can do better and while his work continues to be among the best in his class, we believe he can accomplish more.\" At the time of writing, \"Dune\" has opened in the US with $40 million USD. That's the best ever for director Denis Villeneuve, which is great news and there's no reason whatsoever that part 2 should not be given the green light. Incidentally, at $165m, \"Dune\" was $35 million cheaper to make than \"Jungle Cruise\"\u2026 let that sink in. Follow Scott Snowden on Twitter . Follow us on Twitter @Spacedotcom and on Facebook .",

    "full_description": "Sudan has been rocked by a coup d\u2019etat, with the Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok arrested and at least three people killed on Monday. General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan is now the de facto leader of the country and has declared a state of emergency. Soldiers have rounded up civilian leaders and forces have moved to crush furious protesters. General Burhan announced in a televised address that armed forces had detained government leaders who had been leading the transition to full civilian rule after autocrat Omar al-Bashir was removed from power in April 2019. Mr Bashir ruled Sudan with an iron fist for three decades. He is currently in jail in Khartoum and is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of genocide during civil war in Darfur. \u201cTo rectify the revolution\u2019s course, we have decided to declare a state of emergency nationwide \u2026 dissolve the transitional sovereign council, and dissolve the cabinet,\u201d General Burhan said, who announced the formation of a new government. Clashes erupted in the capital Khartoum after his speech, with the information ministry saying that soldiers had \u201cfired live bullets on protesters rejecting the military coup outside the army headquarters\u201d. Three protesters were killed and some 80 people wounded as \u201cforces of the military council coup\u201d opened fire to put down the furious demonstrations against the military, according to the independent Central Committee of Sudan Doctors. \u201cCivilian rule is the people\u2019s choice,\u201d demonstrators chanted. \u201cNo to military rule.\u201d Some waved flags and used tyres to create burning barricades. \u2018Autocracy back on the menu\u2019 UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres denounced the military takeover and called for leaders to be freed. \u201cI condemn the ongoing military coup in Sudan,\u201d Mr Guterres said. \u201cPrime Minister Hamdok and all other officials must be released immediately.\u201d Mr Hamdok had previously described splits in the transitional government as the \u201cworst and most dangerous crisis\u201d facing the transition. Internet services were cut across the country and roads into Khartoum shut, before soldiers stormed the headquarters of Sudan\u2019s state broadcaster in the capital\u2019s twin city of Omdurman, the information ministry said. \u00e2\u009a \u00ef\u00b8\u008f Confirmed: Internet disrupted in #Sudan amid reports of military coup and detention of Prime Minister; real-time network data show national connectivity at 34% of ordinary levels; incident ongoing \u00f0\u009f\u0093\u0089 \u00f0\u009f\u0093\u00b0 Live Report: https://t.co/uVVZKchH5S pic.twitter.com/SoyZK2uYQ9 Under a 2019 power-sharing deal after the ousting of Bashir, Sudan is ruled by a sovereign council of civilian and military representatives tasked with overseeing a transition to a full civilian government. But in recent weeks the cracks in the leadership had grown wide. Jonas Horner, from the International Crisis Group think tank, called it an \u201cexistential moment for both sides\u201d. \u201cThis kind of intervention \u2026 really puts autocracy back on the menu,\u201d he said. The power grab by the army was condemned by the international community, with the European Union calling for the \u201cfast release\u201d of the civilian leadership, and the African Union and Arab League also expressing concern. US Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Jeffrey Feltman said Washington was \u201cdeeply alarmed at reports of a military takeover of the transitional government\u201d. And UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet warned Sudan risked returning to oppression. \u201cIt would be disastrous if Sudan goes backwards after finally bringing an end to decades of repressive dictatorship,\u201d Ms Bachelet said. Ahmed Soliman, an analyst from Britain\u2019s Chatham House think tank, said a military takeover could jeopardise critical donor support for already economically struggling Sudan. \u201cSudan\u2019s international partners have made clear all along that their continued engagement is contingent on the political transition moving forward,\u201d Mr Soliman said. Protest calls In recent days, rival protests have been held, with sit-ins outside the presidential palace demanding a return to \u201cmilitary rule\u201d, and in response, tens of thousands marched to back the full transfer of power to civilians. The two sides represent opposing factions of the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC), the civilian umbrella group which spearheaded demonstrations that led to the overthrow of Bashir. Tensions between the two sides have long simmered, but divisions flared up after a failed coup on September 21 this year. The developments come two days after the mainstream FFC leader Yasser Arman warned of a \u201ccreeping coup\u201d, at a news conference in Khartoum that was attacked by an unidentified mob. On Monday, the mainstream FFC appealed for nationwide \u201ccivil disobedience\u201d. The Sudanese Professionals Association, an umbrella group of trade unions which were key in leading the 2019 anti-Bashir protests, denounced what it called a \u201cmilitary coup\u201d and urged demonstrators \u201cto fiercely resist\u201d it. Protesters were seen marching through the streets of Khartoum carrying the Sudanese flag. \u201cWe will not accept military rule, and we are ready to give our lives for the democratic transition in Sudan,\u201d demonstrator Haitham Mohamed said. \u201cWe will not leave the streets until the civilian government is back,\u201d Sawsan Bashir, another protester, told AFP.

University of Missouri\u2013St. Louis reader comments 43 with 32 posters participating Share this story Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit The cybersecurity professor who helped uncover the Missouri government's failure to protect teachers' Social Security numbers has demanded that the state cease its investigation into him and stop making \"baseless accusations\" that he committed a crime. As we reported on October 14 , Missouri Gov. Mike Parson threatened to prosecute and seek civil damages from a St. Louis Post-Dispatch journalist who identified a security flaw that exposed the Social Security numbers of teachers and other school employees. The state is also investigating Shaji Khan, a cybersecurity professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis who helped the Post-Dispatch journalist verify the security vulnerability. This is all happening despite the fact that the state government made teachers' Social Security numbers available in an unencrypted form in the HTML source code of a publicly accessible website. The governor's strategy of blaming those who discovered the flaw earned him widespread mockery on social media from people who are familiar with the standard \"view source\" function present in major web browsers. Khan hired an attorney to defend himself against the state's accusations. On Thursday last week, Khan's attorney sent a litigation hold and demand letter to Parson and several state agencies. The letter says that Parson and other state officials defamed Khan and violated his First Amendment \"right to speak freely without the threat of government retaliation.\" The letter adds the Show Me State's investigation into Khan \"would violate the prohibition on malicious prosecution.\" \"Professor Khan is likely to prevail on the merits of any case brought against him,\" the letter said. \"No statute in Missouri or on the federal level prohibits members of the general public from viewing publicly available websites or viewing the website's unencrypted source code. No reasonable person would think they were unauthorized to view a publicly available website, its unencrypted source code, or any of the unencrypted translations of that source code. There is no probable cause to investigate Professor Khan, and instigation or continuation of any proceeding against him would therefore be prohibited.\" Advertisement SSNs sent \u201cto every visitor to the website\u201d The letter notes that Post-Dispatch reporter Josh Renaud asked Khan to verify the security flaw in a Missouri government website that allowed the public to search teacher certifications and credentials. \"Professor Khan agreed to verify whether the security flaw existed only if Mr. Renaud agreed not to publish any story until the State of Missouri had an opportunity to protect teachers' sensitive information if a flaw was in fact present. Mr. Renaud agreed,\" the letter said. The security flaw was easy to confirm, the letter says: The public website permitted visitors to look up the credentials of Missouri teachers. Users could look up teachers by school assignments or by their last names and last four digits of their Social Security numbers. However, due to a major security flaw present in its design, the website was programmed to send the full Social Security number of Missouri teachers to every visitor to the website, whether the visitor was aware or not. That information was also programmed to be automatically stored in the visitors' web browsers... On October 11-12, 2021, Professor Khan verified the security flaw. He did so by: Visiting the public website, which was accessible by anyone and did not require a login; Looking at the publicly available source code, which can be easily done by anyone on any webpage under the \"View\" menu option; Identifying a suspicious piece of the source code referred to as \"View State\" that can contain security flaws like the one found here; and Translating the source code into plain text, which can also be done by anyone. This entire process could be completed by anyone in a matter of just a few minutes. None of the data was encrypted, no passwords were required, and no steps were taken by the State of Missouri to protect the Social Security numbers of its teachers that the State automatically sent to every website visitor. The website is still \"down for maintenance.\" Khan: The only crimes were committed by the state Khan's letter calls for an investigation into the state government, saying the government violated a Missouri law that prohibits state entities from publicly disclosing Social Security numbers. The state also violated a state law requiring government officials to provide accurate information to victims of data breaches, the letter said: Here, the State of Missouri and its officials improperly published Social Security numbers of approximately 100,000 teachers online. Instead of informing teachers of the nature of their failure, Missouri officials chose to minimize the security flaw created by the State and publicly blame the individuals who responsibly reported the problem to the proper authorities. The government has a responsibility to follow the law and provide accurate information to the teachers it failed. It did not and still has not, and the government has therefore violated the law. On October 13, the Missouri Office of Administration issued a press release claiming that a \"hacker\" accessed the Social Security numbers of teachers. This characterization is \"false,\" Khan's letter said. \"The State of Missouri automatically transmitted teacher Social Security numbers to every website visitor. No one who discovered and reported this security flaw attempted to gain unauthorized access to or 'hack' the website.\"",

    "full_description": "A team of international researchers led by the University of Arizona reported last year that they had uncovered the largest and oldest Maya monument\u2014Aguada F\u00e9nix. That same team has now uncovered nearly 500 smaller ceremonial complexes that are similar in shape and features to Aguada F\u00e9nix. The find transforms previous understanding of Mesoamerican civilization origins and the relationship between the Olmec and the Maya people. The team's findings are detailed in a new paper published in the journal Nature Human Behavior . UArizona anthropology professor Takeshi Inomata is the paper's first author. His UArizona coauthors include anthropology professor Daniela Triadan and Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Lab director Greg Hodgins. Using data gathered through an airborne laser mapping technique called lidar, the researchers identified 478 complexes in the Mexican states of Tabasco and Veracruz. Lidar penetrates the tree canopy and reflects three-dimensional forms of archaeological features hidden under vegetation. The lidar data was collected by the Mexican governmental organization Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda and covered a 32,800-square-mile area, which is about the same size as the island of Ireland. Publicly available lidar data allows researchers to study huge areas before they follow up with high-resolution lidar to study sites of interest in greater detail. \"It was unthinkable to study an area this large until a few years ago,\" Inomata said. \"Publicly available lidar is transforming archaeology.\" Missing Links? There's a longstanding debate over whether the Olmec civilization led to the development of the Maya civilization or if the Maya developed independently. The newly uncovered sites are located in a broad area encompassing the Olmec region and the western Maya lowlands. The complexes were likely constructed between 1100 B.C. and 400 B.C. and were built by diverse groups nearly a millennium before the heyday of the Maya civilization between A.D. 250 and 950. The researchers found that the complexes share similar features with the earliest center in the Olmec area, San Lorenzo, which peaked between 1400 and 1100 BC. Aguada Fenix in the Maya area and other related sites began to adopt San Lorenzo's form and formalize it around 1100 BC. At San Lorenzo, the team also found a previously unrecognized rectangular space. \"The sites are big horizontally but not vertically,\" Inomata said. \"People will be walking on one and won't notice its rectangular space, but we can see it with lidar really nicely.\" The researchers' work suggests that San Lorenzo served as a template for later constructions, including Aguada F\u00e9nix. \"People always thought San Lorenzo was very unique and different from what came later in terms of site arrangement,\" Inomata said. \"But now we show that San Lorenzo is very similar to Aguada F\u00e9nix\u2014it has a rectangular plaza flanked by edge platforms. Those features become very clear in lidar and are also found at Aguada F\u00e9nix, which was built a little bit later. This tells us that San Lorenzo is very important for the beginning of some of these ideas that were later used by the Maya.\" Sites Were Likely Ritual Spaces The sites uncovered by Inomata and his collaborators were likely used as ritual gathering sites, according to the paper. They include large central open spaces where lots of people could gather and participate in rituals. The researchers also analyzed each site's orientation and found that the sites seem to be aligned to the sunrise of a certain date, when possible. \"There are lots of exceptions; for example, not every site has enough space to place the rectangular form in a desired direction, but when they can, they seem to have chosen certain dates,\" Inomata said. While it's not clear why the specific dates were chosen, one possibility is that they may be tied to Zenith passage day, which is when the sun passes directly overhead. This occurs on May 10 in the region where the sites were found. This day marks the beginning of the rainy season and the planting of maize. Some groups chose to orient their sites to the directions of the sunrise on days 40, 60, 80 or 100 days before the zenith passage day. This is significant because the later Mesoamerican calendars are based on the number 20. San Lorenzo, Aguada F\u00e9nix and some other sites have 20 edge platforms along the eastern and western sides of the rectangular plaza. Edge platforms are mounds placed along the edges of the large rectangular plazas. They define the shape of the plazas, and each are usually no taller than about 3 feet. \"This means that they were representing cosmological ideas through these ceremonial spaces,\" Inomata said. \"In this space, people gathered according to this ceremonial calendar.\" Inomata stressed that this is just the beginning of the team's work. \"There are still lots of unanswered questions,\" he said. Researchers wonder what the social organization of the people who built the complexes looked like. San Lorenzo possibly had rulers, which is suggested by sculptures. \"But Aguada F\u00e9nix doesn't have those things,\" Inomata said. \"We think that people were still somehow mobile, because they had just begun to use ceramics and lived in ephemeral structures on the ground level. People were in transition to more settled lifeways, and many of those areas probably didn't have much hierarchical organization. But still, they could make this kind of very well-organized center.\" Inomata's team and others are still searching for more evidence to explain these differences in social organization. \"Continuing to excavate the sites to find these answers will take much longer,\" Inomata said, \"and will involve many other scholars.\" Explore further",

    "full_description": "For lumber companies, the American chestnut was a nearly perfect tree\u2014tall, straight, rot-resistant and easy to split. It also was prolific, sending up new shoots that grew quickly. In the early 1900s, the species made up a substantial portion of eastern hardwood forests. There were nearly four billion American chestnut trees in the United States, each growing up to 100 feet, with trunks four to seven feet thick. Healthy trees lived for 400 to 600 years, producing several bushels of nuts every year. Today, however, it can be difficult to find a healthy American chestnut. A fungal pathogen on trees imported from Japan and China wiped the species out in less than 40 years. That loss is considered to be the greatest ecological disaster to ever strike the world's forests. \"The pathogen is native to Chinese and Japanese chestnuts, so the two co-evolved,\" said Emily Dobry, a Penn State Behrend graduate now in Penn State's plant sciences horticulture master's-degree program. She is doing research work at the University's Lake Erie Regional Grape Research and Extension Center (LERGREC) in North East. \"The American chestnut had never been exposed to it before, however, so it had little natural resistance. Think of it as smallpox for trees.\" Today, there are fewer than 1,000 American chestnut trees, largely in isolated areas outside of the tree's historical range in the eastern half of the United States, along the Appalachian mountain ridge and throughout New England. A few can be found at LERGREC, where researchers have been conducting a trial since 2013 with 15 chestnut trees\u2014five each of the American, Chinese, and American-Chinese hybrid species developed by scientists, all planted in one long row. \"The idea was to plant American and Chinese chestnuts side by side with some of the hybrids that have been developed, and to allow them to be challenged with chestnut blight over the years,\" said Bryan Hed, a plant pathologist at LERGREC. \"Most of the trees have suffered dieback from disease, insects or weather and have had to be cut back and renewed,\" he said. \"The hybrid trees are notable exceptions: Three of them are currently 17 to 21 feet in height.\" Trees are renewed using sucker growth from the original rootstock. \"The American chestnut is now designated as 'functionally extinct,'\" which means that although the species still technically survives, it cannot reproduce,\" Dobry said. \"The shoots rarely grow large enough to produce nuts, and therefore, future generations.\" The most promising hope for the American chestnut now is probably transgenic\u2014the development of a genetically modified tree. Scientists are trying to engineer a tree that is as close to an American chestnut as possible, with just enough genetic material from the Chinese chestnut to resist the blight. \"Researchers have developed partially blight-resistant transgenic American chestnuts that are capable of surviving infection from the pathogen that causes blight,\" Dobry said. \"It doesn't kill the pathogen; it's still present, but it doesn't destroy the tree.\" The current balance of species in U.S. forests could pose another problem as scientists try to reintroduce the American chestnut: The oak tree has risen to fill its place. \"It will be a challenge for the American chestnut to establish itself into the forest ecosystem again, \"Dobry said. The American chestnut could bring other problems to the forest. In 2018, while working as an undergraduate researcher at LERGREC, Dobry discovered a fungus that was atypical for the American chestnut species. \"Initially, we assumed this was an unusual presentation of chestnut blight infection,\" she said, \"but after taking samples and doing research, we did not find blight , but a pathogen commonly known as chestnut brown rot. At the time, there had been no published report of this fungus in our hemisphere.\" Dobry continues to study the domestically isolated strain, examining whether it may be harmful to species of trees closely related to the chestnut, such as oaks. \"If this fungus proves pathogenic to oak, it could be another blow to forest dynamics,\" she said. \"That's why the chestnut project and others like it are so important to protect the diversity and future of our forests.\" Explore further",

    "full_description": "No matter how bad conditions appear on the surface, it's even more treacherous below. That's the disturbing takeaway from the Facebook Papers , a collection of internal Facebook documents leaked by whistleblower Frances Haugen and reviewed by 17 news organizations. Their stories paint a picture of a company broken beyond repair, that, despite scandal after scandal , still has the power to shock. A small taste of that reporting, summed up below, proves just how bad the situation truly is. The people who work at Facebook are not a monolith, and the Atlantic reports that company documents show some employees calling out real-world harm caused by the platform \u2014 only to be brushed aside by higher-ups. \"How are we expected to ignore when leadership overrides research based policy decisions to better serve people like the groups inciting violence today,\" a Facebook staffer wrote in the fallout of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol . \"Rank and file workers have done their part to identify changes to improve our platform but have been actively held back. \" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn't want to be in the business of censoring political speech, he has repeatedly insisted . And yet, according to the Washington Post , he's personally done just that when it suits his company's bottom line. The Post highlights a particular nasty example of the CEO's duplicity in Vietnam, where, according to people familiar with the decision, Zuckerberg himself made the call to censor anti-government posts on behalf of the ruling Communist Party in 2020. Vietnam is an important market for Facebook. A 2018 Amnesty International estimate found Facebook earned approximately US$1 billion in annual revenue from the country. That the Facebook algorithm amplifies divisive content is now a widely understood fact. Even so, the horrific nature of that content still has the power to shock even Facebook's own researchers. \"On Feb. 4, 2019, a Facebook researcher created a new user account to see what it was like to experience the social media site as a person living in Kerala, India,\" reports the New York Times . \"For the next three weeks, the account operated by a simple rule: Follow all the recommendations generated by Facebook's algorithms to join groups, watch videos and explore new pages on the site.\" I've seen more images of dead people in the past three weeks than I've seen in my entire life total. According to internal Facebook documents, the experiment laid bare just how skewed Facebook's recommendation systems are. \"Following this test user's News Feed, I've seen more images of dead people in the past three weeks than I've seen in my entire life total,\" wrote the Facebook researcher. Reporting has shown that Zuckerberg feared the wrath of Facebook's conservative users , and thus would personally intervene on behalf of right-wing pundits and publishers. Leaked documents contained in the Facebook Papers and highlighted by Politico show that even Facebook's own researchers were aware of this, and repeatedly called it out internally. \"Facebook routinely makes exceptions for powerful actors when enforcing content policy,\" wrote a Facebook data scientist in a 2020 internal presentation titled Political Influences on Content Policy . \"The standard protocol for enforcement and policy involves consulting Public Policy on any significant changes, and their input regularly protects powerful constituencies.\" Notably, as Politico points out, the Public Policy team referred to by the researcher includes Facebook lobbyists. What's more, Facebook researchers confirmed that Zuckerberg himself often got involved in deciding whether a post should stay or go \u2014 suggesting a two-tier system of enforcement dependent on unwritten rules. Human traffickers have used Facebook's tools to power their work. As CNN reports , a 2020 internal Facebook document made clear that Facebook was long aware of this fact. \"[Our] platform enables all three stages of the human exploitation lifecycle (recruitment, facilitation, exploitation) via complex real-world networks,\" reads the internal Facebook report in part. And yet, while human trafficking has long been explicitly banned on Facebook, it took Apple threatening to boot Facebook and Instagram from the Apple App Store in 2019 for Facebook to muster the type of response one might have expected much earlier. \"Removing our applications from Apple platforms would have had potentially severe consequences to the business, including depriving millions of users of access to IG & FB,\" reads the document reviewed by CNN. \"To mitigate against this risk, we formed part of a large working group operating around the clock to develop and implement our response strategy.\" SEE ALSO: Facebook announces US$50 million distraction Importantly, Apple wasn't the first to bring the issue to Facebook's attention. \"Was this issue known to Facbeook [sic] before the BBC enquiry and Apple escalation?\" the internal Facebook report asks. \"Yes.\"",

    "pubDate": "2021-10-25 20:00:04",
    "full_description": "A new supernova captured by the Hubble Space Telescope may act as a decoder for other star explosions. Given that the telescope caught the star so early in its \"cataclysmic demise,\" as NASA called it, astronomers say the research may eventually help them formulate an early warning system for other stars that might be about to explode. Scientists are dubbing the event, known as SN 2020fqv, as the \"Rosetta Stone of supernovas.\" That's a reference to the Rosetta Stone , which has the same text written in three different scripts, allowing historians to read Egyptian hieroglyphs. (The stone was inscribed in ancient Greek, which was well-known to scholars, as well as two forms of Egyptian script, which were then poorly understood.) The actual stone, dating from about 2,200 years ago, was found by accident in 1799 by soldiers in Napoleon's army campaigning in Egypt; you can see it today in the British Museum in London. Investigators for the Hubble discovery admitted the term \"Rosetta Stone\" is used often as a metaphor for deciphering information, but noted the term is an apt description for the importance of this new cosmic work. Related : The best Hubble Space Telescope images of all time! \"This is the first time we've been able to verify the mass with these three different methods for one supernova, and all of them are consistent,\" lead author Samaporn Tinyanont, a graduate student in astronomy at California Institute of Technology, said in a NASA statement . \"Now we can push forward using these different methods and combining them, because there are a lot of other supernovas where we have masses from one method but not another.\" SN 2020fqv was found amid the Butterfly galaxies, a pair of spiral galaxies located roughly 60 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Virgo. The supernova was first discovered in April 2020 by the Zwicky Transient Facility at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego, California. Coincidentally, the supernova was also in the view of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), whose primary mission is to search for relatively nearby planets outside of our solar system. Soon, Hubble and several ground-based telescopes joined the multinational observatory star party. \u2014 Hubble captures gorgeous image of 'Einstein ring' from warped quasar light \u2014 Hubble telescope captures striking image of a dying galaxy \u2014 Astronomers turn back time to solve Einstein ring mystery Hubble's sharp eyes allowed the observatory to look at the material close by the star, known as circumstellar material, only a few hours after the explosion occurred. Because the material clung onto the star until the last year of its life, astronomers say studying this stuff allows further research into what the star was doing before it died. \"We rarely get to examine this very close-in circumstellar material since it is only visible for a very short time, and we usually don't start observing a supernova until at least a few days after the explosion,\" Tinyanont said. \"For this supernova, we were able to make ultra-rapid observations with Hubble, giving unprecedented coverage of the region right next to the star that exploded.\" Helpfully, Hubble also has an archive of observations of this star dating to the 1990s. Astronomers probed the image series and added TESS observations of the system every 30 minutes in the days before the explosion, as well as during the explosion itself and for a few more weeks (before, we assume, the standard schedule of TESS shifted the telescope to gaze at another spot in the sky.) Scientists then calculated the mass of the exploding star using three different methods: comparing observations with theoretical models, using information from a 1997 archival image of Hubble (this was to rule out higher-mass stars in the model), and measuring the amount of oxygen in the supernova, which is a proxy for mass. All three methods produced consistent results, with an estimate of 14 to 15 times the mass of our own sun. One of the more famous unstable stars is Betelgeuse, a red supergiant that is late in its life and put up some antics in the last year or so. Co-author Ryan Foley, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said he doesn't believe Betelgeuse itself is about to explode, but added that SN 2020fqv will help in building our database of stars to watch. \"This could be a warning system,\" Foley said of the explosion behavior Hubble and other observatories noted. \"So if you see a star start to shake around a bit, start acting up, then maybe we should pay more attention and really try to understand what's going on there before it explodes. As we find more and more of these supernovae with this sort of excellent data set, we'll be able to understand better what's happening in the last few years of a star's life.\" A paper based on the research was published Thursday (Oct. 21) in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

    "full_description": "Astronomers at the Chandra X-ray Observatory just announced that they might have identified an exoplanet in another galaxy for the first time ever. The possible exoplanet candidate was spotted in the spiral galaxy Messier 51 (M51), according to a statement by the observatory . The observatory was monitoring X-rays coming from a binary star system in M51 when they saw dimming in the X-ray source, a strong indication of a planetary transit. \"We are trying to open up a whole new arena for finding other worlds by searching for planet candidates at X-ray wavelengths, a strategy that makes it possible to discover them in other galaxies,\" said Rosanne Di Stefano, from Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institute's Center for Astrophysics and the lead author of the study published today in Nature Astronomy. The system itself isn't any old star system though. Astronomers suspect that the X-rays are the product of either a neutron star or even a black hole that is feeding off its partner star, making this planet even more intriguing. Thousands of possible exoplanets have been spotted in our own galaxy, and over 150 have been confirmed. The most common method for identifying exoplanet candidates is the transit method, which is when you look at the amount of light being radiated by a star and watch for dips in the star's brightness. This would indicate that something passed in front of the light source, and if there is a regular period to the dips in the light seen from the star and the dip is of same magnitude, then you can confirm that there is a planet in orbit around that star. The exoplanet candidate spotted in M51 was seen in the same way, only instead of using visible light as with our current transit method for stars nearer to us, this method used X-ray emissions instead. The X-ray emissions are coming from either a neutron star or a black hole orbiting a larger star in a binary system. The companion star is estimated to have about 20 times the mass of the sun and is feeding the accretion disk around its partner, which is emitting the X-rays that the astronomers were able to observe. During their observation, they saw the X-ray emissions stop entirely for about 3 hours, which \u2013 along with other data \u2013 could indicate a Saturn-sized planet transiting in front of X-ray source at a distance of about twice Saturn's distance from the sun. This was only the first diminution of X-rays spotted though, so its too soon to say whether this is a planet or not \u2013 and confirmation could take decades. The researchers calculated that the planet's orbital period would be about 70 years, based on its size and distance. \"Unfortunately to confirm that we're seeing a planet we would likely have to wait decades to see another transit,\" said Nia Imara, of the University of California at Santa Cruz and co-author of the study. \"And because of the uncertainties about how long it takes to orbit, we wouldn't know exactly when to look.\" While exciting in itself, this new method of detecting planetary transits in binary systems offers another method for spotting exoplanets here in our own galaxy. Since the X-ray emitting region of an accretion disk in these systems is small, a planet could completely block the X-ray source entirely, which is a much clearer indicator of a transit than measuring often subtle changes in the luminosity of a star. It should also be said that the planets spotted using this method would also have suffered through some pretty turbulent times. The collapse of a star into a neutron star or black hole isn't the most peaceful of transitions, and the the supernova that created them would have blasted the planet with some extreme radiation levels that would almost certainly stripped it of any life that might have been living on it. Then there's also the matter of the other star in the system. It hasn't gone supernova yet, but the steady loss of its material to its companion means that its demise is accelerating, so it would only be a matter of time before it too went supernova, blasting the planet again. Life in these systems is highly unlikely to say the least. Still, the X-ray transit method could prove useful in growing our catalog of planets outside our solar system.",

    "description": "Not every classic 3D game works in VR, but RE4 sure does.",
    "content": "Enlarge / This faked perspective of Resident Evil 4's monsters coming at you implies that playing the new VR version will make your VR lenses crack. Ars Technica can verify that this is not actually the case\u2014and even better, after applying some manual, \"developer mode\" toggles, the game is quite good. (credit: Capcom / Facebook) After testing Thursday's virtual reality launch of Resident Evil 4 (RE4VR), which is currently an Oculus Quest exclusive, I found myself equally impressed and puzzled. As the roughly 4,000th port of RE4 since the game's original 2005 launch, this new version manages to establish itself as the action-horror classic's best version. It's absolutely the one new and old players should gravitate toward\u2014even if it's missing a few crucial elements. But as of press time, our recommendation comes with some asterisks, so this is both a review and a technical guide. Facebook may sell the Oculus Quest as a simple, \"set-and-forget\" path to VR, but in the case of RE4VR, I recommend going through some complicated steps to make the game far more playable on its target platform of the Quest 2\u2014and explain the iffy method to unlock the game's compatibility with the Quest 1. It's not clear why Facebook, Capcom, and porting studio Armature didn't straighten all this out for average customers in the first place. Investigating the Quest 1 restriction Armature and Capcom's official screens from the game are cropped to look better on a desktop monitor and are slightly sweetened visually.

    "full_description": "Enlarge / This faked perspective of Resident Evil 4 's monsters coming at you implies that playing the new VR version will make your VR lenses crack. Ars Technica can verify that this is not actually the case\u2014and even better, after applying some manual, \"developer mode\" toggles, the game is quite good. Capcom / Facebook reader comments 5 with 5 posters participating Share this story Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit After testing Thursday's virtual reality launch of Resident Evil 4 (RE4VR), currently an Oculus Quest exclusive, I found myself equally impressed and puzzled. As the roughly 4,000th port of RE4 since the game's original 2005 launch, this new version manages to establish itself as the action-horror classic's best version. New and old players should give this one a try\u2014even if it's missing a few crucial elements. But as of press time, our recommendation comes with some asterisks, so this is both a review and a technical guide. Facebook may sell the Oculus Quest as a simple \"set-and-forget\" path to VR, but in the case of RE4VR , I recommend going through some complicated steps to make the game far more playable on its target platform of the Quest 2\u2014and I'll explain the iffy method to unlock the game's compatibility with the Quest 1. It's unfortunate that Facebook, Capcom, and porting studio Armature didn't straighten all this out for average customers in the first place. Investigating the Quest 1 restriction Enlarge / Armature and Capcom's official screens from the game are cropped to look better on a desktop monitor and are slightly sweetened visually. This one is the most authentic representation of how the game looks on the Quest 2. You can clearly see the original polygonal makeup here. Capcom / Facebook For now, this version of Resident Evil 4 only works on Oculus Quest hardware, not on Windows PCs or PlayStation 4's VR mode. Capcom seems to love locking VR versions of its horror games to specific platforms, as the groundbreaking VR mode in 2017's Resident Evil 7 remains exclusive to PlayStation VR. (Seriously, Capcom? Five years later, and you still haven't ported that wonderful game to a more powerful VR system?) Officially, Facebook limits this week's port even further, as the company only sells the game for its newer Quest 2 platform. If you own only the original 2019 Oculus Quest , you won't find RE4 in any of its native store menus. After I began testing the game's Quest 2 version, I immediately wondered: This restriction can't be technical, can it? The answer came from the game's Quest 1-level specs, particularly its 72 fps frame rate cap and lower-resolution textures. Was this a case of the more powerful Quest 2 requiring some visual downgrades to smoothly run a port of a 2005 GameCube game ? Advertisement Apparently, I wasn't the only person wondering about this, and sadly, I got my answer from pirates, not legitimate game owners. Yep, the game runs just fine on the Oculus Quest 1. My hopes for law-abiding Quest 1 owners to get access to the game began with a guide from the Oculus Quest Reddit community promising \" RE4 on your Quest 1 without piracy .\" The process required a few funky steps. First, by using a Chrome extension, I could log in to my Oculus account to download each of the required files I would need to boot RE4VR on the Quest, all digitally signed with my own account details. Then I enabled \"developer mode\" on my Quest headset. This allowed me to upload those files via a Windows PC to either a Quest 1 or Quest 2 headset. The community-developed Sidequest app remains the easiest way to do so, though I still had to manually place \"APK\" and \"OBB\" files in proper directories. What\u2019re you (not) buyin\u2019? Enlarge / Upon the game's first boot, you're greeted with this handsome \"press a button to start\" 3D zone. Capcom / Facebook Unfortunately, after following all those steps, my digitally signed version of RE4VR wasn't digitally signed enough for Quest 1 hardware. The game began to boot just as it does on Quest 2, only to quit itself after displaying a stern warning: \"Failed to confirm entitlement, game will now exit.\" After asking around, I got a chance to personally test and verify that this week's port of RE4VR indeed boots on Quest 1 systems. What's more, the game runs at an apparently locked 72 fps, albeit with a slightly downgraded image resolution. I couldn't budge the frame rate in my tests while jumping between various save files, whether in the game's first busy, villager-filled shootout or later battles like the harrowing showdown against a lake monster. When asked how they got this version running on Quest 1, my source pointed to a Sidequest upload of \"certain\" files to their Quest 1, then winked. Advertisement My source had an easier time getting their copy of the game to run on Quest 1 than I did. My own copy should have been \"entitled\" enough, but Facebook didn't agree. Having seen the game run fluidly on the Quest 1, I then wondered how much peppier the identical-looking game might run on the Quest 2. Its apparent pixel resolution was higher on the Quest 2, but was there more oomph under that heartier hardware's hood\u2014especially since its screens can technically run as high as 120 Hz? Quest 2 gets Sidequest love, too Enlarge / Glance at your left-hand wristwatch to check your current weapon's ammo while mid-combat. Capcom / Facebook I checked RE4VR 's default menus in search of toggles to frame rates, texture resolutions, or other settings, but there are mostly just control and \"comfort\" options. The same Reddit community pointed to Sidequest as a simple way to force Quest 2 to try a few more tricks. This process also requires toggling developer mode on your Oculus account and connecting Quest hardware to a Windows PC. Sidequest streamlines a few \"ADB\" console commands that you can send to either Quest system, and the Quest 2 can be forced to render games at preferred frame rates and texture resolutions, which can sometimes result in laggy performance, bugs, or outright crashes. In RE4VR 's case, jumping up from 72 Hz to 90 Hz and slightly higher texture resolutions works without a hitch. If the game is exhibiting any animation hitches or bugs with these ADB console commands sent to my Quest 2, I certainly can't perceive them, and I'm particularly sensitive to VR queasiness\u2014so much so, in fact, that RE4VR is an entirely different experience for me with these boosts enabled. Conversely, attempts to run the game at even higher texture resolutions or higher frame rates resulted in more noticeable hitches, suggesting that the Quest 2 has a performance ceiling with this game. (In particular, 120 Hz is a no-go at any setting, based on my uncomfortable tests.) I suggest using Sidequest's \"90 Hz\" and \"1536 texture size\" settings or bumping the texture size even higher to \"2048\" while leaving the refresh rate at the 72 Hz default to gain fidelity at the cost of frame rate.",

The subcommittee\u2019s ranking Republican Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) has signaled that she\u2019s particularly interested in privacy concerns around TikTok. We\u2019d expect topics like eating disorders, harassment, bullying, online safety and data privacy to come up as members of the subcommittee take turns pressing the three policy leads for answers.

    "full_description": "The first time you see a slasher movie , you don\u2019t know that the car won\u2019t start. You\u2019re confused when the main character spots a shady figure outside the window, only to discover in a second glance that they\u2019re no longer there. And you, naive little you, are blown away when the killer survives an attack that seemed more fatal than any of the ones he had inflicted on the jock, the nerd, and the mean girl. Then you see another slasher movie, and then a few more, and then perhaps a hundred more, and you no longer recall a time when those motions felt like fresh inventions. And it\u2019s not just the slashers that rely on these tropes; we\u2019ve all seen a million ghost movies where a figure appears in the background, then \u2014 after the lights flash on then off \u2014 finds its way directly next to the protagonist. Any monster movie (at least, post Jaws ) has the town event that is too important to close down because of a (bear, rabid dog, or even another shark). And you can\u2019t throw a rock in the zombie subgenre without hitting someone who has been bitten but is hiding it from the rest of the group. No matter what your favorite kind of horror movie is, there are a dozen stock moments and narrative beats that appear time and time again. Some recur because they\u2019re unavoidable. Others are just sturdy \u2014 if it ain\u2019t broke, horror people don\u2019t fix it. They haven\u2019t for nearly 100 years. But how do horror tropes work today? How have they evolved? And how do filmmakers use them to their advantage to bring movies closer to that one original feeling of seeing a classic move onscreen for the first time? To size up the tropes, take stock of the stock characters, Polygon asked horror filmmakers, writers, and experts to weigh in on what\u2019s always worked, and what may continue to scare us in the future. \u2014 Brian Collins Amy Searles (co-director, Miskatonic Institute of Horror Studies, Los Angeles): I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all experienced the kind of joke that ebbs and flows upon repetition. Something that\u2019s funny initially can become irritating upon reiteration. But there\u2019s a sweet spot where, if pushed just a little too far, the joke attains a brief period of comedic sublimity, and is funnier than it ever was or had any right to be. In my mind, the horror film equivalent of this rare, heightened state is the mirror scare . Mirrors are ubiquitous and carry no inherent menace. (Unlike garbage disposals \u2014 the Devil\u2019s appliance! \u2014 another, similar horror trope I\u2019m fond of.) In a brightly lit bathroom you may be lulled into a false sense of security when a character opens a mirrored cabinet to fetch an aspirin, only to be met by something marvelously grotesque or threatening that triggers the hero and viewer alike the moment the cabinet door is closed. Todd Farmer (screenwriter Jason X , My Bloody Valentine 3D ): A favorite, without question: Cheap-ass jump scares. They get me every time. Remember that supposed car commercial on the internet with car in the distance winding up a curvy valley? Then a zombie screams and faceplants the screen? Shit meself I did. And that was just a silly internet thing. Of course, there\u2019s a great guff between saying \u201cjump scare\u201d and pulling it off because failure to pull it off means a groan from me and the audience. But when you pull off the lawnmower in Sinister \u2026 you will never be forgotten. Axelle Carolyn (director, The Manor , The Haunting of Bly Manor ): As a fan of ghost stories and \u201970s horror, I\u2019m partial to the emotionally fragile, grieving protagonist who may or may not have just been released from a mental asylum, and finds themself isolated in a countryside house which may or may not be haunted. Jeffrey Reddick (writer, Final Destination ): One of my favorites is how the security goes out at an asylum and a mental patient escapes on the anniversary of the crime they committed. So convenient! Matt Donato (journalist): \u201cThe morgue worker who\u2019s enthusiastically eating while corpses rot on their cold steel tables\u201d gets me every time. Sometimes it\u2019s as simple as sucking on a lollipop, other times the slob gobbles a club sandwich on rye with coleslaw juices oozing everywhere for effect. April Wolfe (screenwriter, Black Christmas 2019): Toilet horror has always been a personal favorite as an adult, but as a kid it totally wrecked me. Just the Ghoulies cover alone left me terrified of using the bathroom at night when I was a kid. Friday the 13th: A New Beginning will always have the best toilet kill, however, because nothing tops Demon and his girlfriend Anita singing while he\u2019s on the crapper because of bad enchiladas. Marc Gottlieb (screenwriter, \u200b\u200b Aquarium of the Dead ): My favorite horror trope is definitely the jumping cat. A feline leaping out of a cupboard, a Dumpster, from the top of a tall cabinet or just about anywhere in a scene that is meant to give the audience a quick, cheap scare. Every time I see it I want to know that cat\u2019s story: What is it doing there? How did it get there? When it works, it really works, like in Friday the 13th Part II just before Adrienne King realizes she won\u2019t be surviving the wrath of two Voorhees family members, or in Alien when Harry Dean Stanton comes across a scared Jonesy before finding something a lot bigger and more deadly. Penny Cox (screenwriter, Scream: The TV Series , Legacies ): I love any version of the ghost that wants to play. Bounce a ball across the room, roll a toy truck, play a clapping game, talk through a Speak & Spell\u2026 Jared Rivet (writer, Jackals , Are You Afraid of the Dark? ): My personal favorite recurring horror is one that\u2019s been around forever but has been showing up in a lot of things lately: In the first act, the lead characters suddenly hit an animal with their car. The roadkill varies from movie to movie, dogs, cats, cows, crows, wolves, coyotes, armadillos, snakes, even, I shit you not, a kangaroo in the case of Long Weekend (1978). But the big winner (loser?) of late seems to be deer. Those suckers just can\u2019t seem to stay out of the path of our unsuspecting, happy-go-lucky horror-movie leads as they innocently cruise ever closer to their doom. It\u2019s a big jolt that no one in the audience sees coming (yeah, right) and it leaves our characters a little shook. Matt Serafini (author, Rites of Extinction ): I\u2019ve got a real soft spot for the Harbinger of Doom. That describes any character who briefly shows up, often drunk, to tell our protagonists they\u2019re about to die. Most notably that\u2019s Crazy Ralph in the first two Friday The 13th movies, but even after he was killed off, the series simply conjured another harbinger to take his place. So right away you got Abel passed out in the middle of the road with an eyeball in his pocket in Friday The 13th Part 3 to continue the tradition in the most nonsensical way imaginable. Harbingers are not relegated to slasher and survival movies, either. Look at the way the pub scene in An American Werewolf In London turns on a dime, from fish-out-of-water awkwardness to \u201choly shit these two guys are in danger,\u201d when the entire bar becomes the voice of doom. Or how the main character in the original Invasion Of The Body Snatchers is himself transformed into the hysterical doomer. Just a great, versatile trope. Brian Collins: What I\u2019ve found with these time-honored story elements is that most of them can be easily adapted to account for changes in technology and the ways we interact with each other today. It used to be easy to get our protagonists lost \u2014 they simply had to take a wrong turn or misguided \u201cshortcut\u201d and end up running afoul of whatever mutant family awaited them. Now everyone has GPS in their phones, and so the trope relies on service going out or the map being uncharted. The result may be the same, but getting there is more identifiable to today\u2019s audiences, and we don\u2019t have to lose a perfectly good narrative device simply because it\u2019s outdated. Luckily, some of them are immune from being dated: a cat jumping out of a cupboard in 1980 is no different than a cat jumping out of a cupboard in 2021. Gottlieb: Dario Argento really doubled down on the trope in Inferno when he hurled something like 11 cats at poor Daria Nicolodi. Reddick: I think these tropes are the nature of the beast with horror films. If people can call for help the movie would be over right away. Sometimes they\u2019re fun to include because you\u2019re giving the audience a little comfort food. But writers do what they can to adjust to the times. So now instead of \u201cthe phone line\u2019s been cut\u201d we get \u201cwe can\u2019t get a signal.\u201d That\u2019s progress. Wolfe: I honestly don\u2019t think filmmakers have used the toilet enough! Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s the grossest part of the bathroom, so it\u2019s difficult to make it sexy like the bathtub. But that\u2019s why I appreciate the filmmakers who try. Because sitting on the toilet is the most vulnerable place a human puts themselves multiple times a day. Aronofsky\u2019s Mother ! found a way to evoke the toilet moment from Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s The Conversation and also make it grosser. All that tissue forming in the bowl, the heart that can\u2019t be flushed. The toilet becomes a surreal portal between the real and the imagined. And then there\u2019s Julia Ducournau, who just cannot be torn away from her toilet scenes. Titane\u2019s horrific self-abortion scene on the toilet barely even shows the porcelain. It relies almost solely on performance and sound design, and yet it\u2019s some of the best toilet horror I\u2019ve seen in a while. Serafini: Certainly the last 25 years have become more self-aware. Which means you\u2019ve got The Cabin in the Woods calling blunt attention to tropes with a character actually named Harbinger. More interesting to me, however, is how movies would \u201ctwist\u201d this element in the pre-deconstruction era. Take one of the most disturbing slasher movies in existence, 1981\u2019s The Prowler, which uses the sheriff character as a mixture of possible red herring and resident harbinger, delivering a few grave warnings before exiting the movie to go on a fishing trip and then, surprise, surprise, he turns out to be the killer! Making the doomsaying part of the motivation for killing feels like a natural evolution for that trope. Donato: I feel like food has become infinitely more portable as our lifestyles favor on-the-go urgency, and yet morgue workers still pick such messy meals to savor right around the arrival of another mutilated slasher victim\u2019s body. Rivet: These days we\u2019ve seen more characters becoming distracted drivers looking for (or at) their cell phones. The trope was definitely around in the pre-cell phone days but now that we have a full generation of distracted drivers, it seems to be a \u201cgo-to\u201d trope for horror filmmakers. Farmer: Certainly for the jump scare the quality has improved exponentially. When I got started, back when we used to walk to school 11 miles in the snow, only Dimension and New Line were making scary movies. That changed after Scream but in today\u2019s world every studio and production company makes horror. Which means demand has increased. Which means the talent pool has evolved. I mean, come on, the guy who wrote Zodiac wrote the new Scream . Chris Rock was in a Saw movie with Sam Jackson. Horror talent has not only evolved but the money and tech that goes into horror has evolved. This leaves no excuse for jump scares not to go to 11. Collins: A filmmaker who opts to avoid typical scares is certainly setting a challenge for themselves, and might be painting themselves into a corner if they can\u2019t rely on the proven formulas and beats of whatever sub-genre they\u2019re tackling. Halloween Kills has been criticized for leaving Laurie on the sidelines and giving her heir apparent Allyson too little to do, so the film essentially lacks a traditional \u201cFinal Girl\u201d going through those motions. So is it still a \u201cslasher\u201d? One could argue that by breaking the formula, it ends up denying slasher fans the things they show up for, especially when it\u2019s part of a long running series. Searles: There is a language to cinema. I know it sounds pretentious, but it\u2019s real. I think many tropes are born of a need to satisfy a familiar and easily understood cinematic syntax. But, as with any language, when one becomes conversant, one of its joys is just how malleable it can be. So while some may utilize clich\u00e9s for comfort or convenience, in the hands of a thoughtful, playful filmmaker, the rote can be subverted or reinvigorated. Toying with tropes can be a dangerous gambit, however \u2014 a lot like making puns. Stick the landing and be met with awe (or \u201cAww!\u201d). Fumble and suffer the groans. Serafini: Holistically, I think a lot of this stuff just comes out of the creative process. When you\u2019ve got characters fumbling around in the woods, does it really make the movie any better if the flashlight doesn\u2019t go out? Is it scarier if the call does connect? I\u2019m not saying filmmakers and writers shouldn\u2019t try and think a bit outside the box these days, I\u2019m just saying that sometimes it\u2019s worth asking ourselves what we really want from a horror movie, and if we\u2019re willing to accept a few of these tropes in order to get the story underway. Carolyn: Part of the reason clich\u00e9s become clich\u00e9s in the first place is because they work. You can use them a certain amount of times and get the right reaction. But also, for some darn reason, studios/producers love them. So you might want to avoid them (the clich\u00e9s \u2026 and the producers), but someone in development or post will sneak them back up on you. Gottlieb: The trope of a car failing to start when the killer is approaching or a victim making a noise that gives their hiding place away are moments that are immediately relatable and, if done well, amp up tension and deliver a great scene. I don\u2019t think clich\u00e9s themselves are necessarily a bad thing, it\u2019s all about how the filmmaker comes up with their fresh take on portraying any particular clich\u00e9. Wolfe: The common theory for this is that moments that truly scare us become more indelible and etched on the brain. We could forget most of a film over time, but the scenes that scare us will stick in our memories because of hormones and chemicals and the way the brain works. With that in mind, people who\u2019ve seen even a few horror films have already learned these scares. They\u2019ve been primed to expect them. So even the most casual horror fan will be prepared for certain things. I think in filmmaking, you\u2019re always looking for the fastest way to the point of terror, and the fastest method is by getting to that trope to release all those brain chemicals, wiping it to the side, and then offering a new version of it. It doesn\u2019t mean that has to be done. But for mainstream horror, that seems to be the key. Indie and art horror seem to offer more license to buck the tropes, but they\u2019re still there. Everyone uses the toilet! Collins: With so many horror movies being made now thanks to the glut of streaming services needing content \u2014 and horror has always been a safer and cheaper option than any other genre \u2014 it\u2019s becoming harder to surprise audiences. You also have to set yourself apart from the healthy competition, which means luring in the viewers with the promise of something they know they\u2019ll enjoy from experience, but also make it stand out from those things by subverting as many expectations as you can without actively turning off those viewers who may want things to be kept simple and \u201ccomforting\u201d, especially around this time of the year. Finding the fine line between tradition and innovation is something every genre filmmaker has to discover throughout the creative process, from writing, to the actual shooting, and finally the editing. They have to take what\u2019s been proven to work, and then break it just a little. Wolfe: Rewriting tropes was some of my favorite fun stuff with Black Christmas . Because it was mainstream (and technically a remake), we really did have to work a lot of those in, but we had this rare opportunity to poke fun. For instance, I can be a fan of Menstrual Power horror. Carrie is still one of my favorite movies. But in the hands of cis-male filmmakers over the years, a girl getting her period has given me a lot of eye rolls. I do feel that men romanticize menstruation as this magical thing, while people who actually menstruate are in the trenches for five days every month and not seeing it as so magical. That\u2019s one of the reasons why we threw a girl on her period using a Diva Cup into the movie, which was a wink-wink for a lot of women. And then you get a quick shot of it in the end, and honestly we just thought it was hilarious. We got a lot of notes from women who watched it with their male partners who were utterly confused by what was happening, and it\u2019s like, yeah, because menstruation is kind of boring and regular and isn\u2019t some mysterious unspoken ritual. Technological complications forced us to confront the trope of characters calling the cops. Everyone has a cell phone. How do you strand them? Some have to drop their phones. But eventually they\u2019ll get a phone and be able to call for help. So with ours, we expanded the world a little bit. We made it so that when they finally did get through, there\u2019s a reason why no help was coming \u2014 the cops were way too busy with other calls that night \u2014 and that allowed us to do a little misdirection. It\u2019s what I called our \u201c Silence of the Lambs moment.\u201d Farmer: For a genre that was created by old white men it\u2019s not shocking that \u201cfemale\u201d nudity was not only a horror movie clich\u00e9 but a destructive clich\u00e9. I won\u2019t dive into the reasons because anyone reading this likely has the common sense to understand why. While the list of horror movie clich\u00e9s is very long, \u201cfemale\u201d nudity is the only clich\u00e9 that is often demanded on many productions. Look, I\u2019m not against T&A, but to randomly toss nudity into a movie for no reason other than to objectify the actress always seemed like a dick move to me. So in 1999, I wrote zero nudity in my first produced horror screenplay [ Jason X ]. No one really said anything because I think the assumption was that the powers that be would badger an actress into nudity later. And I know that badgering was attempted but it didn\u2019t work. So in the 11th hour I was told I had to add nudity to the third act. I figured if I didn\u2019t do as told someone else would and at least my doing it meant turning it into a self aware joke. Which I did. \u201cSmoke pot and have premarital sex? We love premarital sex!\u201d Years later, I realized this was never a battle I was going to win, but I figured I could at least always justify the nudity, at least in my mind, and thus break the clich\u00e9 of plotless disrobing. I also figured if I, the writer, was going to write nudity for my actress, then I\u2019d better be willing to put my own ass on the line. Thus my bare ass is fully visible in My Bloody Valentine and Drive Angry . In fact, you know that clich\u00e9 where you cut back after a sex scene and you just barely get a glimpse of the male\u2019s ass as he pulls his pants up? Yeah, I didn\u2019t do that. I left that ass out there to hang for a while. Thus to all those men who were used to slobbering over the actresses asked to bare it all, who found themselves extremely uncomfortable gazing upon my glowy white buttocks: Hahaha, fuck you. Gottlieb: The \u201cphone isn\u2019t working\u201d clich\u00e9 has been done to death, but I once had a character who was by herself, and we already established she still had her phone on her. I wanted to do something different than rely on the old tried and true \u201cI\u2019ve got no signal out here\u201d angle, so I had her take out the phone, dial a number, and be met with a recording that her service has been interrupted due to an unpaid bill. It totally worked for her character and I felt it was a relatable moment to the audience. Then she dies moments later. Unfortunately the scene suffered the same fate as it was cut later on. Rivet: I think my ultimate subversion of a clich\u00e9/expected trope in Jackals might have cost us a lot of audience members when all is said and done. I think the audience was waiting for the predictable \u201cturn-the-tables\u201d moment, when the trapped characters figure out the weakness of the killer cult in the third act and get their revenge, but \u2014 spoiler alert! \u2014 that doesn\u2019t happen. Some of the reviews even went so far as to say that they didn\u2019t understand what the point was if the whole situation was hopeless and inevitable from the beginning, but that was kind of the point. Was it a miscalculation on my part? I guess it\u2019s not for me to say. Carolyn: My chapter in the anthology film Tales of Halloween was an exercise in subverting expectations. From the beginning, you know we\u2019re building up to a jump scare \u2014 a trope in itself \u2014 so it was all about playing with the audience\u2019s expectations of when it would happen. So we had Alex Essoe break her cell phone, stall her car, close a bathroom mirror, hear a creepy noise, see a door creak open\u2026 all just to misdirect the viewer so they wouldn\u2019t know when the scare would hit. Reddick: I don\u2019t mind embracing a trope if it doesn\u2019t hurt the story or make the characters seem silly. But I really try to subvert tropes if I can. I started with having a Final Guy in Final Destination . The great thing about tropes is you know what the audience expects to happen, so it\u2019s really fun to try and twist it in some way just to get them jumping. Collins: The new Candyman has a brilliant bit where our heroine is about to enter a dark basement, only to offer a \u201chell no\u201d and go elsewhere. And then it turns out the villain was upstairs anyway, meaning the basement might have been the better choice after all. For someone who has never seen a horror movie before, they\u2019ll be scared with either scenario, but Nia DaCosta knew she needed to get a rise out of the veteran horror fans who have seen a thousand protagonists enter a thousand dark basements. Subverting a trope is a fine way to give weary genre aficionados a reason to perk up and realize that the filmmaker isn\u2019t just playing to the cheap seats \u2014 they are putting in the effort to scare even the most dedicated horror buff, using our familiarity with these beats against us. Serafini: I touched on this earlier with The Prowler , but I was also thinking of the new Candyman while considering this conversation. There is a character in that movie whose purpose feels largely expository, certainly intended to make the main character afraid and aware, but the ending manages to twist their purpose in a really strange and unexpected way. Cox: The horror trope of loud noises at unexpected times has never been my favorite, but I understand why it\u2019s a mainstay of the genre. That said, my favorite scare in David Bruckner\u2019s The Night House turned this trope on its head when the heroine falls asleep with her head in her friend\u2019s lap and in the next moment, is startled awake by cacophonous supernatural chaos. That auditory scare, combined with the heroine\u2019s realization that hours have passed and she\u2019s now all alone in her haunted house, turned a familiar trope into my favorite scare of the year. Searles: When found-footage horror was proving to be a bonanza at the box office, filmmakers began panning for gold with every type of documentary or surveillance footage they could conceive of. This naturally created an influx of shaky footage from many amateur documentarians (the bane of the horror fan with motion sickness!), but it also inundated us with the opposite: the unmoving, unmotivated camera, recording everything that crosses its path passively and without interest. Home security systems, convenience store surveillance cameras, you name it. We became so inured to waiting for something of interest to cross in front of the static camera, that we stopped thinking about what might be behind it. I\u2019m sensitive to spoilers, so I won\u2019t reveal too much, but I will say that Creep (2014) features a sequence where an unmotivated camera moves, and the implications are terrifying. I was lucky enough to see that movie in a theater, and the rolling gasps from the audience as each person was roused from their torpor of found footage desensitization were glorious. Farmer: Malignant comes to mind with this idea but I don\u2019t really want to talk about that, because it\u2019s too new and some folks may not have seen it yet. Collins: No matter how much a filmmaker may innovate, at the end of the day, a trope is some variation on something we\u2019ve seen before, and as viewing habits change, these clich\u00e9s might result in an eyeroll and subsequent desire to distract yourself with something fresher. Everyone\u2019s appreciation of a particular trope will vary; one might chuckle when they\u2019ve seen their hundredth Survivor Girl try to start the hundredth car that needs three (always three) attempts to start before revving to life, while the person next to them might roll their eyes at how many times it\u2019s been done. And five minutes later, when the killer gets back up after seemingly being dispatched, it might be the other way around. Knowing which clich\u00e9s need to be honored straight up and which need a little twist or subversion is impossible for any filmmaker to know with certainty. The thing that turns someone off from a particular film is undoubtedly going to be the moment that someone else decides it\u2019s their new favorite movie. Serafini: There are subgenres I like more than others. I mean, just hook slashers and gialli into my bloodstream. I know I\u2019m far more forgiving of whatever clich\u00e9s those movies might serve up, but I really don\u2019t mind \u201cthe trope\u201d as a concept across the entire genre and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever disliked a movie because of a filmmaker\u2019s over-reliance on them. And if it works for a younger audience, then who the hell am I to criticize? Reddick: I can\u2019t roll my eyes, because I\u2019ve used some tropes myself, but I do like when a film avoids, or puts a spin on, an old trope. I see tired tropes most often from folks who aren\u2019t diehard horror fans. You know the ones, \u201cLet\u2019s make a horror film because you don\u2019t need stars, or a big budget\u2026and when it\u2019s a success I\u2019ll direct the genre of movies I really want to direct.\u201d Poseurs. But you can\u2019t rag on tropes because they still work. Donato: As someone who\u2019s seeing triple-digits new horror releases a year, my awareness and scare endurance will trump anyone who\u2019s seeing maybe three mainstream horror flicks in theaters during the same timeframe as a comparison. My appreciation of a jolt is always coming down to its execution, never base implementation. Someone who\u2019s witnessing their first \u201cslasher behind the opened fridge door\u201d or \u201ckiller in your car when the overhead light flicks on\u201d is going to emit such a howl when properly punctuated. Everyone has to start somewhere \u2014 Friday the 13th (1980) was not my first \u201cvillain jumps out of the lake when they should be dead\u201d experience, it was Hatchet (2006). Farmer: I appreciate when a filmmaker uses the cliche to fuck with me. When the mirror becomes the focus, when the music builds to draw me in\u2026 then nothing happens. Love that. No scare. No clich\u00e9. I like when the team uses my expectation and conditioning to build my anxiety\u2026 only to make me feel foolish for falling for it. Surprise and shock are a big part of horror, but that surprise and shock doesn\u2019t always have to result in something happening. It can also be the result of expecting something to happen that doesn\u2019t. Rivet: A trope like the roadkill trope always works because the jolt it gives the audience. I don\u2019t so much groan as I marvel at its repeated usage and repeated impact. Especially when huge, distinguished directors keep busting it out again and again. At this point, if someone is driving on a lonely road in a modern horror movie and they look a little distracted, I\u2019m pretty much expecting them to hit some creature in the road, natural or unnatural, and for them to feel really bad about it afterwards. Wolfe: I\u2019m usually pretty amenable to these horror tropes popping up, because I want to see how a filmmaker is interpreting them. I\u2019m of the mind that we\u2019re all basically making the same movies over and over again, but the difference is the filmmaking vision. Gottlieb: I want to see how that filmmaker can play with our expectations and even skewer them without turning into an outright parody of that moment. But I do also believe there is value in younger viewers being introduced to these tropes; avoiding them entirely isn\u2019t just unnecessary but unrealistic. They are part of the cinematic language and it\u2019s up to filmmakers to find interesting and clever ways to use them. Cox: It\u2019s great to see horror tropes subverted, but even when they\u2019re not, I\u2019ll accept it unless it\u2019s half-assed. I won\u2019t roll my eyes if a character running away from a killer trips over a tree root while they\u2019re looking over their shoulder, but I will roll my eyes if that character trips over nothing while looking nowhere. I appreciate that there\u2019s a younger viewer out there \u2014 and I demand only the best for them!",

What should we expect from those upgrades? Our contention would be improved 60fps support along with a more graphics rich 30fps mode, tapping into hardware-accelerated ray tracing.

There's not much to share this week in terms of DF content discussion as we're under embargo on various projects but we look forward to sharing more on some truly special content we have in development, but it's straight on to Supporter Program Q+A and once again, we (obviously) recommend that you become involved! Joining us on the supporter program gives you pristine quality video downloads of our work, access to our awesome Discord (where most of the team regularly contribute) plus early access to DF Direct Weekly - all of our backers now get early access to the Direct every Saturday , which is nice! The show is also available as a podcast, available on a range of providers right here . There are some good questions this week: do movies have frame-pacing issues on TVs (yes - because 24Hz content does not divide equally into a 60Hz refresh) and is there anything users can do about it (yes there is!). We also had an interesting question as to whether DLSS is such a killer feature that it may make Microsoft and Sony jump ship from AMD - perhaps unlikely as the Xbox team is already working on its own ML-based upscaler and because beefed up machine learning features in general will inevitably form a part of future hardware. Do we have 'favourite' temporal anti-aliasing solutions, or which early implementations impressed us most? TAA is effectively a standard in console gaming now, but it's actually been with us a long, long time - and there are some very interesting early examples. And we also tackle a question that comes up quite a lot: why don't we make shorter videos and more of them? That's the show for this week - and I hope you enjoy it.

The restricted cards are getting more efficient by the day at mining Ethereum, the world's second most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and the largest cryptocurrency that is primarily mined using graphics cards (Bitcoin is mostly mined on ASICs, which is a whole other issue).</p><p>A lot of hope has been put on the Ethereum network's switch to a proof-of-stake model rather than a proof-of-work model for its blockchain, which would remove the need for GPU mining at all.

    "full_description": "There are a lot of reasons why the best graphics cards are nearly impossible to find right now . There's the issue of the ongoing chip shortage, a broader supply chain crisis at ports around the world, and even shoppers hunting for Black Friday deals driving up demand for consumer tech putting even more pressure on the availability of semiconductors needed by AMD and Nvidia for their products. But there's also no getting around the fact that cryptomining has been a major driver as well, and a number of recent reports all point to graphics cards remaining scarce through next year at the earliest. To its credit, Nvidia has at least attempted to make their new RTX 3000-series cards less attractive to cryptominers by implementing hash rate limiters , but these have been pretty quickly defeated . The restricted cards are getting more efficient by the day at mining Ethereum, the world's second most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and the largest cryptocurrency that is primarily mined using graphics cards (Bitcoin is mostly mined on ASICs, which is a whole other issue). A lot of hope has been put on the Ethereum network's switch to a proof-of-stake model rather than a proof-of-work model for its blockchain, which would remove the need for GPU mining at all. This would take a lot of the demand off the graphics card market and free up more stock for gamers, creatives, and others who need the cards for purposes other than mining a speculative digital asset. We've been anticipating the Ethereum switchover all year, but now our colleagues over at PC Gamer are reporting that this switchover is now being delayed until at least the middle of next year. In another blow to gamer's hopes at getting a new RTX 3090 any time soon, it looks like Nvidia's highest-end cryptomining processor (CMP), the HX170, is being auctioned off for double what the RTX 3090 is being sold for. With a rather impressive hash rate of 164MH/s, this isn't close to being double the hash rate of the RTX 3090, which is 125MH/s. Given the investment, you're going to turn a profit quicker with an RTX 3090 than you will with the HX170, so Nvidia's solution to huge swaths of graphics card stock being impressed into the cryptomines doesn't look like it will make much of a dent. There was a spot of good news this week in an otherwise bleak outlook for graphics card stock. As of November 1, no General Motors plant will be idled over the lack of computer chips. As one of the strongest indicators that we were in a semiconductor crisis, the fact that GM can start building cars again is great news. That means that more chips are making their way out into the world, something Nvidia and AMD will surely benefit from. Will it be enough though? Honestly, probably not. If Ethereum isn't going to shift from its current proof-of-work model for several more months at the earliest, then that demand isn't going anywhere \u2013 and there's every indication it could simply get worse. The UK-based Standard Chartered bank put out a price prediction for Bitcoin and Ethereum last month that sees as much as a ten-fold increase in the price of Ethereum long-term and it expects Ethereum to eventually surpass Bitcoin in value. Granted, a lot of those gains are expected to come from the network's planned shift to proof-of-stake, but that doesn't remove the incentive to mine as much Ethereum as you can right now so that you can take advantage of that later price increase. In fact, if can mine just one Ethereum, a ten-fold increase in Ethereum's current price will more than cover the cost of an RTX 3090 \u2013 assuming you're patient enough to realize those gains, of course. This means that until the Ethereum network drops the proof-of-work model, graphics card demand is going to remain high and only get higher, possibly matching or surpassing any increase in supply that comes from the increased production of silicon chips. In other words, we're looking at several months of graphics cards possibly becoming more scarce than they already are.",

    "full_description": "EMBL Hamburg's Garc\u00eda Alai Team has released eSPC, a freely available online platform for analyzing molecular biophysics data from a range of experimental techniques. The tool enables scientists around the world to easily analyze their data without the need to travel to the laboratory where the data was generated. All biological processes rely on interactions between molecules, such as proteins. Understanding the biophysical aspects of these interactions \u2014for example, how strong and dynamic they are, and how they change in different conditions\u2014is extremely helpful in many research fields, including structural biology, biomedicine, and biotechnology. Biophysical analyses can, for example, help to identify drug candidates that are most effective in binding their target. Scientists perform biophysical analyses at dedicated facilities, such as the Sample Preparation and Characterisation (SPC) Facility at EMBL Hamburg and the Centre for Structural Systems Biology (CSSB). The SPC Facility offers a pipeline from the lab bench to the synchrotron beamlines, helping users to optimize and prepare their samples for structural studies. As well as accessing advanced equipment and expertise, users can get help from the facility team to analyze data. However, the team frequently faces the problem that the data can only be analyzed using the software connected to the equipment and the facility. \"That means our users would need to be in the facility to analyze their data. This has been a hassle before, but during the 2020 lockdown, it made the work almost impossible,\" said Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda Alai, Team Leader and Head of the SPC Facility. \"Working from home mobilized us to build the eSPC analysis platform, and solve this problem for good. You could see this as a positive aspect of the lockdown.\" The platform enables users to upload and analyze raw data from several experimental techniques: Steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, microscale thermophoresis, and differential scanning fluorimetry experiments. It consists of three modules. FoldAffinity quantifies how an interaction between two molecules can further stabilize them. MoltenProt helps to estimate how durable a protein is in different conditions. ThermoAffinity identifies how strongly two molecules, e.g. a protein and a drug, bind to each other. \"The platform was foreseen as an educational tool ,\" explained Garc\u00eda Alai. \"We have implemented different biophysical theoretical models with tutorials that guide non-experts to assess the quality of their collected data, analyze the results, and produce publication-quality figures. We wanted this tool to be accessible to the whole community to push scientific discoveries forward.\" To ensure the eSPC platform meets the needs of the scientific community, the Garc\u00eda Alai Team collected several rounds of feedback from a group of users. Once the tool was made publicly available, Francesca Short, a researcher at Monash University in Australia, was one of the first users to test FoldAffinity. \"We used FoldAffinity to study how various molecules bind and influence bacterial proteins that contribute to antimicrobial resistance, a critical public health challenge of this century,\" said Short. \"We could only do measurements using methods suitable for small amounts of protein, so it was great for us that FoldAffinity allows us to analyze data generated with these methods. We also liked that the output from eSPC was very comprehensive and easy to understand.\" Looking ahead: The ARISE fellowship to strengthen collaboration Positive feedback from users encouraged the Garc\u00eda Alai Team to look into expanding the platform in the future. To do this, the team recruited Osvaldo Burastero in this year's ARISE program. ARISE is the first fellowship that trains technology developers and engineers to advance technology and method development in life sciences and to learn how to lead service-providing research infrastructures. Burastero will spend part of his fellowship at the Molecular Biophysics facility at the Institute Pasteur. The facility already works with the Garc\u00eda Alai Team within MOSBRI, the pan-European consortium of biophysics facilities. There, he will get hand-on experience in a broad range of new techniques. He will use this knowledge to develop new modules for the platform that cover those techniques. \"For me, it is a great opportunity to work in the Garc\u00eda Alai Team within the ARISE program,\" said Burastero. \"It lets me learn all the aspects of building scientific software, from the theory behind experiments to managing users. I'm excited to contribute to developing a platform that supports scientists around the world, and I look forward to new developments. I hope we can provide a data analysis platform that other research infrastructure for molecular-scale biophysics will recommend to its users.\" Scientific services are at the heart of EMBL's missions, and the SPC Facility's effort to meet the needs of the scientific community is a great example of that. The SPC Facility supports mainly structural biologists, but eSPC can serve as a bridge to interact with and support other scientific fields, fostering interdisciplinary research . Explore further",

    "content": "Frances Haugen, one of (now) multiple Facebook whistleblowers who have come forward in recent years with damning testimony related to product safety, gave testimony in front of the UK parliament today \u2014 where, in one key moment, she was invited to clarify her views on end-to-end encryption following a report in the British newspaper the Telegraph yesterday. The report couched Facebook\u2019s plan to extend its use of e2e encryption as \u201ccontroversial\u201d \u2014 aligning the newspaper\u2019s choice of editorial spin with long-running UK government pressure on tech giants not to expand their use of strong encryption in order that platforms can be ordered to decrypt and hand over message content data on request. In its interview with Haugen, the Telegraph sought to link her very public concerns about Facebook\u2019s overall lack of accountability to this UK government anti-e2ee agenda \u2014 claiming she had suggested Facebook\u2019s use of e2e encryption could disrupt efforts to protect Uighur dissidents from Chinese state efforts to inject their devices with malware. The reported remarks were quickly seized upon by certain corners of the Internet (and at least one other ex-Facebook staffer who actually worked on adding e2e encryption to Messenger and is now self-styling as a \u2018whistleblower\u2019) \u2014 with concerns flying that her comments could be used to undermine e2e encryption generally and, therefore, the safety of scores of Internet users. Sounding unimpressed with the Telegraph\u2019s spin, Haugen told UK lawmakers that her views on e2e encryption had been \u201cmisrepresented\u201d \u2014 saying she fully supports \u201ce2e open source encryption software\u201d; and, indeed, that she uses it herself on a daily basis. What she said she had actually been querying was whether Facebook\u2019s claim to be implementing e2e encryption can be trusted, given the tech giant does not allow for full external inspection of its code as is the case with fully open source e2ee alternatives. This is another reason why public oversight of the tech giant is essential, Haugen told the joint committee of the UK parliament which is scrutinizing (controversial) draft online safety legislation. \u201cI want to be very, very clear. I was mischaracterised in the Telegraph yesterday on my opinions around end-to-end encryption,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a strong supporter of access to open source end to end encryption software. \u201cI support access to end-to-end encryption and I use open source end-to-end encryption every day. My social support network is currently on an open source end-to-end encryption service.\u201d \u201cPart of why I am such an advocate for open source software in this case is that if you\u2019re an activist, if you\u2019re someone who has a sensitive need, a journalist, a whistleblower \u2014 my primary form of social software is an open source, end-to-end encryption chat platform,\u201d she also said, without naming exactly which platform she uses for her own e2ee messaging (Signal seems likely \u2014 a not-for-profit rival to Facebook-owned WhatsApp which has benefited from millions of dollars of investment from WhatsApp founder Brian Action, another former Fb staffer turned critic; so maybe \u2018meta\u2019 would in fact be a perfect new brand name for Facebook). \u201cBut part of why that open source part is so important is you can see the code, anyone can go and look at it \u2014 and for the top open source end-to-end encryption platform those are some of the only ways you\u2019re allowed to do chat in say the defence department in the US. \u201cFacebook\u2019s plan for end-to-end encryption \u2014 I think \u2014 is concerning because we have no idea what they\u2019re doing to do. We don\u2019t know what it means, we don\u2019t if people\u2019s privacy is actually protected. It\u2019s super nuanced and it\u2019s also a different context. On the open source end-to-end encryption product that I like to use there is no directory where you can find 14 year olds, there is no directory where you can go and find the Uighur community in Bangkok. On Facebook it is trivially easy to access vulnerable populations and there are national state actors that are doing this. \u201cSo I want to be clear, I am not against end-to-end encryption in Messenger but I do believe the public has a right to know what does that even mean? Are they really going to produce end-to-end encryption? Because if they say they\u2019re doing end-to-end encryption and they don\u2019t really do that people\u2019s lives are in danger. And I personally don\u2019t trust Facebook currently to tell the truth\u2026 I am concerned about them misconstruing the product that they\u2019ve built \u2014 and they need regulatory oversight for that.\u201d In additional remarks to the committee she further summarized her position by saying: \u201cI am concerned on one side that the constellation of factors related to Facebook makes it even more necessary for public oversight of how they do encryption there \u2014 that\u2019s things like access to the directory, those amplification settings. But the second one is just about security. If people think they\u2019re using an end-to-end encryption product and Facebook\u2019s interpretation of that is different than what, say, an open source product would do \u2014 because an open source product we can all look at it and make sure that what is says on the label is in the can. \u201cBut if Facebook claims they\u2019ve built an end-to-end encryption thing and there\u2019s really vulnerabilities people\u2019s lives are on the line \u2014 and that\u2019s what I\u2019m concerned about. We need public oversight of anything Facebook does around end-to-end encryption because they are making people feel safe when they might be in danger.\u201d Haugen, a former Facebook staffer from the civic integrity team, is the source for a tsunami of recent stories about Facebook\u2019s business after she leaked thousands of pages of internal documents and research reports to the media, initially providing information to the Wall Street Journal, which published a slew of stories last month, including about the toxicity of Instagram for teens (aka the \u2018Facebook Files\u2018), and subsequently releasing the data to a number of media outlets which have followed up with reports today on what they\u2019re calling the Facebook Papers. The tl;dr of all these stories is Facebook prioritizes growth of its business over product safety \u2014 leading to a slew of harms that can affect individuals, other businesses and the public/society more generally whether as a result of inadequate AI systems that cannot properly identify and remove hate speech (leading to situations where its platform can whip up ethnic violence), or which allow engagement based ranking systems to routinely amplify extreme, radicalizing content without proper mind to risks (such as forming conspiracy-theory touting echo chambers forming around vulnerable individuals, isolating them from wider society), or overestimation of its ad reach leading to advertisers being systematically overcharged for its adtech. Internal Facebook documents highlight its moderation and misinformation issues During her testimony today, Haugen suggested Facebook\u2019s AIs were unlikely to even be able to properly distinguish dialectal distinctions and nuances of meaning between UK English and US English \u2014 let alone the scores of languages in countries where it directs far less resource. Parliamentarians probed her on myriad harms during around 2.5 hours of testimony \u2014 and some of her answers repeated earlier testimony she gave to lawmakers in the US. Many of the UK committee\u2019s questions asked for her view on what might be effective regulatory measures to close the accountability gap \u2014 both on Facebook and social media more generally \u2014 as MPs sought to identify profitable avenues for amending draft online safety legislation. \u201cThe danger with Facebook is not individuals saying bad things, it is about the systems of amplification that disproportionately give people saying extreme polarising things the largest megaphone in the room,\u201d argued Haugen. Her list of suggestions for fixing a system of what she couched as broken incentives under Facebook\u2019s current leadership included mandatory risk assessments \u2014 which she warned need to cover both product safety and organisational structure since she said much of the blame for Facebook\u2019s problems lies with its \u201cflat\u201d organizational structure and a leadership team that rewards (and thus incentivizes) growth above all else, leaving no one internally who\u2019s accountable for improving safety metrics. Such risk assessments would need to be carefully overseen by regulators to avoid Facebook using its customary tactic in the face of critical scrutiny of just marking its own homework \u2014 or \u201cdancing with data\u201d as she put it. Risk assessments should also involve the regulator \u201cgathering from the community and saying are there other things that we should be concerned about\u201d, she said, not just letting tech giants like Facebook define blinkered parameters for uselessly partial oversight \u2014 suggesting \u201ca tandem approach like that that requires companies to articulate their solutions\u201d. \u201cI think that\u2019s a flexible approach; I think that might work for quite a long time. But it has to be mandatory and there have to be certain quality bars because if Facebook can phone in it I guarantee you they\u2019ll phone it in,\u201d she also told the committee. Another recommendation Haugen had was for mandatory moderation of Facebook Groups when they exceed a certain number of users. Whereas \u2014 left unmoderated \u2014 she said groups can be easily misappropriated and/or misused (using techniques like \u2018virality-hacking\u2019) to act as an \u201camplification point\u201d for spreading discord or disseminate disinformation, including by foreign information operations. \u201cI strongly recommend that above a certain sized group they should be required to provide their own moderators and moderate every post,\u201d she said. \u201cThis would naturally \u2014 in a content-agnostic way \u2014 regulate the impact of those large groups. Because if that group is actually valuable enough they will have no trouble recruiting volunteers.\u201d Haugen also suggested that Facebook should be forced to make a firehose of information available to external researchers (as Twitter, for example, already does) \u2014 in a privacy-safe way \u2014 which would allow outside academics and experts to drive accountability from the outside by investigating potential issues and identifying concerns freed from Facebook\u2019s internal growth-focused lens. Another of her recommendations was for regulators to demand segmented analysis from Facebook \u2014 so that oversight bodies get full transparency into populations that disproportionately experience harms on its platform. \u201cThe median experience on Facebook is a pretty good experience \u2014 the real danger is that 20% of the population has a horrible experience or an experience that is dangerous,\u201d she suggested. She went on to argue that many of Facebook\u2019s problems result from the sub-set of users who she said get \u201chyper exposed\u201d to toxicity or to abuse \u2014 as a consequence of an engagement-driven design and growth-focused mindset that rejects even small tweaks to inject friction/reduce virality (and which she suggested would only mean Facebook giving up \u201csmall slivers\u201d of growth in the short term and yield a much more pleasant and probably more profitable product over the longer term). \u201cAs we look at the harms of Facebook we need to think about these things as system problems \u2014 like the idea that these systems are designed products, these are intentional choices and that it\u2019s often difficult to see the forest for the trees. That Facebook is a system of incentives, it\u2019s full of good, kind, conscientious people who are working with bad incentives. And that there are lack of incentives inside the company to raise issues about flaws in the system and there\u2019s lots of rewards for amplifying and making things grow more,\u201d she told the committee. \u201cSo I think there is a big challenge of Facebook\u2019s management philosophy is that they can just pick good metrics and then let people run free. And so they have found themselves in a trap where in a world like that how do you propose changing the metric? It\u2019s very very hard because 1,000 people might have directed their labor for six months trying to move that metric and changing the metric will disrupt all of that work. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of it was intentional \u2014 I don\u2019t think they set out to go down this path. And that\u2019s why we need regulation \u2014 mandatory regulation, mandatory actions \u2014 to help pull them away from that spiral that they\u2019re caught in.\u201d Legislation that seeks to rein in online harms by applying regulations to platform giants like Facebook must also not focus only on individual harms \u2014 but needs to respond to societal harms, she also emphasized. \u201cI think it is a grave danger to democracy and societies around the world to omit societal harm. A core part of why I came forward was I looked at the consequences of choices Facebook was making and I looked at things like the global south and I believe situations like Ethiopia are just part of the opening chapters of a novel that\u2019s going to be horrific to read. We have to care about societal harm \u2014 not just for the global south but for our own societies. \u201cWhen an oil spill happens it doesn\u2019t make it harder for us to regulate oil companies. But right now Facebook is closing the door on us being able to act \u2014 we have a slight window of time to regain people-control over AI; we have to take advantage of this moment.\u201d Facebook has been contacted for comment.

Sounding unimpressed with the Telegraph\u2019s spin, Haugen told UK lawmakers that her views on e2e encryption had been \u201cmisrepresented\u201d \u2014 saying she fully supports \u201ce2e open source encryption software\u201d; and, indeed, that she uses it herself on a daily basis. What she said she had actually been querying was whether Facebook\u2019s claim to be implementing e2e encryption can be trusted, given the tech giant does not allow for full external inspection of its code as is the case with fully open source e2ee alternatives. This is another reason why public oversight of the tech giant is essential, Haugen told the joint committee of the UK parliament which is scrutinizing ( controversial ) draft online safety legislation . \u201cI want to be very, very clear. I was mischaracterised in the Telegraph yesterday on my opinions around end-to-end encryption,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a strong supporter of access to open source end to end encryption software. \u201cI support access to end-to-end encryption and I use open source end-to-end encryption every day. My social support network is currently on an open source end-to-end encryption service.\u201d \u201cPart of why I am such an advocate for open source software in this case is that if you\u2019re an activist, if you\u2019re someone who has a sensitive need, a journalist, a whistleblower \u2014 my primary form of social software is an open source, end-to-end encryption chat platform,\u201d she also said, without naming exactly which platform she uses for her own e2ee messaging (Signal seems likely \u2014 a not-for-profit rival to Facebook-owned WhatsApp which has benefited from millions of dollars of investment from WhatsApp founder Brian Action , another former Fb staffer turned critic; so maybe \u2018meta\u2019 would in fact be a perfect new brand name for Facebook ). \u201cBut part of why that open source part is so important is you can see the code, anyone can go and look at it \u2014 and for the top open source end-to-end encryption platform those are some of the only ways you\u2019re allowed to do chat in say the defence department in the US. \u201cFacebook\u2019s plan for end-to-end encryption \u2014 I think \u2014 is concerning because we have no idea what they\u2019re doing to do. We don\u2019t know what it means, we don\u2019t if people\u2019s privacy is actually protected. It\u2019s super nuanced and it\u2019s also a different context. On the open source end-to-end encryption product that I like to use there is no directory where you can find 14 year olds, there is no directory where you can go and find the Uighur community in Bangkok. On Facebook it is trivially easy to access vulnerable populations and there are national state actors that are doing this. \u201cSo I want to be clear, I am not against end-to-end encryption in Messenger but I do believe the public has a right to know what does that even mean? Are they really going to produce end-to-end encryption? Because if they say they\u2019re doing end-to-end encryption and they don\u2019t really do that people\u2019s lives are in danger. And I personally don\u2019t trust Facebook currently to tell the truth\u2026 I am concerned about them misconstruing the product that they\u2019ve built \u2014 and they need regulatory oversight for that.\u201d In additional remarks to the committee she further summarized her position by saying: \u201cI am concerned on one side that the constellation of factors related to Facebook makes it even more necessary for public oversight of how they do encryption there \u2014 that\u2019s things like access to the directory, those amplification settings. But the second one is just about security. If people think they\u2019re using an end-to-end encryption product and Facebook\u2019s interpretation of that is different than what, say, an open source product would do \u2014 because an open source product we can all look at it and make sure that what is says on the label is in the can. \u201cBut if Facebook claims they\u2019ve built an end-to-end encryption thing and there\u2019s really vulnerabilities people\u2019s lives are on the line \u2014 and that\u2019s what I\u2019m concerned about. We need public oversight of anything Facebook does around end-to-end encryption because they are making people feel safe when they might be in danger.\u201d Haugen, a former Facebook staffer from the civic integrity team, is the source for a tsunami of recent stories about Facebook\u2019s business after she leaked thousands of pages of internal documents and research reports to the media, initially providing information to the Wall Street Journal, which published a slew of stories last month, including about the toxicity of Instagram for teens (aka the \u2018 Facebook Files \u2018), and subsequently releasing the data to a number of media outlets which have followed up with reports today on what they\u2019re calling the Facebook Papers . The tl;dr of all these stories is Facebook prioritizes growth of its business over product safety \u2014 leading to a slew of harms that can affect individuals, other businesses and the public/society more generally whether as a result of inadequate AI systems that cannot properly identify and remove hate speech (leading to situations where its platform can whip up ethnic violence), or which allow engagement based ranking systems to routinely amplify extreme, radicalizing content without proper mind to risks (such as forming conspiracy-theory touting echo chambers forming around vulnerable individuals, isolating them from wider society), or overestimation of its ad reach leading to advertisers being systematically overcharged for its adtech. Internal Facebook documents highlight its moderation and misinformation issues During her testimony today, Haugen suggested Facebook\u2019s AIs were unlikely to even be able to properly distinguish dialectal distinctions and nuances of meaning between UK English and US English \u2014 let alone the scores of languages in countries where it directs far less resource. Parliamentarians probed her on myriad harms during around 2.5 hours of testimony \u2014 and some of her answers repeated earlier testimony she gave to lawmakers in the US . Many of the UK committee\u2019s questions asked for her view on what might be effective regulatory measures to close the accountability gap \u2014 both on Facebook and social media more generally \u2014 as MPs sought to identify profitable avenues for amending draft online safety legislation. \u201cThe danger with Facebook is not individuals saying bad things, it is about the systems of amplification that disproportionately give people saying extreme polarising things the largest megaphone in the room,\u201d argued Haugen. Her list of suggestions for fixing a system of what she couched as broken incentives under Facebook\u2019s current leadership included mandatory risk assessments \u2014 which she warned need to cover both product safety and organisational structure since she said much of the blame for Facebook\u2019s problems lies with its \u201cflat\u201d organizational structure and a leadership team that rewards (and thus incentivizes) growth above all else, leaving no one internally who\u2019s accountable for improving safety metrics. Such risk assessments would need to be carefully overseen by regulators to avoid Facebook using its customary tactic in the face of critical scrutiny of just marking its own homework \u2014 or \u201cdancing with data\u201d as she put it. Risk assessments should also involve the regulator \u201cgathering from the community and saying are there other things that we should be concerned about\u201d, she said, not just letting tech giants like Facebook define blinkered parameters for uselessly partial oversight \u2014 suggesting \u201ca tandem approach like that that requires companies to articulate their solutions\u201d. \u201cI think that\u2019s a flexible approach; I think that might work for quite a long time. But it has to be mandatory and there have to be certain quality bars because if Facebook can phone in it I guarantee you they\u2019ll phone it in,\u201d she also told the committee. Another recommendation Haugen had was for mandatory moderation of Facebook Groups when they exceed a certain number of users. Whereas \u2014 left unmoderated \u2014 she said groups can be easily misappropriated and/or misused (using techniques like \u2018virality-hacking\u2019) to act as an \u201camplification point\u201d for spreading discord or disseminate disinformation, including by foreign information operations. \u201cI strongly recommend that above a certain sized group they should be required to provide their own moderators and moderate every post,\u201d she said. \u201cThis would naturally \u2014 in a content-agnostic way \u2014 regulate the impact of those large groups. Because if that group is actually valuable enough they will have no trouble recruiting volunteers.\u201d Haugen also suggested that Facebook should be forced to make a firehose of information available to external researchers (as Twitter, for example, already does) \u2014 in a privacy-safe way \u2014 which would allow outside academics and experts to drive accountability from the outside by investigating potential issues and identifying concerns freed from Facebook\u2019s internal growth-focused lens. Another of her recommendations was for regulators to demand segmented analysis from Facebook \u2014 so that oversight bodies get full transparency into populations that disproportionately experience harms on its platform. \u201cThe median experience on Facebook is a pretty good experience \u2014 the real danger is that 20% of the population has a horrible experience or an experience that is dangerous,\u201d she suggested. She went on to argue that many of Facebook\u2019s problems result from the sub-set of users who she said get \u201chyper exposed\u201d to toxicity or to abuse \u2014 as a consequence of an engagement-driven design and growth-focused mindset that rejects even small tweaks to inject friction/reduce virality (and which she suggested would only mean Facebook giving up \u201csmall slivers\u201d of growth in the short term and yield a much more pleasant and probably more profitable product over the longer term). \u201cAs we look at the harms of Facebook we need to think about these things as system problems \u2014 like the idea that these systems are designed products, these are intentional choices and that it\u2019s often difficult to see the forest for the trees. That Facebook is a system of incentives, it\u2019s full of good, kind, conscientious people who are working with bad incentives. And that there are lack of incentives inside the company to raise issues about flaws in the system and there\u2019s lots of rewards for amplifying and making things grow more,\u201d she told the committee. \u201cSo I think there is a big challenge of Facebook\u2019s management philosophy is that they can just pick good metrics and then let people run free. And so they have found themselves in a trap where in a world like that how do you propose changing the metric? It\u2019s very very hard because 1,000 people might have directed their labor for six months trying to move that metric and changing the metric will disrupt all of that work. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of it was intentional \u2014 I don\u2019t think they set out to go down this path. And that\u2019s why we need regulation \u2014 mandatory regulation, mandatory actions \u2014 to help pull them away from that spiral that they\u2019re caught in.\u201d Legislation that seeks to rein in online harms by applying regulations to platform giants like Facebook must also not focus only on individual harms \u2014 but needs to respond to societal harms, she also emphasized. \u201cI think it is a grave danger to democracy and societies around the world to omit societal harm. A core part of why I came forward was I looked at the consequences of choices Facebook was making and I looked at things like the global south and I believe situations like Ethiopia are just part of the opening chapters of a novel that\u2019s going to be horrific to read. We have to care about societal harm \u2014 not just for the global south but for our own societies. \u201cWhen an oil spill happens it doesn\u2019t make it harder for us to regulate oil companies. But right now Facebook is closing the door on us being able to act \u2014 we have a slight window of time to regain people-control over AI; we have to take advantage of this moment.\u201d Facebook has been contacted for comment.

Typically, loan apps collect borrowers phone data including contacts and demand access to messages to check the history of mobile money transactions \u2013 for credit scoring and as conditions for disbursing loans. Rogue lenders then use some of the contact information collected to recover the loans disbursed in cases where borrowers default. Reports indicate that digital lenders resort to debt shaming tactics, like calling friends and family, to compel their borrowers to repay the loans. The change adds to a raft of measures taken by Kenyan lawmakers to protect citizens from rogue digital lenders who offer high-priced collateral-free loans. It grants the regulator, Central Bank of Kenya, power to oversee the operations of standalone digital lenders (not affiliated with banks) after a period of self-regulation. Digital lenders, will going forward, be required to obtain licenses to operate in Kenya unlike previously where they just had to register \u2013 which led to the proliferation of rogue apps. The Central Bank of Kenya amendment 2021 bill also gives the regulator the power to cap interest rates and to suspend or revoke the licenses of digital lenders that breach \u201cthe conditions of the Data Protection Act or the Consumer Protection Act.\u201d Kenya\u2019s Data Protection Act requires firms to disclose to customers the reasons for collecting their data. It also ensures that borrowers\u2019 confidential information is safe from infringement by unauthorized parties. This comes as consumer lobbies accuse loan apps of sharing customer information with data and marketing companies. The digital lenders will also be required to reveal all the information concerning their products, and this includes details on pricing, penalties for defaulters and means of debt recovery. This is in line with the country\u2019s Consumer Protection Act which requires sellers to disclose to consumers all the terms and conditions pertaining to the purchase of goods or services. Almost all lending apps were found to use debt shaming tactics to recover debt in Kenya. Kenya is home to about 100 mobile lending apps including Okash and Opesa both owned by the Chinese-owned browsing giant Opera, and which have faced claims of using predatory lending tactics in Kenya. Okash and Opesa are some of tens other loan apps that were found to charge exorbitant interest rates and to have exploitative terms \u2013 like issuing 30-day loans instead of the 60 days stipulated by Google Play Store policies. The interest rates of the two Chinese loan apps were exorbitant reaching up to 876% annualized rates yet banks yearly rates rarely exceed 20%. Other apps including the San-Francisco based Branch International Ltd., and Paypal backed Tala, were found to charge extortionist rates, with annualized interest rates of 156-348% and 84-152.4%, respectively. The lenders\u2019 lobby, which represents 25 digital lenders disbursing about $40 million a month, told TechCrunch that members expressed their concern over capping of the interest rate but said they were happy with the new law especially because their feedback was taken. The association lobbied for the removal of minimum capital requirements, deposit rations and for the regulator to cede control of innovation or new products. \u201cWe are happy that the space is regulated now and that we are able to access the Central Bank (regulator) and mechanisms for dispute regulations have also been put in place. But price control is what concerns us and we are not happy with that \u2013 the moment you put an interest rate cap then there won\u2019t be any lending. We are nervous about that but it is fair,\u201d said the Digital Lenders Association of Kenya chairman, Kevin Mutiso. But having regulations in place, Mutiso said, is going to help grow the lending space in the country as the lenders collaborate with partners including the regulator to make it more robust. \u201cLack of regulation was making the market unpredictable, now we know what we can do and not do. And also, we are going to have better debt collection practices,\u201d said Mutiso. \u201cThe law, we believe, is going to make Kenya to be the number one fintech market in the world because everything is clear now \u2013 from what is expected from the lenders and the borrowers. We are also going to see better products efor our customers especially the MSMEs (micro and small medium enterprises),\u201d he said. The apps offer collateral-free loans making them attractive to borrowers looking for quick cash, and who are often locked out by banks due to prerequisites such as account history. While digital credit is easily accessible, its short tenure makes it expensive, while ease of access has led to borrowing from multiple apps resulting in debt distress and the reduction of credit scores \u2013 affecting the borrowers\u2019 ability to obtain credit from banks in future. A study by the Kenya Bankers Association shows that convenience and ease of access are the predominant reasons that customers take into account when making decisions on the platforms to access credit from. It found that self-employed people prefer digital to conventional credit attributable to liquidity changes that they encounter while in their line of business, pointing to how loan apps are preferred during emergencies too. The new law gives the regulator powers to determine the pricing parameters that will be followed by the digital lenders when setting the cost of credit. Exorbitant interest rates are not unique to Kenya, in India, loan apps were found to charge interest rates as high as 60% per week. There were reports of people committing suicide after harassment by loan-recovery agents in the south Asian country. West African countries have also witnessed the proliferation of loan apps, with Nigeria among the largest markets in the region. A report by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), a research and advocacy organization, also found digital loan default rates and delinquency high among 20 million borrowers in Tanzania. It reported that most borrowers used the loans for daily needs instead of emergencies or for investments. \u201cOne of the most important things regulators can do to reduce these numbers is to improve transparency on loan terms and conditions, making it easier for customers to make informed decisions,\u201d said CGAP. The organization recommended more stringent rules to govern loan apps and called for transparency on loan terms among lenders.",

This is the TRD model, and that stands for \u201cToyota Racing Development\u201d; it\u2019s a badge that\u2019s supposed to stand for tough, off-road-ready capabilities. In this case, it seems to be working, as I\u2019m able to easily keep up to a pack of actual rally cars ahead. Article content Admittedly, one of those cars is a Saab Sonnett with less than 60 horsepower. Perhaps we\u2019re setting the bar a little low. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team . Why more and more automakers are catering to the outdoorsy crowd Back to video But welcome to the latest trend in selling cars. At time of writing, the RAV4 is the best-selling passenger vehicle in Canada \u2014 assuming you leave full-size pickup truck sales off the list. Where once ordinary families got around in four-cylinder, four-door sedans, we now apparently must have the go-anywhere, do-anything capability of a crossover. In this specific case, the trendy RAV4 TRD made for a great chase photography vehicle for covering one of Classic Car Adventure\u2019s more-adventurous rallies . Back when everyone was buying sedans, car companies looked to increase sales by bringing out sport versions. They still do so, but to a lesser extent in the mid-size sedan market. For a time, however, you could spec your Honda Accord with a spoiler, and your Nissan Altima with aggressive wheels and uprated V6 power. Actually, come to think of it, the Altima SE-R was a genuinely cool machine. Article content But did consumers actually need all this performance for the average school run? Probably not. Overall, the sport package or appearance package remains just an attempt to entice buyers into showrooms and get them all riled up about buying something that is basically a dishwasher on four wheels. More On This Topic First Drive: 2022 Subaru Outback Wilderness Honda refreshes 2022 Passport, including new TrailSport trim Now that tastes have changed for appliances that are large, somewhat blobby, tall hatchbacks, manufacturers are looking for new ways to differentiate their models . Selling the look of performance is still part of the strategy, but a growing number of automakers are now baiting their hooks with the fat, juicy worm of off-road capability. Article content Subaru owes basically its entire brand identity to the idea that families can purchase an ordinary car that\u2019s capable of doing roughly 80 per cent of what a Jeep Wranger or Toyota Tacoma is capable of doing. But even it is doubling down with its new Wilderness edition of the Outback , and an extra-off-roady treatment is coming for the Forester as well . Classic rally cars on a Classic Car Adventures rally in B.C. Photo by via Classic Car Adventures To be fair to Subaru, this move is both marketing savvy as well as responding to actual market demands. There\u2019s a late-model Outback down the street from me with a lift kit and Primitive Racing heavy-duty skidplates armouring its underbelly. It\u2019s perpetually muddy and has a light coating of B.C. bush pinstriping (that is to say, scratches from the small trees that encroach on narrow trails). Article content This is to say nothing of the hordes of chunky-tired Crosstreks roaming the corridor between North Vancouver and Whistler. Subaru owners like to modify their vehicles to be (or at least look) more off-road-capable. 2022 Honda Passport TrailSport Photo by Honda Do Honda owners? Well, that\u2019s what that company is betting on with its upcoming TrailSport lineup . According to the official press release, \u201cThe first models to incorporate the TrailSport treatment will feature rugged front and rear styling, durable cladding, and exclusive interior touches, including high-contrast orange stitching and available signature all-weather mats that are easier to clean.\u201d Honda\u2019s release goes on to say that later models will get increased ground clearance, a full-size spare, and other useful off-road equipment. However, first prepare for a Ridgeline that looks tougher than the regular-strength version, but actually isn\u2019t. Article content A growing number of automakers are now baiting their hooks with the fat, juicy worm of off-road capability Over the next few years, buyers will have to be extra-informed about what the capabilities of their off-road-look crossover actually are; our testing team will keep you alerted to any soft-roaders pretending to be outdoor heroes. Singling out the TrailSport line is not meant to throw Honda under the bus, as the all-terrain tires and softer suspension on the aforementioned RAV4 TRD make for worse fuel economy and less cornering grip, respectively. Honda is perhaps serving its customers better by offering an appearance upgrade that won\u2019t come with a penalty at the pump. Actual technical off-road driving requires both a skilled driver and a proper 4\u00d74 vehicle. The local Toyota 4\u00d74 club in B.C. is happy to help new owners learn the ropes, but if you talk to experienced owners, even they will mention that a factory-spec Tacoma has its limitations when the going gets really rough. On trails where a Tacoma or Jeep Wrangler is going to struggle, your shiny new extra-lifted Subaru is probably not going to make it. Article content 2022 Subaru Forester Wilderness Photo by Subaru Having said that, it should be pointed out that the local Subaru owners club also hosts off-road excursions for Foresters and Crosstreks and the like. Getting out and exploring the outdoors with your friends is great fun. I will also admit that there is something incredibly satisfying about dropping off the kids at school in a mud-spattered Subaru and parking next to a never-seen-a-mud-puddle Mercedes-Benz G-Class . Consider carefully, however, whether all this off-road capability is something you either want or actually need. Off-road-capable tires look cool, but they\u2019re task-specific. You\u2019ll get worse fuel economy, and have less grip on tarmac. If your kids are prone to motion sickness, I have bad news about what a lifted suspension can do to queasy rear-seat passengers in a series of corners. Article content A classic rally car on a Classic Car Adventures rally in B.C. Photo by via Classic Car Adventures The other part of the equation you probably already know, and that\u2019s the fact that most gravel roads aren\u2019t really all that challenging. A non-TrailSport Honda CR-V is perfectly capable of getting to most of the trailheads that an Outback Wilderness can get to, and almost all of the same camping sites. Heck, you could probably get the same places in a Honda Civic. If you\u2019ve done a bit of off-roading, or at least exploring along gravel roads, then you know that it\u2019s common to run into all sorts of ordinary cars out in the woods, from low-powered Westfalias to battered Toyota Priuses. Or that Saab Sonnet mentioned earlier. It\u2019s the same game it\u2019s always been, whether it\u2019s spoilers on sedans, or plastic body-cladding on crossovers. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to go ask Subaru if it\u2019s going to make a Wilderness edition of the Subaru WRX. Obviously, nobody needs such a ridiculous thing. But wouldn\u2019t it be fun?",

    "full_description": "After speeding up during 2020, Earth's rotation has settled down. But timekeepers say we still may need a \"negative leap second\" in the next decade. On average, each Earth day contains 86,400 seconds. But Earth's rotation isn't perfect; it varies slightly all the time depending on the movement of the core, oceans and atmosphere. Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the official international timekeeping method, is based on the atomic clock, which measures time by the movement of electrons in atoms that have been cooled to absolute zero. Atomic clocks are precise and invariable. So when Earth's rotation and the atomic clocks don't quite sync up, something has to give. When astronomical time, based on Earth's rotation, deviates from UTC by more than 0.4 seconds, UTC gets an adjustment in the form of a \"leap second.\" Sometimes leap seconds are added, as last happened on New Year's Eve 2016, when a second was added at 23 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds of Dec. 31. Scientists have added a leap second about every 18 months on average since 1972, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Related: Climate change is making Earth dimmer When seconds are subtracted, it's known as a negative leap second. There has never been a negative leap second in international timekeeping, but 2020 raised the possibility that one might be needed. That year, Earth's rotation sped up, breaking the previous record for shortest day, set in 2005, 28 times. The shortest day in 2020 occurred on July 19, when the planet completed its rotation 1.4602 milliseconds faster than the average of 86,400 seconds. \u2014 How does time work? \u2014 Way to be weird, Earth: 10 strange findings about our planet \u2014 5 of the most precise clocks ever made Now, according to Time and Date , Earth's spin has simmered down. The first half of 2021 was still speedy, with the average length of a day clocking in at 0.39 milliseconds less than in 2020. But from July 1 to Sept. 30, the days lengthened to 0.05 milliseconds more, on average, than in 2020. What that means, according to Time and Date, is that Earth is no longer accelerating its rotation. But it is still spinning at a quicker rate than average. Based on the current rate of rotation, a negative leap second might be required in about 10 years. The ultimate decision belongs to the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) in Paris. Of course, the planet may have other ideas. It's entirely possible that Earth's spin will slow again, perhaps necessitating the addition of a second in the coming years instead of the subtraction. There's no predicting it: Scientists aren't sure what drives the long-term changes in Earth's rotation. \"We've tried internally modeling things for the next two or more years,\" Nick Stamatakos, one of the U.S. Naval Observatory representatives to the IERS Directing Board, told Time and Date. \"But we run into trouble predicting more than six months or one year ahead.\" Originally published on Live Science .",

A livestream for the launch will begin at 9:45 p.m. EDT (0145 GMT or 10:45 a.m. local time Tuesday, Oct. 26). You can watch it live in the window above, courtesy of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which builds and operates H-2A rockets the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). You can also watch it directly via the company's YouTube . Launch is scheduled to take place at the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. EDT Monday (0200-0300 GMT; or 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. local time Tuesday). The satellite, QZS-1R, will be a replacement for the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System 1 satellite system first launched in 2010. The official QZSS website lists four satellites in the constellation : QZS-1, QZS-2, QZS-3 and QZS-4. Related: How GPS systems help people navigate The QZSS constellation will eventually consist of a total of seven satellites that fly in an orbit passing through a near-zenith (or directly overhead) above Japan, and it is meant to share nearly the same transmission signals as recent GPS satellites, according to JAXA . It is specially optimized for mountainous and urban regions in Japan, JAXA said. Mitsubishi Industries will be launching the satellite on an H-2A 202 rocket. The launch system has been operational since 2003 and has sent satellites to locations such as Venus (Akatsuki) and Mars (Emirates Mars Mission.) This will be the first launch of the HII-A since Nov. 29, 2020, when Japan launched an advanced relay satellite with laser communications tech into orbit.

VSe 2 can undergo a phase transition where it changes from an ordinary metal into a state where its electrons behave like a quantum fluid. To be able to observe and study the wave that these electrons then form, the so-called charge density wave, the researchers used a technique known as optical spectroscopy, which allows them to study the \"sloshing\" motion of the density wave as it responds to the electric field of light. This motion is usually difficult to measure, because the wave motion is disrupted by small defects and impurities in the crystal. Recent advances in crystal growth minimize the number of defects in VSe 2 and make it possible to see signatures of the hard-to-observe charged density wave. Explore further",

    "description": "\u201cThe new KINGS on the block,\u201d wrote Didier Drogba on Twitter in response to a picture of him with Liverpool\u2019s Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. Less than 24 hours after Salah\u2019s scintillating hat-trick at Old Trafford propelled him past Drogba to become the highest-scoring African player in the Premier League, his former Chelsea teammate also retweeted a cartoon in which he places a crown on the Egypt forward\u2019s head. With Liverpool leading 2-0 against a ragged Manchester United on Sunday and Salah tied with Drogba on 104 goals, there was a sense of inevitability that the big moment would arrive for the player from the small town of Nagrig in the Nile Delta. It was fitting that the assist for the record-breaking goal in the 38th minute came from Guinea\u2019s Naby Keita, with Salah making it 106 seven minutes later before rounding off the rout by becoming the first visiting player to score a hat-trick at Old Trafford since Real Madrid\u2019s Ronaldo in 2003 and the first in the Premier League. A simple comparison with the African players he has surpassed puts into context what Salah has achieved. Whereas the appearance against United was his 167th in the league, Drogba\u2019s tally for Chelsea came in 254 games across two spells that also saw him win the Golden Boot twice. Mane, who moved to Anfield a year before Salah in 2016 and reached the 100-goal milestone against Watford last week, is next on the list having played 237 games, with Emmanuel Adebayor and Yakubu making up the top five with similar ratios. \u201cHe has been so consistent every season,\u201d says the Egyptian journalist Fady Ashraf from the Filgoal website. \u201cThe Premier League is the most difficult in the world, but no one else has managed to score as many goals since he came to England.\u201d Development One key to that consistency has been the ruthlessness that has put Salah up with the very best marksmen in Premier League history. Once the fifth-choice left-back for Al Mokawloon\u2019s youth team before being switched to the wing, his rapid development after two years in Switzerland with Basel led Chelsea to gazump Liverpool by signing him for \u00a311 million in 2013. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho afforded Salah only 13 league appearances, and although Salah got off the mark in English football in the 6-0 thrashing of Arsenal at Stamford Bridge, he was allowed to leave for Italy after 18 months. It was at Fiorentina then Roma, whom he joined on a permanent deal in 2016, that Salah found his clinical touch. For two years he worked with Jaime Pabon, a former striker from Colombia, spending hours honing his finishing technique on a pitch in the back garden of the coach\u2019s house in Rome after returning from training. \u201cI recommended to look at the ball, to make good choices, with angles that were more difficult for the goalkeepers,\u201d said Pabon. \u201cWe did a lot of repetitions, employing that advice.\u201d The hard work had clearly paid dividends by the time Salah joined Liverpool in 2017, with 44 goals in all competitions during his debut season, including 31 in the league, securing his first Golden Boot. A second \u2013 shared with Mane and Gabon\u2019s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang \u2013 as Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side won the Champions League in 2019 underlined his qualities as he came fifth, one place behind Mane, in the Ballon d\u2019Or standings. Liverpool\u2019s court Salah even scored 22 league goals last season when Liverpool\u2019s form evaporated midway through the campaign, surpassing his 19 as they ended their 30-year wait for the title. Although his future has yet to be resolved as he closes in on the last 18 months of his contract, Salah has insisted he would like to stay and that the ball is in Liverpool\u2019s court. With Egypt not having played a tournament during 2021 his hopes of becoming the first African to win the Ballon d\u2019Or since George Weah in 1995 may have to wait until next year. Should he replicate his performances for Liverpool with the Pharaohs as they attempt to win the Africa Cup of Nations for a record eighth time in January, it would be hard to ignore his case. \u201cIt\u2019s the missing piece - like [Cristiano] Ronaldo when he won the Euros in 2016 with Portugal,\u201d says Ashraf on the Made in Africa podcast. \u201cMo doesn\u2019t have a big achievement with the national team.\u201d Given Salah\u2019s growing achievements, it is surely a matter of time until he puts that right. \u2013 Guardian",

The documents were disclosed to US regulators and provided to Congress in redacted form by Frances Haugen\u2019s legal counsel.

Earlier this month, Haugen testified in Congress that the social media company does not do enough to ensure the safety of its 2.9 billion users, plays down the harm it can cause to society and has repeatedly misled investors and the public. The Wall Street Journal also ran a series of articles called the Facebook Files. Here are four surprising revelations the documents contain: Facebook has a huge language problem Facebook is often accused of failing to moderate hate-speech on its English-language sites but the problem is much worse in countries that speak other languages, even after it promised to invest more after being blamed for its role in facilitating genocide in Myanmar in 2017. One 2021 document warned on its very low number of content moderators in Arabic dialects spoken in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Libya. Another study of Afghanistan, where Facebook has 5 million users, found even the pages that explained how to report hate speech were incorrectly translated. Advertisement Enlarge / Facebook allocated only 13 percent of its budget for developing misinformation detection algorithms to the world outside the US Washington Post | Getty Images The failings occurred even though Facebook\u2019s own research marked some of the countries as \u201chigh risk\u201d because of their fragile political landscape and frequency of hate speech. According to one document, the company allocated 87 percent of its budget for developing its misinformation detection algorithms to the US in 2020, versus 13 percent to the rest of the world. Haugen said Facebook should be transparent on the resources it has by country and language. Facebook often does not understand how its algorithms work Several documents show Facebook stumped by its own algorithms. One September 2019 memo found that men were being served up 64 percent more political posts than women in \u201cnearly every country,\u201d with the issue being particularly large in African and Asian countries. While men were more likely to follow accounts producing political content, the memo said Facebook\u2019s feed ranking algorithms had also played a significant role.

With macOS Monterey release , Darkroom is ready to support Shortcuts on the Mac. In the update\u2019s release notes, the team behind Darkroom says: We\u2019re excited to roll out full support for Shortcuts on macOS. This is particularly exciting for us because of all the ways that shortcuts are integrated into Monterey. You can now edit your photos right from Finder, from the menu bar, or from context menus. The full power of Darkroom\u2019s editing engine is exposed, including cropping, filters, frames, and more. This works for photos anywhere on your file system, not only those in iCloud Photo Library! Alongside the Shortcuts feature on the Mac, Darkroom is also adding RAW Smart Album on Monterey and iOS 15. With that, the library sidebar and album selector now lists a RAW Smart Album that collects all of users RAW and RAW+JPEG photos in one place. Another feature that was exclusive to the iPhone and iPad \u201cdue to technical constraints\u201d is finally available with macOS Monterey: Clarity. In a blog post in May, the Darkroom developers explained how this feature works: Clarity adjusts the contrast within the details of your image, without affecting the overall tone of the image. As you adjust Clarity, the details are either clarified or smoothened, but the whites and blacks remain unaffected, and sharp edges remain sharp. Apart from these features, there\u2019s also deeper keyboard shortcuts integration, zoom improvement, bug fixes, and overall improvements within the app. Darkroom is available on the App Store for iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

The metaverse, which could spring up again when Facebook releases earnings Monday, is the latest buzzword to capture the tech industry's imagination. It could be the future, or it could be the latest grandiose vision by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that doesn't turn out as expected or isn't widely adopted for years \u2014 if at all. Plus, many have concerns about a new online world tied to a social media giant that could get access to even more personal data and is accused of failing to stop harmful content. Here's what this online world is all about: WHAT IS METAVERSE? Think of it as the internet brought to life, or at least rendered in 3D. Zuckerberg has described it as a \u201cvirtual environment\u201d you can go inside of \u2014 instead of just looking at on a screen. Essentially, it's a world of endless, interconnected virtual communities where people can meet, work and play, using virtual reality headsets, augmented reality glasses, smartphone apps or other devices. It also will incorporate other aspects of online life such as shopping and social media, according to Victoria Petrock, an analyst who follows emerging technologies. \u201cIt\u2019s the next evolution of connectivity where all of those things start to come together in a seamless, doppelganger universe, so you\u2019re living your virtual life the same way you\u2019re living your physical life,\u201d she said. But keep in mind that \u201cit\u2019s hard to define a label to something that hasn\u2019t been created,\" said Tuong Nguyen, an analyst who tracks immersive technologies for research firm Gartner. Facebook warned it would take 10 to 15 years to develop responsible products for the metaverse, a term coined by writer Neal Stephenson for his 1992 science fiction novel \u201cSnow Crash.\u201d WHAT WILL I BE ABLE TO DO IN THE METAVERSE? Things like go to a virtual concert, take a trip online, and buy and try on digital clothing. The metaverse also could be a game-changer for the work-from-home shift amid the coronavirus pandemic. Instead of seeing co-workers on a video call grid, employees could see them virtually. Facebook has launched meeting software for companies, called Horizon Workrooms, to use with its Oculus VR headsets, though early reviews have not been great. The headsets cost $300 or more, putting the metaverse's most cutting-edge experiences out of reach for many. For those who can afford it, users would be able, through their avatars, to flit between virtual worlds created by different companies. \u201cA lot of the metaverse experience is going to be around being able to teleport from one experience to another,\u201d Zuckerberg says. Tech companies still have to figure out how to connect their online platforms to each other. Making it work will require competing technology platforms to agree on a set of standards, so there aren't \u201cpeople in the Facebook metaverse and other people in the Microsoft metaverse,\u201d Petrock said. IS FACEBOOK GOING ALL IN ON THE METAVERSE? Indeed, Zuckerberg is going big on what he sees as the next generation of the internet because he thinks it's going to be a big part of the digital economy. He expects people to start seeing Facebook as a metaverse company in coming years rather than a social media company. A report by tech news site The Verge said Zuckerberg is looking at using Facebook\u2019s annual virtual reality conference this coming week to announce a corporate name change, putting legacy apps like Facebook and Instagram under a metaverse-focused parent company. Facebook hasn\u2019t commented on the report. Critics wonder if the potential pivot could be an effort to distract from the company's crises, including antitrust crackdowns, testimony by whistleblowing former employees and concerns about its handling of misinformation. Former employee Frances Haugen, who accused Facebook's platforms of harming children and inciting political violence, plans to testify Monday before a United Kingdom parliamentary committee looking to pass online safety legislation. IS THE METAVERSE JUST A FACEBOOK PROJECT? No. Zuckerberg has acknowledged that \u201cno one company\u201d will build the metaverse by itself. Just because Facebook is making a big deal about the metaverse doesn\u2019t mean that it or another tech giant will dominate the space, Nguyen said. \u201cThere are also a lot of startups that could be potential competitors,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are new technologies and trends and applications that we\u2019ve yet to discover.\u201d Video game companies also are taking a leading role. Epic Games, the company behind the popular Fortnite video game, has raised $1 billion from investors to help with its long-term plans for building the metaverse. Game platform Roblox is another big player, outlining its vision of the metaverse as a place where \u201cpeople can come together within millions of 3D experiences to learn, work, play, create and socialize.\u201d Consumer brands are getting in on it, too. Italian fashion house Gucci collaborated in June with Roblox to sell a collection of digital-only accessories. Coca-Cola and Clinique have sold digital tokens pitched as a stepping stone to the metaverse. Zuckerberg\u2019s embrace of the metaverse in some ways contradicts a central tenet of its biggest enthusiasts. They envision the metaverse as online culture's liberation from tech platforms like Facebook that assumed ownership of people's accounts, photos, posts and playlists and traded off what they gleaned from that data. \u201cWe want to be able to move around the internet with ease, but we also want to be able to move around the internet in a way we\u2019re not tracked and monitored,\u201d said venture capitalist Steve Jang, a managing partner at Kindred Ventures who focuses on cryptocurrency technology. WILL THIS BE ANOTHER WAY TO GET MORE OF MY DATA? It seems clear that Facebook wants to carry its business model, which is based on using personal data to sell targeted advertising, into the metaverse. \u201cAds are going to continue being an important part of the strategy across the social media parts of what we do, and it will probably be a meaningful part of the metaverse, too,\" Zuckerberg said in the company's most recent earnings call. That raises fresh privacy concerns, Nguyen said, involving \u201call the issues that we have today, and then some we\u2019ve yet to discover because we\u2019re still figuring out what the metaverse will do.\u201d Petrock she said she\u2019s concerned about Facebook trying to lead the way into a virtual world that could require even more personal data and offer greater potential for abuse and misinformation when it hasn\u2019t fixed those problems in its current platforms. \u201cI don\u2019t think they fully thought through all the pitfalls,\u201d she said. \u201cI worry they\u2019re not necessarily thinking through all the privacy implications of the metaverse.\u201d",

    "full_description": "The sharpest images ever of living bacteria have been recorded by UCL researchers, revealing the complex architecture of the protective layer that surrounds many bacteria and makes them harder to be killed by antibiotics. The study, published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and done in collaboration with scientists at National Physical Laboratory, King's College London, University of Oxford and Princeton University, reveals that bacteria with protective outer layers\u2014called Gram-negative bacteria\u2014may have stronger and weaker spots on their surface. The team found that the protective outer membrane of the bacteria contains dense networks of protein building blocks alternated by patches that do not appear to contain proteins. Instead, these patches are enriched in molecules with sugary chains (glycolipids) that keep the outer membrane tight. This is an important finding because the tough outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria prevents certain drugs and antibiotics from penetrating the cell: this outer membrane is part of the reason why antimicrobial resistance of such bacteria (including A. baumannii , P. \ufeff aeruginosa , and enterobacteriaceae such as Salmonella and E. coli ) is now considered a greater threat than that of Gram-positive bacteria such as resistant S. aureus (well known as MRSA). \"The outer membrane is a formidable barrier against antibiotics and is an important factor in making infectious bacteria resistant to medical treatment. However, it remains relatively unclear how this barrier is put together, which is why we chose to study it in such detail,\" explained corresponding author Professor Bart Hoogenboom (London Centre for Nanotechnology at UCL and UCL Physics & Astronomy). \"By studying live bacteria from the molecular to cellular scale, we can see how membrane proteins form a network that spans the entire surface of the bacteria, leaving small gaps for patches that contain no protein. This suggests that the barrier may not be equally hard to breach or stretch all over the bacterium, but may have stronger and weaker spots that can also be targeted by antibiotics.\" To better understand this architecture, the scientists ran a tiny needle over living Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) bacteria, thus \"feeling\" their overall shape. Since the tip of the needle is only a few nanometres wide, this made it possible to visualize molecular structures at the bacterial surface. The resulting images show that the whole outer membrane of the bacteria is crammed with microscopic holes formed by proteins that allow the entry of nutrients while preventing the entry of toxins. Although the outer membrane was known to contain many proteins, this crowded and immobile nature had been unexpected. Surprisingly, the images also revealed many patches that did not appear to contain proteins. These patches contain a glycolipid normally found on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, a different type of pimple-like patch formed when parts of the membrane were flipped inside out due to mutations. In this case, the appearance of these defects correlated with enhanced sensitivity to bacitracin, an antibiotic usually only effective against Gram-positive, but not against Gram-negative bacteria. As explained by Georgina Benn, who did the microscopy on the bacteria in Professor Hoogenboom's lab at UCL: \"The textbook picture of the bacterial outer membrane shows proteins distributed over the membrane in a disordered manner, well-mixed with other building blocks of the membrane. Our images demonstrate that that is not the case, but that lipid patches are segregated from protein-rich networks just like oil separating from water, in some cases forming chinks in the armor of the bacteria. This new way of looking at the outer membrane means that we can now start exploring if and how such order matters for membrane function, integrity and resistance to antibiotics.\" The team also speculate that the findings may help explain ways by which bacteria can maintain a tightly packed, protective barrier while still allowing rapid growth: the common bacterium E. coli doubles in size and then divides in 20 minutes under favorable conditions. They suggest that the glycolipid patches may allow for more stretch of the membrane than the protein networks, making it easier for the membrane to adapt to the growing size of the bacterium.

    "full_description": "Climate 'tipping points' can be better understood and predicted using climate change data taken from the ancient past, new research shows. Current understanding of tipping points, in which the climate system exceeds a threshold beyond which large and often irreversible changes occur, is limited. This is because such an event has not occurred in recent times and certainly not since scientists started to record climate data. Earth System models, routinely used to predict climate, are taken from our understanding of the physical, chemical and biological processes that work together to shape our planet's environment. Scientists know that these models do not provide a complete picture, however, because they fail to simulate known climate events from the past. In a new study published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers at the University of Birmingham and the University of Bristol demonstrate how knowledge of climate reconstructions from thousands of years ago can be used to fine-tune Earth System models to provide a more accurate understanding of climate system thresholds. Senior author, Dr. Peter Hopcroft, of the University of Birmingham's School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, said: \"Climate modelling is the only way we have to predict future climate change, but when models are developed they are only evaluated with weather observations from the past 150 years or so. This means we have no way to verify their predictions of potential abrupt change\u2014the risks of which are only likely to increase as the planet warms. Palaeoclimate records of abrupt climate changes from the deeper past allow us overcome this problem.\" In their study the team focused on one key example, the 'greening' and subsequent rapid desertification of the Sahara, which took place in the mid-Holocene period, around 6,000 years ago. By feeding data from fossil pollen and sedimentary records into a typical climate model , they were able to show how the model could then predict the Sahara's transformation into a savannah, which was marked by increased plant coverage, expansion of lakes and most importantly increased rainfall. The results were then independently compared with studies of marine sediment records from the region, showing how the model accurately captured a very rapid return to the desert conditions over the Sahara. \"We now need to apply these methods to other models to test how universal the results might be,\" added Dr. Hopcroft. \"But by demonstrating how paleoclimate information can be used to improve the way models can simulate past abrupt climate change, we hope that we can begin to increase our confidence in future projections of abrupt events.\" Explore further",

    "full_description": "An urgent increase in policy support and investment would be needed for carbon capture and storage (CCS) to achieve the scale needed to meet global decarbonisation goals, according to University of Queensland and Princeton University researchers. The study's lead author, Dr. Joe Lane, said CCS was regarded as a key technology for reducing energy and industrial sector emissions and for achieving negative emissions when coupled with bioenergy or direct air capture of carbon dioxide . \"Most scenarios for deep decarbonization of the global economy rely on massive scale CCS to be compliant with the Paris Agreement\u2014which means between three and 20 gigatons of CO 2 per year being captured and stored, worldwide by 2050,\" Dr. Lane said. \"Even the lower targets imply an extremely challenging pace and scale of CCS deployment across all major economies.\" UQ Centre for Natural Gas Director Professor Andrew Garnett said more information is needed globally to support such high expectations. \"Those scenarios typically assume that there is more than enough storage volume available in porous geological reservoirs around the world,\" Professor Garnett said \"But the essence of our abatement challenge is not the volume of storage available, it's the rate at which CO 2 can be safely injected and permanently contained that counts. \"We have a poor understanding of injection rates that can be sustained in key regions and in aggregate\u2014there is simply not enough key data available.\" Princeton University Senior Research Scientist from the Andlinger Center for Energy and Environment, Dr. Chris Greig, said the storage uncertainty created a \"chicken and egg\" problem for CCS ambitions. \"The characterization work required to build confidence in our storage capacity relies on mobilizing tens of billions of dollars in risk capital over the next decade,\" Dr. Greig said. \"Currently, these capabilities are in the oil and gas sector. \"For the necessary investment to happen, storage developers need to be confident that the capture projects will actually be built before they enter into long term storage contracts. \"At the same time, investors will remain cautious until there's a high level of confidence that cost-effective storage capacity will be available.\" Dr. Lane said strategic planning is needed now if carbon dioxide storage is to play a major role for decarbonising crucial industries and the developing world.

    "full_description": "What a mighty, drenching cyclone. An unusually strong mid-latitude cyclone \u2014 a sprawling, comma-shaped storm occurring in the middle latitudes \u2014 deluged much of the parched West Coast with extreme rains over the weekend. Some rainfall, like in Sacramento, broke records . These cyclones are comprised of air and clouds rotating around an area of low atmospheric pressure, and a prodigious amount of moisture (water vapor) wrapped around this late October storm. This potent band of moisture, a part of the storm aptly dubbed an \" atmospheric river ,\" dumped immense rains. Water poured through the drought-stricken Sierra Nevada , triggered major landslides , and also dropped some much-needed snow . The satellite images below, taken by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellites, show vivid images of the potent, counter-clockwise spinning cyclone, which traveled farther inland on Monday . Atmospheric rivers are crucial weather events in California. They deliver about half the Golden State's water supply , but their occurrences fluctuate significantly from year to year, resulting in periods of intense drought or immensely wet seasons. Yet in an incessantly warming world , extremes are becoming more extreme. Droughts are becoming hotter and drier , and powerful storms are dumping more intense, destructive rains . A warmer atmosphere holds more water (for every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit of warming, or one degree Celsius, the air holds about seven percent more water vapor ), which boosts the odds of strong storms dumping significantly more precipitation. \"You're raising the ceiling on precipitation potential,\" Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research , told Mashable in 2019 . \"Atmospheric rivers will be more intense, delivering more water.\" Atmospheric scientists expect California's water cycle to grow increasingly extreme and volatile as the planet warms. The latest storm, occurring amid a historic drought, is a vivid example. \"It is worth noting that this exact situation \u2014 an extremely strong atmospheric river bringing [a] brief period of record rainfall in midst of [a] severe and temperature-amplified drought \u2014 is what we expect to see in California with #ClimateChange,\" Swain tweeted on Sunday .",

    "full_description": "T-Mobile has begrudgingly given its CDMA network, which it planned to shut down by the end of 2021, a stay of execution. The company inherited this outdated network when it finalized its merger with Sprint in April 2020. Sprint embraced CDMA in its network in 1996, which means it's currently 25 years old, and has seen numerous wireless generations come and go. It was last used by Verizon, US Wireless, and Sprint in their 3G networks. So it's no wonder T-Mobile wants to stop supporting the moribund technology so it can focus on rolling out 5G connectivity to more coverage areas throughout the US. \"This is why we have aggressively executed on plans to take care of transitioning our impacted Sprint CDMA customers by the end of this year and provided our partners plenty of time and resources to take care of their customers as well,\" T-Mobile says . \"Recently it\u2019s become increasingly clear that some of those partners haven\u2019t followed through on their responsibility to help their customers through this shift. So, we\u2019re stepping up on their behalf. We have made the decision to extend our deadline for the CDMA sunset by three months to March 31, 2022.\" The company says this delay \"has no material financial impact to our business\" and that \"the rapid pace of our 5G buildout will continue.\" T-Mobile also touts the success of its 5G rollout: 308 million people have access to its Extended Range 5G, it says, of whom 186 million are covered by Ultra Capacity 5G. The goal is to expand the availability of that mid-band 5G network (which offers a better-than-4G experience but not peak 5G performance) to 200 million people by the end of 2021. \"Our reason for extending is simple: we want to give those partners who haven\u2019t done the right thing for their customers every opportunity to step up now and do so,\" T-Mobile says. \"There should be no more room for excuses. We have provided even more time and those partners can follow suit with the effort that is needed to ensure no one is left on the wrong side of the digital divide.\"",

Teaming with Sierra Space and backed by various companies and organizations, including Boeing, Redwire Space, Genesis Engineering Solutions, and Arizona State University, Orbital Reef is described as a \u201c\u2018mixed use business park\u2019 in space,\u201d according to Blue Origin\u2019s announcement today. Essentially, it seems like Blue Origin and Sierra Space envision Orbital Reef as a place for private businesses and universities to conduct research and develop technologies in microgravity environments. \u201cAs the premier commercial destination in low Earth orbit, Orbital Reef will provide the essential infrastructure needed to scale economic activity and open new markets in space,\u201d today\u2019s announcement reads. The Orbital Reef will employ reusable space transportation to shuttle resources and people back and forth between the station and the Earth, while the station itself will use \u201cadvanced automation and logistics\u201d to \u201cminimize cost and complexity\u201d for clients. It seems that Blue Origin even sees a future where Orbital Reef can be used by nations lacking a space program for low Earth orbit research. \u201cSeasoned space agencies, high-tech consortia, sovereign nations without space programs, media and travel companies, funded entrepreneurs and sponsored inventors, and future-minded investors all have a place on Orbital Reef,\u201d Blue Origin said in today\u2019s announcement. Blue Origin will be providing things like the utility systems, the large core models for the station, and the New Glenn launch system. On the other hand, Sierra Space will be providing the Large Integrated Flexible Environment module, node modules, and the Dream Chaser spaceplane, which can shuttle crew and cargo to Orbital Reef and land on runways around the world. Other companies will also provide components, with Boeing offering up science modules and the Starliner crew spacecraft. Arizona State University has a unique job in helping get Orbital Reef off the ground, as it will lead \u201ca global consortium of universities providing research advisory services and public outreach.\u201d While all of this certainly sounds interesting, it will be quite some time before we see Orbital Reef ready for clients. Blue Origin announced today that the space station should begin operating in the second half of this decade, but that\u2019s a very big window of time. Still, by the time 2030 rolls around, we could have a private space station acting as a research hub for private businesses, and that could be a game-changer.",

    "full_description": "ShadowProtect SPX Desktop is a backup app for Windows and Linux that creates and restores only one kind of backup\u2014the kind that creates an image of a complete disk partition, not individual files. Other backup apps can create both image backups and file backups, and some online backup services create file backups in the cloud or on your disk. ShadowProtect SPX Desktop may only perform one kind of backup, but it does that job so reliably it\u2019s our Editors' Choice winner for backup software. Other products and services are very good for file backup, but ShadowProtect SPX Desktop is the app to rely on to restore a complete system after a hardware failure or a malware attack. If you value your data, it should be your first line of defense. I\u2019ve been using different versions of ShadowProtect for more than 15 years without a single serious hiccup. That\u2019s something I can\u2019t say about any of its rivals. It\u2019s rescued me from dozens of software and hardware mishaps. When you test software as often as I do, you inevitably come across apps that damage your files or your system. I've long since learned ShadowProtect\u2019s app can undo the damage quickly, reliably, and easily. Additionally, if you ever have the bad luck of getting zapped by ransomware, ShadowProtect SPX Desktop is the best way to recover your system without paying anything to the bad guys. ShadowProtect SPX Desktop works so reliably partly because it\u2019s the consumer- and SOHO-level version of an extensive set of backup solutions designed for corporate and enterprise use. The same rock-solid technology that powers StorageCraft\u2019s high-end backup systems also powers the lower-priced consumer version\u2014reviewed here. ShadowProtect\u2019s major rival is Acronis Cyber Protect , formerly called Acronis TrueImage. ShadowProtect offers only image-based backups. Acronis, in contrast, offers image-based, file-based, and cloud-based backup on Acronis\u2019s servers. You can buy ShadowProtect SPX as a one-time purchase for $99. Subscription plans are available for Windows Server and other advanced versions. Acronis stopped offering one-time purchases earlier this year and now only offers subscription services starting at $44.99 per year for current students, with other options starting at $59.99 per year. As an image-based backup app, ShadowProtect backs up an entire system, or one or more disks in a system, instead of backing up individual files. If you really care about your data, you\u2019ll use both an image-based backup and a file-based backup method. The reason? Sometimes having a file-based backup system makes it easier to recover an earlier version of a document, or to recover a file you wish you hadn\u2019t deleted. I use and recommend both iDrive , an Editors' Choice-winning service, and Dropbox for different kinds of file-based backup and syncing, and I use ShadowProtect SPX for recovering individual files from its backup images. But ShadowProtect SPX is the only app I trust for restoring an entire system or an entire disk when something goes wrong. Its VirtualBoot feature lets me boot a backed-up image in a window on my desktop. This means if my hardware fails, I can launch my backed-up system on another machine and get my work done, even without restoring it. (See The Beginner's Guide to PC Backup for how to get started.) ShadowProtect runs only on Windows and Linux. Acronis Cyber Protect Home is available for more platforms, including macOS, iOS, and Android. Acronis\u2019s backup software offers dozens of features ShadowProtect doesn\u2019t even try to match. Over the years, however, I\u2019ve had bad experiences with Acronis\u2019 products, including backups that didn\u2019t restore and, once, a system that wouldn\u2019t boot after I uninstalled an Acronis app. A backup app needs to work all the time, with no ifs, ands, or buts. ShadowProtect SPX does exactly that. One minor warning: If you\u2019re seriously tech-challenged, and you don\u2019t have enough confidence to click on a few menus to find the item you need, get someone\u2019s help when you first install ShadowProtect SPX. This is a long-established app designed for both corporate and individual use. It uses a wizard interface for all operations, but you\u2019ll need at least the minimal skills required to navigate to the drives or network shares you want to back up to and restore from. In the rest of this review, I\u2019ll assume you have those minimal skills. It takes around two minutes to set up a backup plan with ShadowProtect SPX, and then you don\u2019t have to think about it again until you need to restore a system, disk, or file. The app\u2019s three-pane interface is highly informative to experienced users, but beginners will be glad to have the overlay image that appears when you first run the app to explain the essential features. The first thing you\u2019ll need to do is create one or more Destinations for your backups, meaning local and USB-connected disks or network shares where you want to store your backups. Then you create backup plans for each destination, selecting the disk partitions you want to back up, the level of encryption you want for protecting your backup images, and a scheduling plan that lets you create or update your backups at intervals ranging from every 15 minutes to once a month, with options to back up only on certain days of the week. You can also create one-time backups you run only when you choose. You can create full backups, which create an image of an entire disk partition, or full backups followed by incremental backups, which back up only files changed since the last full backup. With the second option, when you need to restore from a backup, you can zero in on the date and time of the incremental backup you want to use. Other options let you fine-tune the backup strategy so that the app deletes older generations of backups before creating new ones, so that you don\u2019t run out of disk space when saving to a local or USB drive. Also, I recommend selecting the option that sends you an email notification when a backup operation encounters problems. The only time you need the SPX app\u2019s interface is when creating a backup plan or to look at a timeline showing the history of your backups. You can also use the interface to restore a drive from a backup or to perform a Virtual Boot that launches your backup as a complete system inside a window. You don\u2019t need the interface to perform these functions, however; you can also right-click on a ShadowProtect image file to open or boot it. ShadowProtect offers three ways to recover data from a backup image. First, you can mount a backup image so it appears as a drive letter on your Windows system, and you then simply drag files or folders from the mounted image to any folder in your system. One useful option lets you mount the backup image as a writeable image, which lets you drag files into the image for use in the future. The actual image file isn\u2019t changed, but the app creates a supplementary file that contains the files that will be added to the image the next time you mount it. Second, you can use the app\u2019s interface to restore any partition on your system other than the current boot partition. You won\u2019t need to restart your machine before or after the restore. This method is useful for restoring non-booting drives you use for storing data, or, if you have a multi-boot system, you can use this method to restore one of your boot drives after you\u2019ve booted into the other boot drive. Third, you can boot from a USB drive or DVD-R disk that contains the ShadowProtect Recovery Environment. This is a bootable system you create from a download on StorageCraft\u2019s web site. It\u2019s what you use when you need to restore your Windows system drive and other drives because your original machine won\u2019t boot, or when you want to transfer your system to a new machine. If you\u2019re restoring to a different machine, you\u2019ll probably need to choose the option to perform a hardware-independent restore. This means the app will remove any hardware-specific drivers from the backup image when restoring it to a new machine, so that when the restored system starts up, Windows will load the drivers needed by your new hardware. ShadowProtect\u2019s VirtualBoot feature\u2014the feature that lets you boot up a backed-up system drive in a virtual machine\u2014is a triumph of power and convenience. Before you use it, you must install one of the following: 1) the freeware VirtualBox , 2) Windows\u2019 built-in but optional Hyper-V feature, or 3) VMware\u2019s Vsphere hypervisor, typically used only in corporate settings. If you want to use Windows\u2019 Hyper-V , you must also download and install ShadowProtect\u2019s Hyper-V plug-in. If you try to use VirtualBoot with Hyper-V and haven\u2019t installed the ShadowProtect plug-in, you get an obscure message about an \u201cunknown error,\u201d so don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. I was able to use Hyper-V to boot up a backed-up image of my system disk in less than a minute. To protect yourself from ransomware and other malware , you need to get into the habit of making backups on removable drives and detaching those drives from your system after a backup is complete. Doing so prevents ransomware from reaching out and encrypting them. If you\u2019ve been smart enough to take these precautions, then you have a good chance of recovering from even the worst ransomware attack. Here\u2019s how to do it through ShadowProtect\u2019s VirtualBoot feature. If your system has been disabled by ransomware, the malware was probably lurking in your system before it fired up and encrypted your data. You don\u2019t want to restore your system from a backup that has the ransomware lurking inside it waiting to pounce again. So, to prevent this, find a clean system, run ShadowProtect SPX, and use the VirtualBoot feature to boot up a backed-up image. Inside that image, run a malware-detection program to see if the ransomware payload is present. If the payload isn\u2019t present in the backup, then you can safely restore your system from that image. If the payload is present, you can try to remove it from the virtual-booted system, then make a backup image of the cleaned system, and restore your actual hardware from that image. If you can\u2019t remove the payload, boot older backup images until you find one that\u2019s clean, and restore your system from that. Again, you need to keep some drives available with backup images on them, but if you value your data, you\u2019re already doing exactly that with whatever backup software you use now. On paper, Acronis Cyber Protect may look like the better backup choice, because it's more flexible. Indeed, it is an Editors' Choice-winning app. But what matters most in a backup app is reliability. I\u2019ve never had a single problem with ShadowProtect. With Acronis, that's simply not the case. That said, Acronis performs many different tasks and it usually does them all extremely well. If you need it for a task ShadowProtect doesn't perform, it's an excellent choice. ShadowProtect SPX Desktop does just one job\u2014image backups\u2014and does it perfectly. It\u2019s our top-scoring Editors' Choice winner for backup apps.",

Called Crew-3 , SpaceX's next astronaut mission for NASA will launch three American astronauts and one European Space Agency astronaut to the International Space Station on a six-month mission. Liftoff is set for Oct. 31 (Halloween) at 2:21 a.m. EDT (0621 GMT). The crew includes mission commander Raja Chari and mission specialists Tom Marshburn and Kayla Barron, all from NASA, and European astronaut Matthias Maurer. SpaceX and NASA will hold a media teleconference tonight to discuss today's Flight Readiness Review meeting and you'll be able to listen in live. That briefing will begin no earlier than 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT) tonight . It will be posted above at the top of this page at start time. The joint crews of SpaceX's Crew-2 mission and the International Space Station have joined up to form one big group of 11 people in orbit . \"We're so excited to be here, we're ready to get to work,\" Crew-2 pilot Megan McArthur told acting NASA astronaut Steve Jurczyk after entering the station. There won't be 11 people together on the space station for long. The four astronauts of SpaceX's Crew-1 mission, which launched in November 2020, will return to Earth on April 28, leaving seven crewmembers behind. You'll be able to find that mission coverage here with live landing updates and coverage. The Crew-2 astronauts, meanwhile, will stay onboard for the next six months. That will wrap up our live coverage for Crew-2's launch and docking. Thanks for joining us. The hatches are officially open between SpaceX's Crew-2 Dragon capsule and the International Space Station. Crew-2 astronauts opened the final hatch between their two spacecraft at 7:05 a.m. EDT (1105 GMT) as the two vehicles sailed 267 miles over the South Pacific Ocean. The Crew Dragon crew will install some ducts for air circulation before entering the station. Inside the station, the station's Expedition 64 crew is eagerly awaiting their new crewmates. SpaceX's Crew-2 Dragon spacecraft successfully docked itself at the International Space Station Saturday (April 24), making history as the first used SpaceX capsule to ferry astronauts to the orbiting lab. The Crew Dragon Endeavour docked at the space station at 5:08 a.m. EDT (0908 GMT) to deliver NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Akihiko Hoshide of Japan and Thomas Pesquet of France to their new home for the next six months. After a series of leak checks, the hatches between Endeavour and the space station will be opened at 7:15 a.m. EDT (1115 GMT). A welcome ceremony with all 11 of the astronauts on the station is expected at 7:45 a.m. EDT. The four Crew-2 astronauts have awakened in orbit aboard the Crew Dragon Endeavour for what will be their docking day at the International Space Station. Astronauts Shane Kimbrough, Megan McArthur (both of NASA), Akihiko Hoshide of Japan and Thomas Pesquet of France awoke at just after 10 p.m. EDT (0200 GMT) to start their Flight Day 2. Endeavour is scheduled to dock itself at the space station on Saturday, April 24, at 5:10 a.m. EDT (0910 GMT) after a series of orbital maneuvers, a flyaround of the station and closing burns to dock at the forward port of the station's U.S.-built Harmony module. Speaking during a news conference held shortly after launch, SpaceX founder Elon Musk talked about how important it was for the company to be flying crew. \"I'm just really proud of the SpaceX team and honored to be partnered with NASA and helping with JAXA and ESA as well,\" he said.

NASA and SpaceX are expected to hold a press conference at around 7:30 a.m. EDT (1130 GMT) to discuss today's successful launch to the International Space Station. You can follow that press conference in the livestream above or by visiting here . SpaceX's Crew Dragon Endeavour is chasing the International Space Station in what will be a 23-hour flight to the orbiting laboratory. Endeavour has performed a \"phasing burn\" one of several maneuvers to keep the spacecraft on track to arrive at the International Space Station on Saturday, April 24. Docking is set for 5:10 a.m. EDT (0910 GMT). The four Crew-2 astronauts will soon take off their sleek SpaceX-issue spacesuits and don more comfortable clothes for trip to the space station. Following a spectacular early morning launch of the Falcon 9 rocket from Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, Crew Dragon and its crew of four astronauts are safely in orbit. Crew Dragon has separated from the Falcon\u2019s second stage, nosecone deploy is coming up as the spacecraft is beginning its approach to the International Space Station. The first stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket for today's Crew-2 launch has successfully landed on the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You in the Atlantic Ocean following today's astronaut launch for NASA. This marks the second landing for this Falcon 9 rocket and the second crewed flight. It launched NASA's Crew-1 astronaut mission to the International Space Station in November 2020. The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with the Crew Dragon spacecraft has lifted off from Kennedy Space Center\u2019s Launch Complex 39A. NASA Crew-2 commander Shane Kimbrough and pilot Megan McArthur are reporting that the launch vehicle and spacecraft are performing nominally as they commence the 12-minute climb to orbit. The Crew Dragon spacecraft has transitioned to internal power for this morning's launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at 5:49 AM EDT (0949 GMT) from Launch Complex 39A at Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center. The Falcon 9 propellant tanks have been topped off with liquid oxygen (LOX) and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1). As the countdown nears T-0, flight computers will assess the Falcon 9 engine steering system and the vehicle\u2019s propellant tanks will be pressurized to flight pressure.

The four astronauts are strapped into their seats, running through pre-launch checklists and are closely monitoring spacecraft systems in preparation for their ascent to orbit. No technical or vehicle issues are being worked at this time, with very little chatter on the internal communication loops. Weather conditions and the Eastern Range are \u2018Green\u2019 for launch. Falcon 9 has been cleared to commence propellant loading. The SpaceX launch director has just given the OK to start fueling the first stage of the 215 foot-tall (65 meter) two-stage Falcon 9 launch vehicle, which is powered by liquid oxygen (LOX) and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1). The crew access arm is being retracted and Crew Dragon\u2019s emergency launch escape system will be armed, preparing the spacecraft to separate from the launch vehicle in the unlikely event of anomaly on the pad or during ascent. Once the system is armed, propellant loading will soon follow. Crew Dragon features an advanced abort system with eight SuperDraco engines and a series of parachutes that can be activated instantaneously from the moment they are armed on the launch pad all the way through orbital insertion. The four astronauts have just closed and locked their visors in preparation for launch. The SpaceX launch team is not working any technical issues at this time with Falcon 9 or Crew Dragon. Weather is currently \u2018Green\u2019 for launch. Launch is scheduled for 5:49 AM EDT (0949 GMT). Rock, paper, scissors!The crew is going through their steps ahead of schedule and are passing the extra time aboard the Crew Dragon spacecraft with a couple of rounds of the game. pic.twitter.com/1MUSHQUnyi April 23, 2021 SpaceX's closeout crew has departed Launch Pad 39A ahead of today's Crew-2 astronaut launch on a Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon Endeavour. Today's countdown has proceeded smoothly, with no weather or vehicle concerns. NASA has captured some video of the Crew-2 astronauts playing Rock, Paper, Scissors inside Endeavour after hatch closure. Check it out above. Update: That hand signal game by the Crew-2 astronauts was not, in fact, Rock Paper Scissors, but a game astronaut Thomas Pesquet played as a kid growing up in France, per NASA. The countdown is proceeding smoothly for this morning\u2019s launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with the Crew Dragon spacecraft. Liftoff is scheduled for 5:49 AM EDT (0949 GMT). Communication checks between the launch team, flight controllers and the spacecraft have been completed. The launch team is carefully reviewing vehicle data to decide if fueling operations can commence; shortly, the SpaceX launch director is expected to give the OK to start loading propellants into the 215 foot-tall (65 meter) two-stage Falcon 9 launch vehicle. Falcon 9 is powered by liquid oxygen (LOX) and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1). The launch team is not working any technical issues at this time. Crew Dragon's Endeavour hatch has been closed and latched for flight, the four astronauts are strapped into their seats and preparations are progressing smoothly for this morning\u2019s Falcon 9 launch attempt from Launch Complex 39A at Florida's Kennedy Space Center - the second operational mission to the International Space Station in the Commercial Crew Program. SpaceX's black-clad close-out crew are about 16 minutes ahead of schedule for their launch prep work. Crew-2 mission commander Shane Kimbrough and pilot Megan McArthur have completed air-to-ground communications checks to ensure that the four astronauts can talk to flight controllers and each other during the spacecraft's ascent to orbit. Suit leak checks have also been completed. Launch is scheduled for 5:49 AM EDT (0949 GMT). The launch team is not tracking any technical issues; launch weather forecast remains favorable, with a 90 percent probability of acceptable conditions at launch time. All four Crew-2 astronauts have boarded their SpaceX Crew Dragon Endeavour for today's predawn launch to the International Space Station. You can see them in the NASA TV image above. From left, they are: ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet, NASA astronauts Megan McArthur and Shane Kimbrough, JAXA astronaut Akihiko Hoshide. The astronauts have closed their SpaceX spacesuit helmets for leak checks and swiveled their seats upward into launch position for today's launch at 5:49 a.m. EDT (0949 GMT). NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Meghan McArthur are now inside the Crew Dragon. ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet and JAXA astronaut Akihiko Hoshide will board next. The four Crew-2 astronauts have arrived at Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where they will lift off less than three hours from now. In about 15 minutes the astronauts will begin to board the Crew Dragon Endeavour. NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide and European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet are just about finished getting into their SpaceX spacesuits ahead of their flight. The crew is scheduled to leave the Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building at 2:29 a.m. EDT (0629 GMT) and board their Tesla Model X vehicles, in which they will be driven to Launch Complex 39A. They are scheduled to arrive at the launch site at 2:54 a.m. EDT (0654 GMT). NASA's live broadcast of the SpaceX Crew-2 launch to the International Space Station has begun! We are just over four hours away from liftoff, which is scheduled for 5:49 a.m. EDT (0949 GMT). You can watch the launch live here and find more information about NASA's Crew-2 webcasts here . SpaceX's Crew-2 astronaut launch will liftoff from Florida's Space Coast before sunrise on Friday, April 23, and there's a chance for observers along the U.S. East Coast to see the rocket's ascent into orbit. According to Space.com columnist Joe Rao, skywatchers with clear skies have a chance to see the second stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket as it streaks toward space. Exactly when the Falcon 9 will be visible, and for how long, depends on your location along the East Coast. You can see tips on when and how to see the SpaceX launch in our full story here . SpaceX is less than a day away from launching the Crew-2 astronauts to the International Space Station. As with every SpaceX launch for NASA, you'll be able to watch the mission live online. NASA's webcast will begin at 1:30 a.m. EDT (0630 GMT) and then run continuously through docking at the space station on Saturday. Here's our full preview for Friday's launch from contributor Amy Thompson in Cape Canaveral, Florida. NASA and SpaceX have delayed the launch of the Crew-2 astronaut mission to the International Space Station to no earlier than Friday, April 23 due to bad weather downrange. Liftoff is now set for 5:49 a.m. EDT (0949 GMT) . \"Although conditions around the launch site were expected to be favorable for liftoff, mission teams also must consider conditions along the flight path and recovery area in the unlikely event of a launch escape,\" NASA officials said in a statement today . You can read our full story on the launch delay here . The four astronauts of NASA's Crew-2 mission to the International Space Station have arrived at their Kennedy Space Center launch site for an April 22 launch on SpaceX's Crew Dragon Endeavour and Falcon 9 rocket. The crew, NASA astronauts Shanek Kimbrough, Megan McArthur, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Akihiko Hoshide and European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet, arrived at KSC's Launch and Landing Facility (a former Shuttle Landing Facility). They are scheduled to launch on April 22 at 6:11 a.m. EDT (1011 GMT). Today (April 17) , the Crew-2 astronauts will hold a virtual press conference at 9:45 a.m. EDT (1345 GMT) . You can watch it live on this page and here on Space.com , courtesy of NASA TV. SpaceX is one week away from launching four astronauts into space for NASA to begin a months-long trek to the International Space Station. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will launch the astronauts on the Crew-2 mission for NASA on Thursday, April 22. Liftoff is set for 6:11 a.m. EDT (1011 GMT). The space agency will hold a Flight Readiness Review briefing today, April 15, at 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT) to discuss the mission. You can watch that live here and follow along at the top of this page.

    "content": "Simon Wu Contributor Share on Twitter Simon is an investment director with Cathay Innovation, a global venture capital firm investing across North America, Europe, Asia and Africa. He focuses on software, fintech, digital health and consumer investments. More posts by this contributor From startups to Starbucks: The embedded API opportunity How retailers can survive the Amazon era The quest to provide more affordable and accessible healthcare, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic, has spurred an explosion of innovation, which in turn has attracted massive amounts of capital. To put this into perspective, consider this: In 2019, digital health saw $7.7 billion in VC investment, and that number rose to $14.6 billion in 2020. However, the first half of 2021 alone saw $14.7 billion in VC investment. Its marriage with fintech is the catalyst for the transformation of the healthcare industry. Similar to the unbundling of financial services and how fintech is scaling vertical SaaS, the pandemic-fueled disaggregation of healthcare has created new players that are taking a page out of the fintech revolution book \u2014 all starting with payments. A growing number of startups are now leveraging the fintech playbook to solve a key part of the healthcare problem \u2014 the shifting dynamics between patients, payers and providers, and how payments and related electronic health records (EHRs) flow between them. Not only is the onus of payments and data flow moving from payers to patients, but providers are now facing a monumental shift to new billing and engagement models, requiring new technologies and platforms to help with the change. Through the lens of fintech, here are three key areas to watch in healthcare. Gamifying consumer wellness to stave off chronic illnesses One of the largest trends impacting the population today is the steady rise of chronic illnesses. It is estimated that nearly half the U.S. population will have a chronic illness by 2025. People are getting sicker for longer periods of time, which leads to a constant spending streak. Patients not adhering to medical guidance is a major factor and is responsible for $100 billion of healthcare spending and over 100,000 deaths annually. With around a fifth of patients never filling their prescriptions, it has become a priority to educate and incentivize patients to complete care and avoid readmissions or ER visits. The convergence of health and fintech will be an important catalyst to address some of the most pressing issues facing healthcare today. To curb the rise of chronic illnesses and the associated recurring costs, many startups are using behavioral economics and gamification to incentivize patients and build healthy habits. For example, companies like Paceline in the U.S., Sweatcoin in Europe and Betterfly in Latin America gamify wellness by combining fitness and financial rewards. On the other hand, startups like Sempre Health and Wellth are tackling medical non-adherence with behavioral economics. For example, Wellth financially rewards actions like on-time prescription intake or regular A1c tests for diabetic patients. Fintech for affordability and reducing friction Looking at payers, there\u2019s a major shift stemming from the rise of high-deductible healthcare plans (HDHP) \u2014 enrollment has risen 43% in the last five years \u2014 emphasizing an increase in premiums and patient financial responsibility. Out-of-pocket expenses threaten the financial stability for many, with 40% of Americans unable to pay an unexpected bill of $400.",

    "content": "YouTube says it will soon begin to demonetize some of the channels on its platform that market themselves as \u201cmade for kids\u201d if the content they produce is low-quality, encourages negative behavior or attitudes, or is heavily commercial. The company had previously warned this sort of content would no longer be eligible for inclusion in its dedicated YouTube Kids app, but starting next month YouTube will also begin to enforce new monetization policies as well, which may impact the creators\u2019 eligibility for or possible removal from the YouTube Partner Program. YouTube first announced its plans to increase its protections for minors in August, saying that some of the updates would directly address upcoming regulations, while others were going beyond what would be required by law. At the time, YouTube said it would shift the default settings on videos for users ages 13 to 17 to private, would enable \u201ctake a break\u201d and bedtime reminders for minors, would stop leveraging \u201cinterests\u201d data for targeting teens and kids with ads, and more. Among the changes was a warning to those creators specifically making content aimed at kids, noting the company planned to remove \u201coverly commercial content\u201d from its standalone YouTube Kids app aimed at younger children. Ahead of this move, a number of consumer advocacy groups had been pressuring YouTube and regulators alike to put an end to these types of videos, saying they blurred the lines between content and advertising. Plus, they argued, some creators weren\u2019t disclosing that they had brand relationships behind the scenes that were fueling this sort of content production. But without enforcement and guidelines around what\u2019s appropriate for kids, some of YouTube\u2019s largest creators were channels like multimillionaire Ryan Kaji of Ryan ToysReview (now Ryan\u2019s World), which focused heavily on consumerism and toy unboxings. YouTube in August said that it would remove content from YouTube Kids that incited viewers to buy a product and \u201ccontent focused on the excessive accumulation or consumption of products.\u201d Now, YouTube is warning that any channel targeting younger audiences or those that are classified as \u201cmade for kids\u201d could be at risk of demonization if they put out other sorts of low-quality content. This includes content that encourages negative behavior and attitudes (like bullying, dishonestly, disrespect to others, dangerous pranks, unhealthy eating habits, and more); content that\u2019s deceptively educational; content that hinders comprehension; content that\u2019s sensational or misleading; and content that includes strange use of children\u2019s characters. (The latter had been a particular problem in recent years as videos featuring characters like Peppa Pig in situations that were not kid-friendly). Image Credits: YouTube Starting in November, YouTube says it will begin to enforce additional monetization policies with these quality principles in mind for channels designated \u201cmade for kids\u201d or that frequently create content that\u2019s made for kids. If the creators are making low-quality content, according to these principles, they may be removed or blocked from joining the YouTube Partner Program. Other videos that fall under the low-quality principles may receive limited or no advertising. Initially, YouTube says it will start with videos that encourage negative behavior. Others that have a strong focus on low-quality \u201cmade for kids\u201d content will also go under review, the company added. These negative principles were already factors that determined if the content is appropriate for YouTube Kids and informed the larger YouTube algorithm. But monetization changes are a much more powerful tool to shape what sort of content creators actually produce. YouTube says creators whose channels could be impacted by the monetization changes will receive an email before the changes go into effect. In addition, even those channels that aren\u2019t immediately impacted but produce low-quality kids\u2019 content may receive a yellow icon in a warning to advertisers. The company didn\u2019t say how many channels may be impacted as a result of its new policy. On the flip side, content that adheres to high-quality principles will be recommended more by the YouTube algorithm going forward, in addition to being included in the YouTube Kids app. The high-quality principles include things like content that encourages kids to be a good person; content that encourages learning and curiosity; content focused on creativity, play and a sense of imagination; content that focuses on interaction with real-world issues; and content that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion. The announcement arrives on the heels of an increased examination of the role tech companies are playing when it comes to the well-being of minors using their services. Already, Google and YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok have announced updates that place more emphasis on the safety and privacy of their younger users. YouTube also launched new parental controls. This week, Snap and TikTok will have to face their first Congressional hearing, too. YouTube says it will continue to reevaluate and update its principles going forward.",

Article content According to a report in U.K.\u2019s Autocar , Hiroshima\u2019s commitment to gasoline-powered engines will continue \u2014 at least through to development of the next variant of its popular MX-5 sports car. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team . Next-gen Mazda MX-5 rumoured to retain gasoline engine Back to video While such a machine is more than a few years away from any sort of public introduction, those in the know are alleging it will not include a plug-in hybrid or battery-electric powertrain. This could definitely be construed as good news. After all, while such types of motivation have long since shed their appliance/commuter car roots, the fact remains that batteries tend to be extremely heavy. One of the MX-5\u2019s headline features is its light weight; in fact, the current model (ND) doesn\u2019t weigh appreciably more than the original car (NA) despite needing to incorporate kit like modern safety equipment and typical passenger comforts. Article content More On This Topic Generation Gap: Ranking each and every Mazda MX-5 Miata Convertible Review: 2021 Mazda MX-5 RF GT Mazda has begun dipping a tentative toe in the EV waters, of course, producing the curious MX-30 , which features clamshell doors and less than 200 kilometres of driving range. Speculation is rampant that the company is using this rig as something a test-bed for future product, rather than jumping headfirst into a segment in which it has limited experience. Even on the gasoline-powered side of Mazda\u2019s ledger, a range of extremely efficient engines do their part in keeping a lid on its average fuel economy or CO2 emissions, depending on the market in which it is playing. And since the MX-5 sells in relatively small numbers compared to its crossover and SUV lineup, eschewing electrification on that model probably won\u2019t make that much difference to overall fleet numbers.",

This is the first Apple TV+ series filmed completely in Korean, and its release coincides with the official launch of the streaming service in South Korea. Written and directed by Kim Jee-woon (A Tale of Two Sisters, I Saw the Devil), the new six-episode live-action series is based on the popular Korean webtoon of the same name by Hongjacga. Most Americans are probably unfamiliar with the source material, but South Korean programming has proved to be quite popular in the US, as evidenced by Netflix series like zombie period drama Kingdom and this year's Squid Game. The latter is currently Netflix's most-watched series to date, reaching over 142 million households during its first month. So it's no wonder that Apple TV wants to emulate that success with Dr. Brain. Per the official premise: \"The series follows a brilliant brain scientist Sewon (Lee Sun-kyun) who suffers a horrific personal tragedy when his family falls victim to a mysterious accident. Desperate to uncover what happened, he goes to extraordinary lengths to solve the tragic mystery by conducting 'brain syncs' with the dead to access their memories for clues.\" The series also stars Lee You-young, Park Hee-soon, Seo Ji-hye, and Lee Jae-won.Read 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

Fans of the Oscar-winning film Parasite will recognize the star of Dr. Brain , a new sci-fi thriller from Apple TV+. Lee Sun-kyun, who played Park Dong-Ik in Bong Joon-ho's film , plays a brilliant brain surgeon who seeks to find out the truth about the tragic accident that befell his wife and son.

Advertisement The trailer opens with the image of a young boy with sensors attached to his head, presumably to detect brain signals. \"That child has a very unique brain\u2014a new type of genius,\" a voiceover says, and the image then cuts to the adult Sewon wearing the same setup. We see him hard at work on his research, which is focused on accessing the thoughts and memories of other people. Then we flash back to a brief, happy memory of Sewon with his wife and son, and we get a glimpse of the tragedy that befell them. It's not long before Sewon is conducting experiments with corpses in his laboratory, attempting to hack their memories. We only see fragments: a house fire (that may have been deliberately set); a barking dog; a distraught young woman, hands clasped as if in prayer; and a recurring admonition to \"find our son.\" All those memory fragments are impossibly tangled in Sewon's head, and he must figure out how to make sense of them. \"The memories feel like hallucinations,\" Sewon says. \"My mind is in chaos.\" It looks like Sewon is also a suspect in a murder, since we see two homicide detectives pay him a visit, assuring him that they will be watching. All in all, it looks like a spookily surreal series. Dr. Brain debuts on Apple TV+ on November 3, 2021, in the US and globally on November 4, 2021. Listing image by Apple TV+",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin FABSCRAP has a textile warehouse in Brooklyn and will open a second in Philadelphia next month. FABSCRAP The fashion industry contributes 10% of global carbon emissions\u2014far more than air travel. Part of this is straight up waste\u2014fabric tossed before or after sale that ends up in landfills. \u201cWe can do way better than this,\u201d says Jessica Schreiber, co-founder of FABSCRAP , an organization that reduces and recycles textile waste. Launched in 2017, FABSCRAP works with over 500 fashion brands\u2014from Oscar de la Renta to Macy\u2019s to J.Crew\u2014and this week announced an expansion to Philadelphia. We caught up with Schreiber for more. Ashoka: Jessica, fashion waste is a problem most consumers don\u2019t see. When did you come across this? Jessica Schreiber: In grad school. I was studying climate science at Columbia. And I applied\u2014begged, really\u2014to intern with the Department of Sanitation just as it was rolling out a clothing recycling program, ReFashioned NYC. So over the next five years, I got to help develop this. I also got to know the city's thrift infrastructure really well, and that\u2019s when I first saw the volume of textile waste. Together, the five boroughs throw out 200,000 tons of textile waste every year - that\u2019s 14 times the physical weight of the Brooklyn Bridge. Every year! That was my introduction to fashion's impact on the planet. Ashoka: You work along the supply chain, starting upstream of the consumer. Tell us why you chose that. Schreiber: I found two things really eye-opening while at the Department of Sanitation. One, companies were passing on the responsibility for recycling and disposal to the consumer. But whether or not an item is recyclable is a design decision\u2014that's why I wanted to start with the maker of the products. And two, I was hearing from the brands themselves about the textile waste they were creating as part of the design process. About 30 companies reached out to me about this. But the Department of Sanitation doesn't handle commercial waste and so we couldn't fit it into their programming. That\u2019s where the idea for FABSCRAP came in. We thought: let\u2019s help businesses reduce their waste and create the same thrift infrastructure for raw materials that exists for used goods. Ashoka: Can you tell us what happens to fabric when it arrives at your warehouse and gets sorted. Some of it ends up in the shredder, right? Schreiber: Yes\u2014so what we\u2019re talking about here is actually downcycling. We can shred any fabric of any blend, as long as there's no spandex in it. The result is fluffy fiber pulp called shoddy that is used in many things: insulation, carpet padding, mattress stuffing, moving blankets, even refrigerated meal delivery boxes. So this is not technically recycling\u2014it\u2019s substantially extending the life of fibers. Looking ahead, the industry is seeing development in fiber to fiber recycling, like 100% cotton being mechanically or chemically manipulated to become a fiber again. This process is not quite ready for use at industrial scale, but it\u2019s coming and we\u2019re excited about it\u2014and we\u2019re already sorting for it. For other waste\u2014fabrics and even materials such as scrap leather\u2014we redistribute or resell. We have fabric thrift stores in our warehouses, including now in Philadelphia, that are open to the public, plus an online store. Our warehouse volunteers\u2014the volunteer pool is 7,000 people now in Brooklyn\u2014can take home five pounds of fabric for free from a shift. In addition, we do pop-ups at fashion schools around the country, bringing designer fabric directly to students. And it's all thrift store prices and really high quality. As students enter internships or take their first career steps, we hope they\u2019ll have a new perspective on waste and design in ways that are responsible and contribute to industry-wide waste reduction.

Schreiber: Consumers are starting to care quite a bit about the end of life options of clothes\u2014including whether pieces are made to last long enough to reuse or repair. Gen Z and some younger Millennials are on board, but they aren\u2019t the group we have to convince that reuse and repair is cool, sincethey already look for vintage stuff from the 90s and early 2000s. But for older millennials into boomers, thrift is still stigmatized. That said, we have to be careful that thrifting doesn\u2019t become gentrified. At FABSCRAP we want to make sure we don\u2019t price out the communities who traditionally used and needed these lower price points. Ashoka: And what about clothing brands? Schreiber: As for brands, every FABSCRAP partner receives a report of their diversion metrics, which are materials that can be kept from the landfill when initially wasted. We are able to let brands know how much gets recycled, reused, what went to landfill and why. For example, spandex cannot be recycled at this time. So we help brands see that using spandex will decrease their diversion numbers, that any item they produce with spandex cannot be recycled. This is feedback they aren\u2019t necessarily getting from consumers. and forward-looking companies, CEOs, and design teams, are able to look ahead and position their brand accordingly. Ashoka: Besides providing new performance metrics, how do you help brands improve? Schreiber: Well, we\u2019re first of all replacing the verb \u201cdonate.\u201d It costs FABSCRAP to collect, sort, sell, and shred. So donating fabric isn\u2019t really accurate. Even though we\u2019re a nonprofit, we charge a service fee, the same way that any trash collector does. Our offer: we\u2019ll recycle your textiles. That helps establish that this is a waste commodity stream and that not all of it is usable. We want this waste to be part of the company\u2019s bottom line. The bigger point we\u2019re making is about incentives: for brands concerned about cost, the solution is to create less waste\u2014and we\u2019ll help them with that, too. Naturally, the landfill will always be our biggest competition, because it\u2019s cheaper on the surface, but brands can\u2019t market sending 15,000 pounds to landfill. They can market recycling 15,000 pounds through FABSCRAP\u2014and increasingly, consumers and investors are paying attention to these new metrics. Ashoka: Further up the supply chain, is there a role for fabric mills? Schreiber: Yes, there are some process improvements we want to work on together with brands and mills. The fabric sampling process is one. After gathering textile waste for three years from 500 brands, we realized that 75% of what we pick up are fabric swatches. At the start of each season, mills send new swatches to the designers in their network, as it's basically a marketing tool for them. Designers don't always ask for these and most go of these 6x6 inch squares go straight to the trash. To reuse, we need one yard or more. So as more and more things become shared digitally, one yard of fabric with all of the digital information is possible and would create significantly less waste. This could also help mills offset costs and invite brands to be part of the selection process. Ashoka: At the macro level, are there policy levers we should be paying attention to? Schreiber: I\u2019m a big fan of extended producer responsibility policies and legislation that essentially puts the responsibility for the end of life of a product on the producer of that product. This exists for some product categories: for example, New York passed this for electronics. iIf you are a retailer and you sell electronics in New York State, you have to also purchase credits that fund the recycling of those electronics. The in-state sales volume determines how many credits you have to buy, so this is important practically and in terms of mindset change and incentives alignment. The result? It nudges companies to design products and administer returns differently and make items that can be deconstructed into recyclable or reusable parts. As these policy tools gain traction, we\u2019re working with our brands to step up as vanguard companies, and get recognized by consumers and other industry players for taking proactive first steps. Ashoka: Looking ahead, what are you hopeful about? Schreiber: I really hope companies begin to see themselves as stewards of the planet, take responsibility for their impact, and work to reduce it. There is a lot we can do as individuals, but businesses have exponentially more influence, power, and impact with their choices. I hope we move in a direction that is beyond sustainability and ask ourselves: How can we evolve and build companies that are truly regenerative?",

Blue Origin describes the station as a \u201cmixed used business park\" in space. Orbital Reef will reside in a low Earth orbit at 310 miles, and function as a hub for research, commerce, tourism and logistics, where spaceships can also come and go. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a company that wants to manufacture materials in space,\u201d Blue Origin says in a video about the project. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a school that wants to send an experiment up. Maybe there\u2019s a nation that\u2019s ready to send someone into low-Earth orbit to inspire their entire nation.\u201d The company also envisions the station supplying the infrastructure to commercialize space travel. \u201cThe station will open the next chapter of human space exploration and development by facilitating the growth of a vibrant ecosystem and business model for the future,\u201d it adds. In addition, the company is designing Orbital Reef to be expandable. Enterprise customers from across the globe will be able to dock new pod-like modules onto the station. \u201cWe will expand access, lower the cost, and provide all the services and amenities needed to normalize space flight,\u201d adds Blue Origin SVP Brent Sherwood. To build the station, Blue Origin has recruited Sierra Space , a company that specializes in building life-support modules for outer space, as a strategic partner. Meanwhile, Boeing will provide crew and cargo transportation through the company\u2019s Starliner spaceship. Another company called Genesis Engineering Solutions is developing a single-person spacecraft for the Orbital Reef station. Together, the companies plan on providing an \u201cend-to-end service\u201d for the station covering transportation, logistics, leased space, and amenities. But obviously, the major challenge will be developing the spaceships and technology capable of constructing and maintaining Orbital Reef. The companies didn\u2019t offer a firm timetable on the station\u2019s development, but they expect Orbital Reef to become a premier destination for space travel by the end of this decade.",

    "content": "The last year and a half has been a major eye opener for countless industries. As many white-collar employees have moved from offices to remote work, it has drawn into sharp focus just how ill-equipped many home setups are for hour after hour of Zoom calls. Even as sales of PCs and tablets saw a major spike in 2020, consumer electronics companies weren\u2019t particularly swift to react \u2014 not especially surprising, as the timeline to bring products to market is long, with many unannounced products still in the pipeline. Arriving today, as a free update on compatible systems, macOS 12 Monterey (in part) introduces some key features introduced in an era of remote work \u2014 and life. And it\u2019s likely not a coincidence that the new operating system arrives as Apple hardware, like the MacBook Pro and M1-powered iMac, is finally getting long-overdue upgrades to their camera and microphone setups. For Apple, that means FaceTime. The company is in a bit of peculiar position on the teleconferencing front, in that \u2014 unlike, say Microsoft or Google \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have a business teleconferencing platform. Last year, Apple added the ability to host up to 32 people on a call, which certainly opens things up, but as it stands, there\u2019s no \u201cFaceTime for Business.\u201d This is a friends and family deal. Apple\u2019s video calling app gets some key upgrades this time around. The top of the list addition is SharePlay, which unfortunately has been delayed on desktop and is currently set for a release at some point later this fall. It\u2019s also largely expected to arrive on the soon-to-drop iOS 15.1. The feature is effectively a built-in version of the watch-together features that rolled out last year for streaming services at the height of the pandemic. Image Credits: Apple The feature is custom made to support Apple\u2019s own services TV+ and Apple Music, and will work with a handful of launch partners, including Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, the NBA app, Twitch, TikTok, MasterClass, Zillow, Paramount+ and ESPN+. It\u2019s a healthy cross section of services, but there are some bigger names that are notably absent, including Netflix, Amazon and Spotify. The feature effectively syncs up video and audio content, allowing users in the group to react to what they\u2019re seeing/hearing in real time. Volume adjusts around speakers\u2019 audio and playback is synced when a user plays/pauses/fast forwards/rewinds. Users will also be able to extend the feature onto a set with an Apple TV. Also new is a share screen feature, similar to what you\u2019ll find on a service like Zoom, letting you present windows to other viewers on the call. Spatial Audio comes to FaceTime, as well. I recently tried it out while testing the latest AirPods and dug the feature, which uses the position of a speaker\u2019s window to place their audio in that approximate location. It\u2019s a little gimmick for now, but it\u2019s a neat one. One of the most interesting additions this time out is the ability to join a FaceTime call outside of the Apple ecosystem. Functionality is still limited, but users can create a link, which others can join on Android or Windows devices, through the Chrome or Edge browser. Users don\u2019t need an account to join the call, but someone needs to let them in after clicking the link. Image Credits: Brian Heater Also new is Portrait Mode \u2014 which, again, works similarly to the blur background function we\u2019ve seen on the leading teleconferencing services. Apple says the addition uses the Neural Engine found on the M1. Both this feature and Spatial Audio are only available on systems with the M1 chip, though the blurring of the line the new chips represent for developers seems to point to an acceleration in the adoption of iOS features on macOS. This is a nice change from the days of waiting a couple of updates to see mobile features hit the desktop. Once again, Safari receives some of the biggest updates here, along with its rethink on mobile. The biggest aesthetic change is a fairly radical move away from the universal search bar. The new \u201ccompact tab bar\u201d moves tabs into small, discrete windows as a space saver. Given how much of a pain such a change can be, Apple is smartly leaving this something you can enable or disable in settings. Understanding that this is currently a browser tab world and we\u2019re just living in it, Tab Groups lets users share them in bunches, so you can, say, have a \u201cwork\u201d or \u201chome\u201d collection. Depending on how you work, that\u2019s either a boon to creativity or another opportunity to cram a bunch of bookmarks away. Highlighting and right clicking text on a page now lets you add a \u201cQuick Note,\u201d collating all of that information into a single place. It\u2019s a nice addition for those who do a lot of online research. Focus, which was announced as part of iOS 15, let\u2019s you mediate distractions based on activities or times of day. You can, say, limit notifications when you\u2019re meditating, reading, working, etc. These settings are automatically synced across Apple devices. Silenced notifications will also be noted in your messenger app, so people know when you don\u2019t want to be disturbed. AirPlay to Mac is a long-awaited new feature that, well, does what it says on the tin, effectively letting you cast music, movies and the like to a Mac using AirPlay 2. Makes sense, particularly if you\u2019ve got an iMac and a perfectly good screen and speakers. Universal Control \u2014 one of the more eagerly awaited additions here \u2014 is also coming later in the fall. The feature will further blur the line between iPadOS and Mac, letting users drag and drop items between the two for a more seamless AirDrop experience. The two devices can also be controlled by the same peripheral simultaneously, including a keyboard, trackpad or mouse. The other big addition here is Shortcuts, the latest feature to be ported over from iOS. The app is effectively replacing long-time favorite Automator, which will be going away at some point in the future. As it stands, shortcut is simpler but may ultimately lack the sophistication of Automator, so Apple is cushioning the blow by letting users convert Automator sequences into Short Cuts. It will keep Automator around for a while, however, as it solicits feedback from users. MacOS Monterey is available now for iMacs from 2015 and older, iMac Pro 2017 and later, MacBook Air/Pro early-2015 and later, Mac Pro 2013 and later, Mac mini 2014 and later and MacBook early-2016 and later.",

Users don\u2019t need an account to join the call, but someone needs to let them in after clicking the link. Image Credits: Brian Heater Also new is Portrait Mode \u2014 which, again, works similarly to the blur background function we\u2019ve seen on the leading teleconferencing services. Apple says the addition uses the Neural Engine found on the M1. Both this feature and Spatial Audio are only available on systems with the M1 chip, though the blurring of the line the new chips represent for developers seems to point to an acceleration in the adoption of iOS features on macOS. This is a nice change from the days of waiting a couple of updates to see mobile features hit the desktop. Once again, Safari receives some of the biggest updates here, along with its rethink on mobile. The biggest aesthetic change is a fairly radical move away from the universal search bar. The new \u201ccompact tab bar\u201d moves tabs into small, discrete windows as a space saver. Given how much of a pain such a change can be, Apple is smartly leaving this something you can enable or disable in settings. Understanding that this is currently a browser tab world and we\u2019re just living in it, Tab Groups lets users share them in bunches, so you can, say, have a \u201cwork\u201d or \u201chome\u201d collection. Depending on how you work, that\u2019s either a boon to creativity or another opportunity to cram a bunch of bookmarks away. Highlighting and right clicking text on a page now lets you add a \u201cQuick Note,\u201d collating all of that information into a single place. It\u2019s a nice addition for those who do a lot of online research. Focus, which was announced as part of iOS 15, let\u2019s you mediate distractions based on activities or times of day. You can, say, limit notifications when you\u2019re meditating, reading, working, etc. These settings are automatically synced across Apple devices. Silenced notifications will also be noted in your messenger app, so people know when you don\u2019t want to be disturbed. AirPlay to Mac is a long-awaited new feature that, well, does what it says on the tin, effectively letting you cast music, movies and the like to a Mac using AirPlay 2. Makes sense, particularly if you\u2019ve got an iMac and a perfectly good screen and speakers. Universal Control \u2014 one of the more eagerly awaited additions here \u2014 is also coming later in the fall. The feature will further blur the line between iPadOS and Mac, letting users drag and drop items between the two for a more seamless AirDrop experience. The two devices can also be controlled by the same peripheral simultaneously, including a keyboard, trackpad or mouse. The other big addition here is Shortcuts, the latest feature to be ported over from iOS. The app is effectively replacing long-time favorite Automator, which will be going away at some point in the future. As it stands, shortcut is simpler but may ultimately lack the sophistication of Automator, so Apple is cushioning the blow by letting users convert Automator sequences into Short Cuts. It will keep Automator around for a while, however, as it solicits feedback from users. MacOS Monterey is available now for iMacs from 2015 and older, iMac Pro 2017 and later, MacBook Air/Pro early-2015 and later, Mac Pro 2013 and later, Mac mini 2014 and later and MacBook early-2016 and later.",

Weber also was not impressed with the company or its leadership. For one thing, Theranos had not provided a list of tests it was running on its proprietary devices, which Weber asked for to \u201cmake sure we\u2019re both working with the same deck of cards.\u201d Then there was the report . Theranos had provided a technical document prepared by its scientists.

Furthermore, during a one-hour conference call with Holmes, he said that \u201cTheranos has provided non-informative, tangential, deflective, or evasive answers to a written set of technical due diligence questions.\u201d Advertisement In January 2009, Weber essentially ended his company\u2019s dealings with Theranos\u2014he confirmed with Theranos that Pfizer had paid what it owed as part of a $900,000 exploratory deal. After that, he said, he was not aware of any further \u201cmeaningful\u201d interactions between the two companies. Weber revealed in cross-examination that he never sent his findings to Theranos. And yet Holmes was using the Pfizer logo in her pitches. Where did the \u201cPfizer\u201d document come from? It was essentially the same Theranos report that Holmes had sent to Pfizer, prosecutors pointed out, the same one that Weber described as \u201cnot believable.\u201d In court, jurors were shown a \u201cPfizer\u201d document that Holmes had sent to Walgreens executives in April 2010. \u201cWould it be fair to say in 2010 or after that Pfizer endorsed Theranos technology?\u201d assistant US attorney Robert Leach asked Weber. \u201cUh, no,\u201d Weber said, adding that no Pfizer employee had approved that document or its conclusions.",

    "full_description": "Lung cancer can be elusive to spot and difficult to treat because the markers for it are found in other tissues, too. Now, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign researchers have developed a finely tuned molecular agent that can target lung and other cancer cells for imaging and treatment. In a paper published in the journal Nature Chemistry , the researchers described the molecule's ability to target lung cancer cells , image them and deliver targeted treatment in cultures of human cancer cell lines as well as in live mice. The researchers picked a surprising biomarker to target: glutathione, a molecule naturally produced in tissues throughout the body but expressed in greater quantities in lung cancer. Because of its ubiquity, they said, it has not been a good target for treatments such as chemotherapy. \"One of the biggest issues with developing diagnostic tools or targeted drugs is off-target effects,\" said Illinois chemistry professor Jefferson Chan, who conducted the study with graduate student Melissa Lucero. \"When you give a patient a chemotherapeutic, it's kind of an arms race: You're killing the cancer cells, but you're also killing the rest of the body because so many things are similar. We used a unique chemistry approach to tune the reactivity of our molecule, so that we're targeting what would typically be considered a bad biomarker.\" The researchers tuned the dynamic range of the molecule so that it would not react to glutathione under healthy conditions but would react with the excess glutathione made by cancer cells. The researchers paired their targeting molecule with an agent for photoacoustic imaging, so that they could see where it was reacting and verify that it was targeting the lung cancer. The imaging agent responds to light and gives off an acoustic signal that can be picked up by an ultrasound transducer. \"It's a light-in, sound-out technique. It has a lot of advantages over traditional medical imaging. This imaging is powerful because of its resolution, its safety profile and its ability to interact with these designer molecules that tell us so much information at the molecular level,\" Chan said. \"There are hand-held and laparoscopic light devices that seamlessly integrate with ultrasound machines in hospitals, so we know when we develop molecules like this there are clinical applications.\" The researchers first tested the new molecule's imaging capabilities in cell cultures and found that it distinguished between healthy and cancerous cells. To gage the diagnostic potential, they performed a blind study in live mice, using the photoacoustic probe to identify which mice in a cohort had lung cancer tumors. This study marks the first time that photoacoustic imaging has been successfully applied in lung tissue, Lucero said. Then, the researchers explored whether their targeted approach could be used to deliver treatment directly to the site of cancer cells, which would eliminate the biggest drawback of chemotherapy and other cancer treatments: toxicity to the whole body. They created a prodrug, dubbed PARx, that combines their targeted imaging probe with a powerful chemotherapy drug and tested it in the mice. They found that PARx inhibited tumor growth, without the mice displaying signs or symptoms of off-target toxic effects such as weight loss or liver damage. In contrast, a group of mice that received a control instead of the drug had significant tumor growth over the three-week treatment course. \"We found we could use high doses or frequent doses of the drug with no off-target effects,\" Lucero said. \"Then we did some more experiments in other clinically relevant mouse models, finding and treating cancer that had metastasized to the liver as well as primary tumors, which shows the potential for broad application of this approach.\" Next, the researchers are working to improve the selectivity and detection capabilities even further so that they can detect micro-metastases, or tiny clusters where the cancer has spread, anywhere in the body. They are also looking to apply their approach to other biomarkers, creating fine-tuned targeting molecules for other cancers. \"When you're targeting a disease like lung cancer , something that's a death sentence for a lot of people, you know it should be possible to diagnose it at an early stage, before symptoms manifest, by simply going after the right biomarker,\" Chan said. \"Now we have the first steps to be able to diagnose it, and also there's hope for treatment, because by using chemistry, we can counter the toxicity of these drugs and actually make them safe for general application.\" Explore further",

    "description": "The Climate Change Advisory Council has finalised its recommendations for two, five-year carbon budgets aimed at reducing the State\u2019s carbon emissions by 51 per cent by 2030. The average year-on-year reductions in the first \u201cbudget\u201d to 2025 has been set at just under 4.8 per cent, while the average year-on-year reductions in the second budget to 2030 is set at 8.3 per cent. The advisory council, which includes leading climate scientists and energy experts, accepts the most significant reductions will be towards the end of the decade \u2013 as key investments will take time to kick in \u2013 but it warns urgency is required in the meantime. The key figures are a limit on emissions for 2021-2025 of 295 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent and a 200 million tonnes CO2 limit for 2026-2030 relative to a 2018 baseline. The carbon budget for 2031-2035, which is provisional, is recommended at 151 million tonnes CO2. The ceilings set out the total amount of emissions allowed under two five-year carbon budgets. The Government must now set out how they will be applied to each sector, including the most challenging activities in transport, agriculture, heating, power generation and carbon-intensive industry. Once adopted by Cabinet and the Oireachtas, the Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan will use each carbon budget to prepare sectoral emissions ceilings for relevant sectors of the economy in consultation with other relevant Ministers. The Climate Action Bill, signed into law in July, put in place a legally binding commitment that the State must reduce carbon emissions by 51 per cent by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. On Monday, the council said \u201cstrong, rapid and sustained reductions in emissions\u201d in all sectors and all greenhouses gases were required to meet the climate challenge facing Ireland. Issuing its recommendations to the Government on emission ceilings that must apply up to 2030, it says: \u201cThe proposed carbon budgets will require transformational changes for society and the economy which are necessary; failing to act on climate change would have grave consequences.\u201d It is critically important that potential for adverse impacts is addressed, it continues. \u201cIndividuals and communities at risk of loss of employment or disproportionate costs need to be identified and assisted in making the transition. The impact of these changes will require significant Government action with budgetary implications that need to be included in medium-term planning.\u201d The advisory council highlights that social and economic impacts can be mitigated by appropriate policies and supportive infrastructures, \u201cwhile opportunities arising from a green reputation, and innovation in products and services to support the low carbon economy should be seized\u201d. Ireland emitted 68.3 million tonnes of CO2 in 2018. Therefore, the first two carbon budgets must be consistent with emissions being cut to 33.5 million tonnes CO2 by 2030. \u201cThis is a very significant challenge for our society and economy while we also grapple with other societal challenges such as the Covid pandemic, Brexit and housing,\u201d the council pointed out in its report to the Government. The budgets are consistent with the Government\u2019s commitment to halving greenhouse gases by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, council chair Marie Donnelly confirmed. \u201cThe carbon budgets provide a framework, but what is urgently required is transformative change which is led by all of Government on a sustained basis, supported by all sectors of the economy, and all members of society. This will require significant investment across the economy,\u201d she said. The budget is based on the best available science and defines \u201can appropriate and necessary path\u201d to addressing the climate challenge and for Ireland to comply with international commitments. \u201cMany of the changes required will only have a real impact on emissions in the second period,\u201d Ms Donnelly accepted. The council does not believe a 7 per cent per annum reduction \u2013 set out in the programme for government \u2013 in the first carbon budget is appropriate. However, the carbon budget programme for the decade \u201crequires immediate action and investment in the first period . . . to deliver the accelerated reductions (in excess of 7 per cent annum) in the second carbon budget period required to meet the 2030 target of a 51 per cent reduction\u201d. Methane The council endorses the need \u201cfor a strong, rapid and sustained reduction in methane emissions\u201d as set out recently in a UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, but acknowledges this is challenging in agriculture. About 93 per cent of Irish methane emissions come from livestock-based agriculture, which are particularly hard to mitigate without changing output levels \u2013 ie cattle numbers. New methane-based mitigation pathways (changing animal diet, additives and genetics) are being investigated in Ireland and internationally, which may deliver methane reductions in future, it finds. A critical issue in the Irish context is \u201cagricultural emissions are not offset by sequestration actions provided by the land use, land use change and forestry\u201d. This means based on EPA scenarios, land use will still be an overall source of emissions in 2030. The CCAC outlines different combinations of reductions in dairy and suckler beef numbers could deliver emissions reductions but is not prescriptive. It cites Teagasc analysis which concludes only relatively small reductions in agricultural emissions can be achieved by \u201ccurrently proven technical mitigation alone\u201d and under all scenarios analysed these alone are insufficient to leave agriculture within any of the core carbon budget scenarios considered. Larger reductions in agricultural emissions \u201crequire both actions to achieve technical mitigation and actions to reduce livestock agricultural activity with reductions in beef and/or dairy activity contributing increasing shares of the reduction in agricultural GHG [greenhouse gases] across the progressively more ambitious carbon budget scenarios\u201d. Transport The carbon budget scenarios for the energy sector suggest a need to maximise electrification of cars and vans with an associated requirement for expansion of charging infrastructure. The scenarios see a range of between 600,000 to 1.5 million battery electric vehicles by 2030 to meet targets along with 130,000 battery EV vans. \u201cThe more ambitious scenarios for the energy sector would effectively mean all new car registrations would have to be battery electric vehicles before 2030 with significant early scrappage of ICE [internal combustion engine] vehicles. Additional biofuel blending will also be necessary,\u201d it adds. A reduction in transport demand and mode switching from private car transport to public and active transport could reduce transition costs as well as having important co-benefits related to improving health and easing congestion, the CCAC finds. Land use planning and public transport infrastructure would have an important role to play in this. The CCAC modelling suggests \u201ca complete removal of coal and peat for residential heating and up to 600,000 retrofits of houses between 2020 and 2030\u201d. This means upgrading homes to a B2 energy rating or \u201ccost optimal standard\u201d by 2030, of which 35,000 would be houses owned by local authorities. This would mean an 80 per cent reduction in kerosene use and largescale electrification for home heating, it suggests. Heat pumps or electrification are also foreseen for space heating in the commercial sector. Climate Justice The CCAC stresses the need for climate action in the context of a just transition. \u201cIndividuals and communities who are vulnerable or at risk of loss of employment or livelihood, or disproportionate costs need to be identified and assisted in the transition,\u201d it adds. The importance of providing policy supports aimed at alternative forms of income for small and medium enterprises, farmers and other impacted households \u201cshould be considered urgently\u201d. The CCAC concludes it is possible to implement carbon budgets while protecting and enhancing biodiversity. \u201cHowever, it is critical further pressure on biodiversity from all aspects of climate mitigation measures is avoided, in particular from poor siting of renewable energy infrastructure and inappropriate land-use change such as over reliance on, or poor siting of, mono-species afforestation,\u201d it warns. Care must be taken, it adds, to identify and implement measures which deliver \u201csynergistic gains\u201d for climate mitigation, biodiversity protection and restoration and river catchment resilience by improving water quality. The 51 per cent target applies to GHGs \u201cattributable to industrial, agricultural, energy, land use and other anthropogenic activities in the State\u201d. It does not include emissions from international aviation or shipping but this may be re-considered in the context of the next programme of carbon budgets and international developments in the interim, it says. Dr Cara Augustenborg, environmental scientist and member of the advisory council, described the budgets as \u201chistoric\u201d, and said \u201cwe are officially on the road to bending the emissions curve in Ireland\u201d. Welcoming the outcome of the council\u2019s deliberations, Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan said: \u201cWhen we passed the Climate Act in July we embedded the process of carbon budgeting into law. \u201cThe Act also strengthened the role of the Climate Change Advisory Council, to empower this independent body to do this important work, based on the most up-to-date climate science. These first carbon budgets are a significant milestone in our efforts to tackle climate change. \u201cThe first two five-year carbon budgets equate to a total reduction of 51 per cent emissions over the period to 2030. This is part of the journey towards \u2018net zero\u2019, which commits us to the transition to a \u2018climate resilient, biodiversity rich, environmentally sustainable and climate neutral economy\u2019 no later than 2050. \u201cThe Government will shortly publish Climate Action Plan 2021. Every sector of the economy will need to play its part. \u201cThere will be different targets for each sector, based on their respective starting points and the relative difficulty, cost, speed and benefits of reducing emissions. \u201cThis will be challenging and will require fundamental changes in many parts of Irish life, but it is also an opportunity to create a cleaner, greener economy and society that cuts emissions, creates jobs and protects our people and the planet,\u201d Mr Ryan said.",

    "full_description": "The Climate Change Advisory Council has finalised its recommendations for two, five-year carbon budgets aimed at reducing the State\u2019s carbon emissions by 51 per cent by 2030. The average year-on-year reductions in the first \u201cbudget\u201d to 2025 has been set at just under 4.8 per cent, while the average year-on-year reductions in the second budget to 2030 is set at 8.3 per cent. The advisory council, which includes leading climate scientists and energy experts, accepts the most significant reductions will be towards the end of the decade \u2013 as key investments will take time to kick in \u2013 but it warns urgency is required in the meantime. The key figures are a limit on emissions for 2021-2025 of 295 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent and a 200 million tonnes CO2 limit for 2026-2030 relative to a 2018 baseline. The carbon budget for 2031-2035, which is provisional, is recommended at 151 million tonnes CO2. The ceilings set out the total amount of emissions allowed under two five-year carbon budgets. The Government must now set out how they will be applied to each sector, including the most challenging activities in transport, agriculture, heating, power generation and carbon-intensive industry. Once adopted by Cabinet and the Oireachtas , the Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan will use each carbon budget to prepare sectoral emissions ceilings for relevant sectors of the economy in consultation with other relevant Ministers. The Climate Action Bill, signed into law in July, put in place a legally binding commitment that the State must reduce carbon emissions by 51 per cent by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. On Monday, the council said \u201cstrong, rapid and sustained reductions in emissions\u201d in all sectors and all greenhouses gases were required to meet the climate challenge facing Ireland . Issuing its recommendations to the Government on emission ceilings that must apply up to 2030, it says: \u201cThe proposed carbon budgets will require transformational changes for society and the economy which are necessary; failing to act on climate change would have grave consequences.\u201d It is critically important that potential for adverse impacts is addressed, it continues. \u201cIndividuals and communities at risk of loss of employment or disproportionate costs need to be identified and assisted in making the transition. The impact of these changes will require significant Government action with budgetary implications that need to be included in medium-term planning.\u201d The advisory council highlights that social and economic impacts can be mitigated by appropriate policies and supportive infrastructures, \u201cwhile opportunities arising from a green reputation, and innovation in products and services to support the low carbon economy should be seized\u201d. Ireland emitted 68.3 million tonnes of CO2 in 2018. Therefore, the first two carbon budgets must be consistent with emissions being cut to 33.5 million tonnes CO2 by 2030. \u201cThis is a very significant challenge for our society and economy while we also grapple with other societal challenges such as the Covid pandemic, Brexit and housing,\u201d the council pointed out in its report to the Government. The budgets are consistent with the Government\u2019s commitment to halving greenhouse gases by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, council chair Marie Donnelly confirmed. \u201cThe carbon budgets provide a framework, but what is urgently required is transformative change which is led by all of Government on a sustained basis, supported by all sectors of the economy, and all members of society. This will require significant investment across the economy,\u201d she said. The budget is based on the best available science and defines \u201can appropriate and necessary path\u201d to addressing the climate challenge and for Ireland to comply with international commitments. \u201cMany of the changes required will only have a real impact on emissions in the second period,\u201d Ms Donnelly accepted. The council does not believe a 7 per cent per annum reduction \u2013 set out in the programme for government \u2013 in the first carbon budget is appropriate. However, the carbon budget programme for the decade \u201crequires immediate action and investment in the first period . . . to deliver the accelerated reductions (in excess of 7 per cent annum) in the second carbon budget period required to meet the 2030 target of a 51 per cent reduction\u201d. The council endorses the need \u201cfor a strong, rapid and sustained reduction in methane emissions\u201d as set out recently in a UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, but acknowledges this is challenging in agriculture. About 93 per cent of Irish methane emissions come from livestock-based agriculture, which are particularly hard to mitigate without changing output levels \u2013 ie cattle numbers. New methane-based mitigation pathways (changing animal diet, additives and genetics) are being investigated in Ireland and internationally, which may deliver methane reductions in future, it finds. A critical issue in the Irish context is \u201cagricultural emissions are not offset by sequestration actions provided by the land use, land use change and forestry\u201d. This means based on EPA scenarios, land use will still be an overall source of emissions in 2030. The CCAC outlines different combinations of reductions in dairy and suckler beef numbers could deliver emissions reductions but is not prescriptive. It cites Teagasc analysis which concludes only relatively small reductions in agricultural emissions can be achieved by \u201ccurrently proven technical mitigation alone\u201d and under all scenarios analysed these alone are insufficient to leave agriculture within any of the core carbon budget scenarios considered. Larger reductions in agricultural emissions \u201crequire both actions to achieve technical mitigation and actions to reduce livestock agricultural activity with reductions in beef and/or dairy activity contributing increasing shares of the reduction in agricultural GHG [greenhouse gases] across the progressively more ambitious carbon budget scenarios\u201d. The carbon budget scenarios for the energy sector suggest a need to maximise electrification of cars and vans with an associated requirement for expansion of charging infrastructure.

At the time of their discovery, scientists believed the three birdlike tracks had been made 200 million to 250 million years ago by a two-legged predator. The tracks were the first evidence that dinosaurs roamed Australia in the Triassic, when the creatures first appeared on the planet. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png By 2003, some paleontologists even suspected that the footprints represented the world\u2019s earliest evidence of a giant carnivorous dinosaur, one that may have stood up to 6 1/2 feet high at the hip. But new analysis has brought down this Australian idol. The tracks belonged to a smaller, meeker herbivore no taller than a person, not a ferocious giant carnivore, scientists said in a paper published Thursday in the journal Historical Biology . I threw this diagram together for a SVP fieldtrip in 2019 (remember in-person conferences?).

The tracks likely belonged to a two-legged ancestor of the giant, long-necked, four-legged sauropods that evolved later in the Mesozoic Era. Also read | Patagonian fossils show Jurassic dinosaur had herd mentality \u201cIt\u2019s the only occurrence of these bipedal forms of these dinosaurs in Australia,\u201d Romilio said. Sauropods are not found again in the continent\u2019s fossil record for about 50 million more years. Miners laboring in a tunnel some 700 feet below the Earth\u2019s surface near Brisbane were the first to spot the prints. As the miners excavated coal, the fossilized tracks, each larger than a dinner plate, took shape in the darkness. \u201cHaving a bird footprint, a gigantic bird footprint on the ceiling, that\u2019s something to tell someone about,\u201d Romilio said.

In a 1964 paper on the discovery, Henry Ross Edgar Staines, a paleontologist with the Geological Survey of Queensland, and J.T. Woods of the Queensland Museum measured the biggest track at nearly 17 inches from heel to the tip of the longest toe. They declared it to be Eubrontes, a genus of fossilised footprints left by upright carnivores. A plaster cast of the print was placed on display in the Queensland Museum. An undated image provided by Anthony Romilio shows a 3-D image of footprints, first found in a mining tunnel in the 1960s. (Anthony Romilio via The New York Times) After the mine\u2019s closure, that cast and a simple, cartoonlike drawing of the three footprints included in the 1964 paper were the only visual records of the tracks that researchers could access. Scientific publications over the years described the largest print as anywhere from 15 to 18 inches, Romilio said. When Romilio and his colleagues analysed the plaster cast using advanced 3D imaging techniques, a number of discrepancies with those earlier accounts emerged. Indentations at the front of the print appeared to be drag marks left by the dinosaur\u2019s claws, not impressions of the claws themselves. A bump near the heel that previous researchers measured as part of the foot was actually part of the rock surrounding the fossil. Also read | Volcanic eruptions helped dinosaurs dominate Earth Further comparisons showed the tracks shared more characteristics with Evazoum, a genus of plant-eating dinosaur prints, than the carnivorous Eubrontes: an inward-pointing gait, a shorter middle toe, splayed toes and a narrower overall foot. The researchers now believe the largest track is 13 inches long, and belonged to a dinosaur that stood about 4 1/2 feet high at the hip. Ross Staines, the paleontologist who first published on the prints, died in 1996. His daughter, Dr. Roslyn Dick, believes he would have welcomed the new insight into his findings.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Renaissance Charter School, based in West Palm Beach, FL, is an example of an education provider ... [+] that has responded to the growing demand for education regardless of the classroom setting. CER At the Forbes Under 30 Summit in Detroit, Forbes announced from the stage the STOP Award , a new $1 million prize open to education innovators, providers and entrepreneurs who continued to support underserved families during COVID-19 and who seek to expand their work in the coming year. Administered by the Center for Education Reform and supported by my philanthropy, the STOP Award is a $1 million prize to an individual or group who are providing an education experience that is Sustainable, Transformational, Outstanding and Permission-less. There are varying definitions of what it means for education to be transformed. The best education providers - schools, technologists, or even non-traditional groups - believe that new approaches, technologies and ways of learning that bring education into the 21st century are a critical link to taking students from bottom quartiles in almost every subject to where they are thriving. Take G-Star School of the Arts , for example. The entire school is different from any traditional model. Along with a traditional curriculum, G-Star exposes students to all of the arts and let\u2019s them decide the path they want to pursue. Located in what once was and continues to be one of the largest movie studios in the country, multi-million dollar productions take place while students learn on the set the variety of skills, occupations and learning needed to pursue a career in related fields. Students can change their focus and their programs until they find their passion. Along with Advanced Place courses, the International Baccalaureate, digital animation, coding or set building, there are high expectations for students to learn core academics while giving them breadth to spend their time collaborating on passion projects. When I visited, I listened to a young lady recite a dramatic scene in her acting class. Being taught by industry veterans that transform these young minds, these dedicated educators take it one step further by giving them access to the very entertainment sector in which they want to succeed and develop their craft. What was once \u201cjust\u201d a movie studio is now a school. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event Another key to great education is that it is permission-less for the provider and for the family. Most adults in this nation grew up attending public schools that were created for us by well-intentioned, and once incredibly professional organizations. But if you wanted to do anything differently, you had to ask permission. Parents had to ask permission to attend another public school, or failing that opportunity, leave to find another, costly alternative if that school didn\u2019t work for their student. Teachers who wanted to find or develop novel approaches to learning would have to ask permission to do things differently, and most attest to the fact that they were usually told \u201cno.\u201d For programs to work for students, there should not be a need for anyone to ask permission to create, attend or leave a particular educational environment. Of course, there are basic standards of health, safety and civil rights that must be adhered to to protect our kids, but thankfully our nation is full of laws that tell all enterprises what they can and legally cannot do. During Covid, we saw quickly that enterprising educators, parents, and students were able to find ways to get education working again. Even then, many communities and states denied them the opportunity to keep at what they were doing, or to even expand. Students from SLAM Academy, based in Miami, FL. CER In Los Angeles, the school district shut down for six weeks while it evaluated next steps, and never physically opened back up. Its remote education was widely criticized for failing to adapt to the needs of most students. But in Miami, Florida, SLAM Academy was able to pivot quickly with technology and keep going. They taught kids at the same time in different places; their teachers were allowed, and in fact encouraged, to carry out classes synchronously online, or to help students whenever and wherever needed. But traditional educators were forbidden, by union contracts, from delivering synchronous education online for more than 1.5 hours a day. Innovative and performing schools should be able to operate beyond philanthropy by utilizing state education funds allocated for students that will enable students to have the learning environment that best meets their needs. It's illogical that so many great programs and ideas need to be sustained by philanthropic support from tens of billions of dollars each year when these are public services. The United States spends $752.3 billion on public education annually; this past 18 months another $190 billion was allocated from the federal government, with the intention of helping schools and students adversely affected by Covid to improve the education process. That amounts to $6,000 more on top of the average of $12,600 per student nationally already spent. And yet, districts are using Education Stabilization Funds to renovate, upgrade astro-turf and create new football stadiums, rather than on creating transformational education. Renaissance Charter School, West Palm Beach, Fl. CER It doesn\u2019t take fancy facilities or new stadiums to educate. Look at Renaissance Charter School , who are operating out of what was an old furniture store just along Route 1 in West Palm Beach, Florida, and now it\u2019s a school. Their educational program, which opened in August of 2012, is educating 1,500 students who receive personalized learning plans, and encourages substantial parental involvement, which they get, despite being in one of the least advantaged communities in the county. The school has all of the standard features to enable their K-8 students to be carefully nurtured, infused with a mix of technology, hands-on learning and flexibility for educators to get the job done. \u2018Permission-less\u2019 education puts the people professionally leading education in charge, gives parents latitude to direct the education of their kids, and puts regulatory practices in their place, as guardians of safety and accountability not daily oversight and micromanagement. The Florida charter schools highlighted here have the benefit of being in a state where most families have access to permission-less education. But the process in most states is akin to winning a lottery to get a good education. It wouldn\u2019t have to be that way if parents were able to direct state tax dollars that are channeled into education budgets to a school of their choice. Poor families should not have to be beholden to charity. The education money is theirs and they should be permitted to spend it the best way they can for their children. This is the educational freedom wealthier families enjoy and poor and middle class families deserve. We need to \u201cSTOP\u201d the current approach to funding education and give students an outstanding education, regardless of who is providing education. When they have the funds and the freedom to find, create and choose transformative programs that meet the needs of their individual children, parents and educators will do just that.",

    "full_description": "A seller wants $24,545,011.20 for the California license plate \"MM.\" And yes, you read that incredibly large number right. To be extra trendy, the sale is tied to a non-fungible token (NFT). In California, two-character license plates have the fewest emblems in ones available to the public. Plus, the limited number of alphanumeric combinations makes them very rare. The website advertising the sale is pushing the $24.5 million 'MM' plate as \"The Ultimate Flex.\" While this argument is true in a certain way, a person can take things too far. Even in California, that amount of money is enough to buy a very nice house or pack a garage full of fun vehicles. The seller believes this massive investment is for \"the type of person who sees the value in the exclusive, rare, & one-of-a-kind.\" Maybe there is an ultra-wealthy car enthusiast out there that sees value in owning the \"MM\" plate. License Plate News: The way that this sale works is that the buyer is technically purchasing the NFT that has a price of 5,888 units in the cryptocurrency ethereum . The price in dollars is so odd because of the conversion rate. In California, it's possible for people to transfer vanity license plates. This makes it possible for the current owner to sign over the \"MM\" plate to the buyer. The same seller also has the 'MM' plate in Texas. It also goes along with an NFT, but this one is a relative bargain at 2,888 ethereum ($12,039,061.20 at current exchange rates). There's certainly precedent for people spending absurd amounts of money on license plates around the world. For example, the \"F1\" number plate in the UK had an asking price equivalent to $20 million in 2018. Also, \"0 10\" in the UK went for $170,000 in 2020 .",

    "full_description": "Being associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump is proving a successful way to be minted as a meme stock. Shares in Creatd Inc. surged as much as 69% after the company announced a new non-fungible token art drop through its OG Gallery unit consisting of three photographs of Trump. The NFT includes \u201cthree candid images of a young Donald Trump, captured as he signs the breast of a model,\u201d Creatd said. Trading volume was more than 500% of the three-month average on Monday. The stock, which triggered at least one trading halt shortly after the market open in New York, and the NFT are being discussed on Reddit and StockTwits. This followed news on Friday that Creatd\u2019s WHE Agency has signed TikTok creator Alexis LaRue. The shares closed 41% higher that day. Meme World Creatd becomes part of a growing number of retail-trader favorites linked to Trump. Last week, there was a retail-trading frenzy around Digital World Acquisition Corp., a blank-check company that is set to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group to create a new social media platform called Truth Social. Digital World shares jumped more than 800% in the two sessions following the announcement. A second blank-check company, Benessere Capital Acquisition, jumped as much as 58% on Monday. Both companies are run by Patrick Orlando, a former Deutsche Bank AG derivatives trader who co-founded a sugar-trading company before more recently embracing SPACs. Then there is Phunware Inc. a software company that worked on Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. Its shares rose 471% on Friday and extended gains on Monday.",

    "full_description": "As the dominant seagrass species on the U.S. West Coast, eelgrass supports a wide range of ecosystem services and functions, making its preservation and restoration a top priority for the region. Eelgrass restoration has a spotty record of success, however, and studies of restoration sites have rarely assessed the full range of ecosystem functions. In a new study published October 6 in Ecological Applications , researchers demonstrated that eelgrass restoration efforts can lead to rapid expansion of restored plots and recovery of ecosystem functions. The study involved small-scale experimental seagrass restoration efforts in Elkhorn Slough on the Central Coast of California. Researchers transplanted 2,340 shoots of eelgrass from healthy meadows into 117 small plots, and evaluated their success relative to areas without vegetation and natural eelgrass meadows. \"Within a few years, most of the ecosystem functions were near or at the level seen in natural eelgrass meadows, suggesting that these habitats can recover pretty quickly if the conditions are right,\" said first author Kathryn Beheshti, who earned her Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz in 2021 and is currently a California Sea Grant Fellow at the Ocean Protection Council's Climate Change Program. The restored plots expanded dramatically, resulting in eelgrass beds covering an area 85 times larger than the initial plots. The restored beds began to resemble the natural meadows in structural features such as canopy height and shoot density, in the richness and abundance of species using the restored habitat, and in water quality. The study assessed a suite of seven ecosystem functions, and the researchers also developed a multifunctionality index to assess the overall functional performance of the restored beds. \"We found that overall the restored plots are performing higher than unvegetated plots and just slightly below the natural meadows,\" Beheshti said. The benefits of eelgrass meadows range from coastal protection and sediment stabilization to providing food and shelter for many species of fish and invertebrates. Eelgrass meadows provide crucial nursery habitat for many commercially important species, such as Dungeness crab, California halibut, and Pacific herring, whose juveniles find protection within the dense canopy. By slowing water flow and attenuating waves, eelgrass can act as a storm buffer and can protect developed coastlines from storm surges. Eelgrass meadows also counteract ocean acidification by absorbing carbon dioxide from seawater. \"Seagrass provides a whole suite of ecosystem services that we rely on, including all the recreational uses by folks like birders, kayakers, fishers, and others,\" Beheshti said. She noted that the California Ocean Protection Council's Strategic Plan to Protect California's Coast and Ocean includes a target to preserve the existing, known 15,000 acres of seagrass beds and create an additional 1,000 acres by 2025. In addition, she said, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service is updating its California Eelgrass Mitigation Policy, which currently calls for \"no net loss of eelgrass habitat function\" but does not require mitigation projects to assess habitat function. \"This study will be a valuable resource for these ongoing efforts,\" Beheshti said. In June, Beheshti and Melissa Ward, an environmental scientist at San Diego State University, published a report on eelgrass restoration for the Pacific Marine and Estuarine Fish Habitat Partnership (\"Eelgrass Restoration on the U.S. West Coast: A Comprehensive Assessment of Restoration Techniques and Their Outcomes\"). In addition, Beheshti, Ward, and Brent Hughes at Sonoma State University, a coauthor of the new paper, are working on a tutorial video about seagrass restoration techniques funded by the Anthropocene Institute. Beheshti said their assessments of past restoration efforts have identified site conditions as the primary driver of success. \"If the site has poor water quality or is prone to erosion or sediment deposition, those are the main predictors of success or failure,\" she said. \"At Elkhorn Slough, the natural eelgrass meadows were also expanding at the same time as our restoration project, so the conditions were primed for success. At this point we can only speculate, but we'd like to explore in a more quantitative way why the restoration was so successful.\" In addition to Beheshti and Hughes, the coauthors of the paper include Susan Williams at UC Davis, Katharyn Boyer at San Francisco State University, Charlie Endris at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, Annakate Clemons at UC Santa Cruz, Tracy Grimes at San Diego State University, and Kerstin Wasson at UCSC and the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve. This work was supported in part by grants from the Ocean Foundation and the Anthropocene Institute. Explore further",

Through the partnership, Mastercard will enable merchants, banks, and fintechs within the US to more easily embrace cryptocurrency and offer it to consumers. What that means in reality is more banks can start offering Mastercard-backed crypto-focused debit and credit cards, as well as the ability to hold digital currency just like they do with the dollar. Loyalty programs will also be offered, allowing consumers to earn cryptocurrency rewards instead of points or cashback, for example. Back in February, Mastercard announced it would allow consumers to pay with cryptocurrency this year . Now the financial services provider is expanding its cryptocurrency options in response to demand. According to the Bakkt U.S. Consumer Crypto Survey , 48% of the 2,000 US respondents purchased cryptocurrency this year and 32% of those who didn't were interested in doing so. Last week, Mastercard announced it had completed its acquisition of CypherTrace , which offers digital security and fraud solutions. The company already worked with a number of the world's largest banks, exchanges, and financial institutions, but can now be integrated into Mastercard's growing number of cryptocurrency services.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Google\u2019s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro reinvent the Pixel line-up. Following a push in the mid-range in previous years, Google has turned up in 2021 to take on the flagships and flagship killers with a stand-out design, the latest Android hardware, and the brand new mobile Tensor chip at the heart of the handset. Stepping aside from some of the biggest numbers in the game of smartphone top trumps, what do the two new handsets offer consumers? Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro Ewan Spence Unlike last year\u2019s Pixel 5 family, both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro feel premium thanks to the materials used. You have the curved screen protected by Gorilla Glass Victus, with Victus also used for the two tone glossy back on the Pixel 6 Pro. It\u2019s built around metal frame, the weight distribution is good, and the whole construction feels symmetrical and comfortable. The first moments with the device just feel right. That\u2019s going to be vital when it goes on sale and consumers are picking up and trying out handsets on display in retail stores. Then there\u2019s the camera bar. For consumers, this is far more important than the Tensor chip, voice typing, the various software layers in the camera, or the phone-wide searching, and I think this is going to be the most important decision the Pixel team have made. The camera bar will be anchor in the public\u2019s mind. For all the talk of the iPhone\u2019s notch, it creates an impressive silhouette and design cue for Apple\u2019s smartphone. Putting aside iOS for the moment, the public know the iPhone because they can see the notch. OnePlus has it\u2019s three way alert slider as the feature that sticks in the mind. HMD Global\u2019s Nokia handsets have the circular camera island, Samsung has the S-Pen. Each manufacturer has something physical to stand out in the increasingly commoditised world of \u2018all glass super thin smartphones'. Now Google\u2019s Pixel family has a distinctive and practical mark of its own with the camera bar. No other phone has this look and you can easily ask for \u201cthe one with the stripe at the back\u201d. It\u2019s practical because, until islands of camera the phone does not not rock around it when on a table, and it offers a nice ledge at the back of the large phone to help hold it in place in your hand. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event It also makes it easier to bring the power of the camera hardware and software into the discussion. Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro Ewan Spence No doubt the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro is going to face a raft of camera tests, shoot-outs, pixel-by-pixel comparisons, and detailed measurements online. Quantifying which smartphone edges out the competition in the very top sliver of the top of a very big market is to Google and the whole ecosystem. The prowess and power of a camera is a proxy for the entire smartphone race, it\u2019s a tangible representation of many of the key specifications from the camera itself to the software used to take the pictures and process the images. The Pixel 6 Pro comes with three rear cameras, the 50 megapixel main wide camera, the 48 megapixel x4 telephoto, and the 12 megapixel ultrawide may not reach the larger numbers seen in the likes of Xiaomi and Huawei, but the pictures they produce look impressive and reproduce the colors without over saturation or excessive sharpening. The Pixel 6 is a dual-lens affair at the rear, with the same 50 megapixel main camera and 12 megapixel ultrawide, dropping the telephoto lens. Some of the key features that will make the Pixel cameras attractive are available through editing on the handset. One that contributes the most to this real-life reflection in the images is Real Tone, and it\u2019s part of the core image processing (so you can\u2019t switch it off, but Im not sure why you would want to). In short this has expanded the Pixel camera\u2019s ability to reproduce a wider range of skin tones. I doubt that the most owners of the new Pixels will call out Real Tone when showing off their pictures, but they will notice the difference and put it down to \u2018this phone takes good pictures.\" And when there are options and choices to make in editing the images, the Tensor chip with its machine learning and on device processing all contribute to the results. The Magic Eraser is going to be talked about a lot; essentially a \u2018stray object removal tool\u2019 it offers a level of editing that even a few years ago needed some careful skill with editing software. Now, when you open the Magic Eraser editing tool stray elements will be picked out and you can tap on them to be removed from the picture If there are other elements you\u2019d like removed (such as a stray cloud) then circling the element will see it removed. Pixel 6 Pro's magic eraser takes on a pigeon and a cloud in Edinburgh. Ewan Spence Is it perfect? Of course not, this is an artistic tool that has to make subjective choices in the background. The larger the element you want to take out, the harder it is going to be to smooth out affected air. For example, if you\u2019ve taken a picture with a stray pigeon in shot, then away it goes, but the shadow will not be as easy to remove. Professionals will still use their more advanced tools, but for the vast majority of family snaps and memories that smartphones are used for, Magic Eraser will be something prized and could be the feature that swings a purchasing decision. Face Unblur has the same impact, offering a tool which will help polish of, well, a fact that has been blurred due to movement or camera shake. It\u2019s a limited use case (Google points out that it\u2019s not suitable for pets for example) but it\u2019s another simple to explain feature that requires all of the processing power on-device from both the Tensor chip and the software. Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro Ewan Spence Then you have other quality of life features that harness that machine learning. you have increased accuracy with Assistant voice typing; more accuracy with the live translation features both for text messages and alerts, but also automatic subtitling of foreign language videos. These are part of Android as a whole, but Google has optimised the Pixel package to make these as accurate as possible. The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are two of the first smartphones that will be released with Android 12. One of the big changes in this new version of the mobile operating system is the introduction of Material You, the new user interface from Google. This brings with it a lot of curves and rounded edges, larger icons, and greater readability. That\u2019s balanced with pushing less information on a screen and hiding away more of the complexity behind toggle able options deep in the settings - an approach that feels rather familiar when you look at the competition. Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro Ewan Spence That will give the Pixels a small window where the software choices will show a marked difference to the other Android handsets on sale. It\u2019s not a huge difference, but the Pixel 6 Pro feels a lot less threatening to new users, even though it is still the same Android underneath and the vast majority of third-party applications are not get following the rote of the low information density offered by Android 12. While you can play around with font and display sizes in the settings, you can\u2019t escape the huge quick settings tiles, the extra padding on notification alert strips, and the huge app icons. While these changes will filter through to the rest of the Android ecosystem in the near future, the premium handsets from the likes of Samsung may not take the exact same approach. Right now the software feels different, and contributes to a feeling of freshness on the device\u2026 even though it\u2019s not to my personal tastes. I\u2019ll also note that Google is offering five years of security updates to the handset, which should reassure consumers of the longevity of the device, even though core Android updates are limited to three years. Given Android is seen as Google\u2019s own operating system, and with its own chip design it has far more control over the hardware, this is a curious choice. Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro Ewan Spence The Pixel 6 family feels very much like a page break for the Pixel line. There\u2019s a clear delineation between what has come before, and what is coming up. There\u2019s an argument that Google could have moved away from the \u2018Pixel\u2019 name, just as it broke away from \u2018Nexus\u2019 to change the attitudes around its smartphone. Yet Pixel does have traction in the market and if other manufactures can have hard breaks in product lines while keeping the brand intact, why not Google. They are packed with technology, big numbers, new concepts, and smart programming. All of that would add up to naught if the implementation was poor. That\u2019s not the case. From the original and distinctive design, through the camera that mixes new processing techniques and easily used editing features, to the new approach to the UI and a more welcoming environment, the Pixel 6 Pro feels like the first Pixel handset in some time that can stand up to the mighty iPhone and the high-flying premium Android smartphones from its partners. The Pixel 6 is aggressively priced to take on the \u2018flagship killers\u2019 in the mid range market and to act as the de factor challenger to the iPhone 13. While there are questions about how much market share the Pixel range can gain, Google has addressed concerns about marketability and created a flagship smartphone for consumers. It has signalled to its partners the direct that Android is going and laid down a marker on what is possible. And by packing in new hardware and software, the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro should be seen as the bleeding edge of mobile computing.

Ideal for quick 10-minute blasts and hour-long sessions alike, you can take on increasingly difficult CPU opponents or attempt to ascend the rankings in online multiplayer.</p><p>There's two gameplay modes: Arcade and Simulation. Arcade is faster-paced while making it easier to execute power shots with less accuracy, whereas Simulation demands a deft hand if you want to avoid the ball careering past the edge of the table.</p><p>Despite its online mode suffering from a point-scoring glitch, Racket Fury is one of the few sports games on the Quest where we never fail to find active players (at least in the Europe lobby, anyway).

The ability to teleport behind rogue bots, grab them by the chin and spin round to launch them into oncoming enemies is something that wasn't easy on the Rift without risking serious ankle injury.</p><p>Added to Unplugged's consistent frame-rate, all of the above makes going for a high-score all the more enjoyable.

    "full_description": "Over the past few years, virtual reality has taken a huge leap forward thanks to the hugely popular Oculus Quest 2 and its predecessor the Oculus Quest . Both of these VR headsets are completely standalone, meaning you can take them anywhere you want without having to worry about bulky computers or wires so you can enjoy Oculus Quest games (almost) anywhere you might want to. The Facebook-owned Oculus Quest headsets are basically wireless VR consoles, and they come with their own storefront for you to buy and play games. With the additional purchase of an Oculus Link cable or by using Air Link over Wi-Fi, you can also hook your headset up to your PC and play VR games that are outside of the Quest\u2019s usual library. Though the first Oculus Quest headset is no longer available to buy, being totally eclipsed by the Quest 2, it'll still run most games that are being produced with the Oculus Quest 2 in mind for the time being \u2013 even if performance doesn't quite match up to that of the newer headset. However, some games are starting to be made exclusively for the new headset \u2013 such as Resident Evil 4 VR. Even so, there is still a mountain of games for you to sift through on both the original Oculus Quest and the Oculus Quest 2, so we\u2019re here to lend a hand. We\u2019ve picked out our absolute favorite games you can play on the Oculus Quest \u2013 either natively or with PC support \u2013 so that you can enjoy the best that virtual reality has to offer. First Steps is a free game on the Oculus Quest 2 that serves as a demo for what is possible in the virtual reality spaces you\u2019ll be playing in. Just because it plays as a sort of tutorial doesn\u2019t mean you should dismiss it outright though, as its minigames are the perfect way to get comfortable in VR and are really fun to boot. Beat Saber has sold more than a million units across existing VR platforms for good reason \u2013 it's addictive as heck \u2013 and simple enough for anyone to jump into. The aim is to slice red and blue blocks in time to music using dual lightsabers while contorting your limbs to duck and dodge advancing walls. At lower difficulties it's fun, but things get really interesting on 'Hard or 'Expert'. Stick with it, and you'll eventually enter a \u2018flow state\u2019 where your arms operate independently of thought. Suddenly you\u2019re slicing through blocks like Luke Skywalker if he'd drummed for Pendulum instead of becoming a Jedi. Make sure you have a big enough play space to execute 360-degree dance moves (which is exclusive to Quest), and hooking up external headphones (especially ones with deep bass) is a must so you can enjoy tracks from Billie Eilish, Imagine Dragons, Linkin Park and LMFAO with the best audio possible. While this game isn\u2019t readily available on the headset\u2019s library, nor the Oculus PC desktop store, you can hook up your Oculus Quest 2 headset to your gaming PC and play Alyx through Steam VR with a special Oculus Link cable. Half-Life: Alyx is generally considered to be one of the best VR games out there and it is easy to see why. If you\u2019ve played the original Half-Life games, you know just how much it relies on gorgeous physics in the gameplay and this is cranked up to the max in Alyx thanks to the extraordinary VR technology it uses. From its outrageously fun mechanics of pulling items towards you with a gravity glove, throwing bottles at hapless guards and the overall exceptional gunplay the game offers, you won\u2019t find a better VR game out there. This game is the perfect James Bond simulator, putting you into the shoes of a bonafide international superspy on a mission to take down a criminal organization no matter what convoluted traps stand in your way. During this escape room-esque experience, you\u2019ll have to outsmart villains as you deflect hidden lasers installed in a private jet, avoid setting off toxic gas in a secret base and repair an elevator so you can reach the criminal mastermind before their plan comes together. Sometimes you\u2019ll be left feeling a little more like Austin powers than 007, but even if you fail over a dozen times this laugh-out-loud VR title won\u2019t ever leave you feeling annoyed. With its charming characters - including the brilliant voice acting of Wil Wheaton - and spy-clich\u00e9 filled story, I Expect You To Die 2 delivers a splendid balance of grand adventure, humor, and puzzles that will leave you feeling like a genius and an idiot in equal measure. Read our full I Expect You To Die 2 review Until a Legend of Zelda game designed from the ground up for VR arrives, Journey of the Gods is the closest thing going. Flaunting an attractive cell-shaded art style that brings its giant and grotesque bosses to life, Gods employs clever use of scale as you traverse its large yet linear levels. While most of the action-adventure game is viewed in the first-person, a \u2018God mode\u2019 lets you manipulate the environment from a strategic top-down perspective to solve puzzles and gain the upper hand in combat. A large play space comes in handy in physically sidestepping projectiles or spinning around to face enemies with your sword and shield when surrounded. The most fun weapon in the game, however, is the crossbow, which is manually reloaded using a crank handle and rewards careful judgement of distance and timing. Many VR experiences are exciting, but there's something extremely special about getting to immerse yourself in a world and a franchise that you've loved for years (decades even). That's why we highly recommend Jurassic Park Aftermath, a story that follows the events of Jurassic World. As you'd expect, this is a survival adventure that requires you to uncover sensitive information while avoiding deadly Velociraptors. You need to solve puzzles, find your way around and do a lot of hiding to get out alive. Lone Echo and its sequel Lone Echo 2 are Oculus Rift games that are specifically designed to be played through your PC via the Oculus Rift headset. But by using the Link cable or Air Link, you can play these phenomenal space explorers on your Quest or Quest 2, too. This is by no means the first VR game to put you in space \u2013 a number of spaceship fighter sims have already attempted it \u2013 but the experience of floating through the environments by pushing yourself, grabbing and climbing, and pulling through zero-G spaces is completely unforgettable and the level of graphical detail is impressive. Sure they can be a little motion sickness-inducing - so we recommend trying out the free-to-play Echo VR game to get a feel for the movement first - but if you\u2019re a VR veteran these games are some of the best that the medium has to offer. Read our Lone Echo 2 review Puzzle-platform fans will feel better about Astro Bot being a PS4 exclusive once they\u2019ve given Moss a go. Developed by former Bungie developers, this cutesy third-person adventure is visually one of the more impressive titles on the Quest, which helps draw you into its immersive 3D environments. You guide Quill, a swashbuckling mouse who\u2019s on a quest to save her uncle after their kingdom was overthrown by a hot-headed snake. Far from a gimmick, Moss employs a clever use of VR that helps you manipulate the environment and guide Quill around levels, tackling environmental puzzles and engaging in combat with enemies along the way. A well-received title on the Oculus Go , arcade-styled ping-pong-a-thon Racket Fury is one of the most moreish titles on the Quest. Ideal for quick 10-minute blasts and hour-long sessions alike, you can take on increasingly difficult CPU opponents or attempt to ascend the rankings in online multiplayer. There's two gameplay modes: Arcade and Simulation. Arcade is faster-paced while making it easier to execute power shots with less accuracy, whereas Simulation demands a deft hand if you want to avoid the ball careering past the edge of the table. Despite its online mode suffering from a point-scoring glitch, Racket Fury is one of the few sports games on the Quest where we never fail to find active players (at least in the Europe lobby, anyway). So we'll continue enjoying it \u2013 at least until Eleven arrives. Pistol Whip is like Beat Saber but with guns instead of lightsabers. As you run through a range of different environments you\u2019ll finally have the chance to become your own action movie star as you dodge bullets and take out enemies, earning bonus points if you can shoot them in time to the backing track. The base game was already fantastic, but free campaign updates have introduced stories and levels set in a cyberpunk future and now also the Wild West. The new content means you\u2019ll have plenty to play, and with challenge modifiers to try out and global leaderboards to compete over you\u2019ll have plenty to do. Pistol Whip is also great if you want to get a little bit more active. Dodging bullets is tiring work and even though it doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of game to make you work up a sweat it definitely will. Resident Evil 4 VR is not only the best horror game you can play on the Oculus Quest 2 headset, but\u2019s one of the best VR games we\u2019ve ever played. Capcom\u2019s classic has been carefully reconstructed for this virtual reality experience, putting you into the body of Leon S. Kennedy for some first-person undead-slaying action. Fans of the original will feel right at home while newcomers to the game will be impressed by the updated graphics and textures that make you forget you\u2019re playing a game that's over a decade old. Capcom and Oculus have also managed to perfectly blend immersion with comfort. The many comfort options let you fine tune the settings to suit your specific needs without taking you out of the experience at all, while the immersive inventory and realistic gunplay will make you feel like a badass as you take on baddies. If you can handle a fright, Resident Evil 4 VR is a must-play game on the Oculus Quest 2 platform. Read our full Resident Evil 4 VR review It's fair to say that few people outside of Drifter, the studio hand-picked by original developer Epic to port Robo Recall to the Quest, expected Unplugged to play nearly identical to the full-fat Oculus Rift version that came out in 2017. While its graphical downgrades are noticeable, the humorous VR wave shooter is arguably even more exhilarating owed to the Quest's 360-degree freedom. The ability to teleport behind rogue bots, grab them by the chin and spin round to launch them into oncoming enemies is something that wasn't easy on the Rift without risking serious ankle injury. Added to Unplugged's consistent frame-rate, all of the above makes going for a high-score all the more enjoyable. Everything from dodging (and deflecting) incoming bullets to using crawlers as makeshift rocket launchers feels like taking part in the Robo-recalling olympics. As one of the droids would say: service with a smile. If you're tired of the high intensity VR games or bright and colourful VR games, then Room VR: A Dark Matter is for you. Released in early 2020 from Fireproof Games , Room VR: A Dark Matter is available on both the Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest 2 headsets \u2013 but many iterations of Room games have been available on other consoles for some time. What Room VR: A Dark Matter brings you is an escape room, mystery and creepy horror story all rolled into one. There are a lot of puzzles involved, which should be just challenging enough for experienced gamers with clues \u2013 you need to activate these, don't worry, they don't just pop-up and spoil it \u2013 for those who need a helping hand. The visuals and imagery of this game are truly spectacular. We don't want to give too much away, as the game is best left shrouded in mystery, but fans of the occult, Ancient Egypt, Lovecraftian horror and early twentieth century detective stories are in for a real treat. It's worth mentioning the transitions of Room VR are really great for those with a sensitivity to motion sickness. There's a gradual fade in and fade out that's more seamless than you'll find on most games. You can choose from sitting and standing options too \u2013 and change these settings each time you play. As well as intuitive controls that you're shown in a way that helps you to pick them up quickly without intruding on the story. If you're a fan of Star Wars, then you'll love this story that sees some of our all-time favorite characters, like R2-D2, C-3PO and even Yoda, join us on a space adventure to the planet Batuu. You take on the role of a droid repair technician aboard a starship. But when pirates attack you hit the escape pods and crash land on Batuu where you'll have to battle enemies and find clues to recover your lost cargo. You can also take part in a couple of Tales - short adventures - from the perspective of other characters in the Star Wars Universe like a Jedi padawan and Bounty Hunter droid. Thanks to the Last Call DLC this game is much more polished, and while we\u2019ve always liked it we\u2019d now say we absolutely adore it. The DLC expands on all of the game\u2019s stories making it feel like a much more complete package and doesn\u2019t add much to the game\u2019s overall price. Read our take on Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy\u2019s Edge Superhot has come a long way since its humble beginnings as a browser-based tech demo in 2013. The first-person shooter has found a natural home on the Quest, where it makes the most of 360-degree tracking by having enemies flank you from all sides. Because time moves in slow-motion when you do, Superhot VR benefits from the flexibility of a bigger playspace. As the difficulty ramps up, you'll need every inch of cover to dodge incoming fire, bullet-time style, while shattering faceless enemies using guns, shurikens, and - most satisfyingly - your clenched fists. The Star Wars game that finally gives you your own real lightsaber\u2026 at least, in VR. Vader Immortal follows a short, episodic, three-part narrative which is nothing to write home about. But the gameplay, which lets you blast things with the force, push Vader\u2019s buttons (literally and virtually) and swing around a lightsaber, lends to an extremely worthwhile and enjoyable experience. Obviously, motion sickness is a big issue with a lot of VR games but this is mostly with games which make you move around with an analogue stick. Vader Immortal, on the other hand, lets you move by selecting a destination to go to and teleporting there, with an extremely short fade-to-black to illustrate the travelling. This keeps motion sickness kept to the bare minimum. Vader Immortal does an incredible job at immersing you in the world of Star Wars, which, let\u2019s be honest, is probably something a lot of people wish for.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin There are at least three major potential definitions of the metaverse, this hot trendy thing that Facebook is investing $5 billion into and hiring 10,000 technologists for. First is Ready Player One : fully immersive digital life. Second is Free Guy from the perspective of Ryan Reynold\u2019s character: a continuum from default reality to augmented reality to full immersion. Third is just ... the internet: from its text-based origins decades ago to complete virtual reality. So which is it? I recently spent some time with Avi Bar-Zeev on that very question. You don\u2019t know his name, but he\u2019s been working on metaverse technology for 30 years: building the tools to tell the stories he\u2019s wanted to share for decades. Bar-Zeev built Keyhole, then sold it to Google as Google Earth. He helped Microsoft build its mixed reality headset Hololens, worked with virtual worlds pioneer Second Life to help define its technology, built an AR cloud prototype for Bing, and VR experiences for Disney. And he\u2019s consulted with Apple on products he won\u2019t talk about, but can only be Apple\u2019s coming metaverse product: VR goggles, smartglasses, or something similar but dramatically new. One thing is clear: he hates people using Neal Stephenson\u2019s Snow Crash as an example of something they want to build. Avi Bar-Zeev Avi Bar-Zeev MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event \u201cEvery article always mentions Neal Stephenson\u2019s Snow Crash,\u201d Bar-Zeev told me in a recent episode of the TechFirst podcast . \u201cAnd that one I would describe as a place to escape dystopian reality, to go become someone else anonymous. In fact, you using your real name would actually probably get you killed.\u201d In other words: Snow Crash is not a utopia to create, but rather a nightmare to avoid. If Bar-Zeev lands anywhere on the question of what this nebulous thing we\u2019re investing billions into actually is, he lands on \u201cfuture internet.\u201d But he\u2019s not crazy about the term metaverse anymore. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole other definition, which is the really broad one, which is it\u2019s just the future internet,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd I would argue that maybe we don\u2019t even want to call that the \u2018metaverse\u2019 anymore because there\u2019s so much baggage with the other ones, that maybe we want to come up with a new name for this, because it is new and it\u2019s more like what evolves naturally anyway ... ten years from now, it\u2019s something that\u2019ll just be, it\u2019ll just exist around us.\u201d Bingo. That\u2019s why companies like Facebook are investing billions of dollars. That\u2019s why Apple is working so hard in secrecy to come up with the next major computing platform, the smartglasses that will (perhaps) take the place of the smartphone as the computer continues its evolution from something in a room to something on a desk to something in our hand to something on our body to \u2014 perhaps a decade or two past smartglasses \u2014 something that is part of our body. Three things are key to Bar-Zeev as we continue this chaotic evolution towards the next big thing. Listen to our conversation: One is privacy. We built the internet on the back of advertising. Advertising is more valuable when accurately targeted. Accurate targeting requires data, and digital consumer data as we have largely built it to date is privacy invasive. Given that a metaverse internet existing in more immersive forms than what we ordinarily experience today would mix digital and physical realities, shaping not just the facts we see but the world we see, reality bubbles become a bigger problem. And so does privacy, as we increasingly live in digital spaces. \u201cI really hope that whatever we do, we figure out monetization models that don\u2019t rely on advertising,\u201d says Bar-Zeev. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll have the right infrastructure and systems in place for the best outcomes to happen and not the worst. And the worst could be pretty bad. The worst could be basically virtual enslavement, where our devices are controlling what we see and implicitly controlling what we do, and we lose our freedom of thought. We lose our freedom to have our political views and whatever spectrums we want them to be. And so there\u2019s a real danger there. And because this technology is so much more powerful than television or the internet has been, I\u2019d say it\u2019s another 10X more powerful.\u201d Another is parsimony. When we think of digital immersion, we often thing of busy, noisy, in-your-face augments, with streams of data and metadata filling our augmented reality views. (Not to mention ads.) As Ready Player One IOI CEO and big time bad guy Nolan Sorrento says in the movie, \u201cwe estimate we can sell up to 80% of an individual\u2019s visual field before inducing seizures.\u201d Not cool, says Bar-Zeev. \u201cMostly you want AR to be fairly minimalistic. You want to introduce one or two new elements into the world, and hopefully these are things that enhance your experience. You know, augmented reality is really about augmenting people, augmenting your perception of the world. So if you give us too much stuff, we\u2019re going to be confused and we\u2019re going to be pulled out of reality. That can manifest in simple ways during our Zoomed-out work-from-home lifestyles. Watching someone\u2019s face while videoconferencing means they\u2019re seeing you look below their visual field, and the inverse is true for them. Performing some industrial light and magic with technology could make us both feel like we\u2019re looking each other in the eyes ... and maybe give us a meeting setting in Himalayas, or on the African savannah, rather than in my suburban basement and your downtown shoebox condo. The third is interoperability. The internet worked (and works!) because it is open. Decentralized by design, and engineered with standards of interoperability so that millions of servers and devices can both run the infrastructure and access the wealth of experiences living on it. That doesn\u2019t mean everything works everywhere, but it does mean standard modes of engagement. \u201cI do think that interoperability is the key idea that the internet exists in thousands, millions \u2014 hundreds of millions maybe \u2014 servers, because we have some standards of interoperability that were established early on by people who were very forward-thinking in terms of how do we share bits of information,\u201d Bar-Zeev says. \u201cHow do we share packets? How do we ask for things? And how do we put content out there? And that was a necessary component to be able to build what we call the web. And I think we do need the same thing. It\u2019s not strictly required that every website or every 3D world interoperate with every other one, we don\u2019t have to mash them up. But it is important that we can share some things between them, that there are ways of fetching content that are fairly standard.\u201d And 3D immersion? Is that critical to the concept of metaverse? In other words, do we need Ready Player One or Snow Crash before we can point to it and say: the metaverse exists, this is what it is, we have created it? Not for Bar-Zeev. Because the metaverse is more than three dimensional. It\u2019s multi-dimensional and we simply can\u2019t express that visually in three dimensions in a way that makes sense. \u201cWe had GeoCities early on with the web,\u201d Bar-Zeev says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make a ton of sense to try to put a 2D metaphor on the web, and I think making a 3D metaphor for the entire [metaverse] also \u2014 it\u2019s way more than three-dimensional, that\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s very large dimensional and so links make sense.\u201d What does make sense is searching. Linking. Some three-dimensional spaces for social, entertainment, and certain types of work. But plenty of places that look pretty much like your flat computer screen right now. And others that have no physical dimensions. When you ask Alexa to turn on the lights, you\u2019re accessing the metaverse: a physical node close to you with sensors and radios, cloud systems with graph networks of intelligence, physical networks connecting that intelligence to other smart devices in your home, and connections to the \u201creal\u201d world to make things actually happen with switches and electrons and photons. While we might use similar devices for both AR and VR, Bar-Zeev makes a distinct separation between the two. In this view, augmented reality is full-time, always accessible. (We already have that today. Remember pre-Google and pre-smartphone days? Remember how \u201cignorant\u201d we were? If we didn\u2019t know something and weren\u2019t in a place we could \u201clook it up,\u201d we would just have to chalk it up as something we couldn\u2019t answer. Now, of course, most knowledge is a few Google searches away, and this is augmented reality. Not in the visual sense, of course, but augmented nevertheless.) \u201cAR is going to be all the time,\u201d Bar-Zeev says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be 18 hours a day of wearing some convenient AR device, whether it\u2019s glasses or maybe at some point in the future it\u2019s contact lenses ... it\u2019s our interface to future computers. It\u2019s our interface to future internet. It\u2019s our interface to IoT. It\u2019s our way of connecting with people in holographic telepresence.\u201d But VR? Full immersion? That\u2019s less appealing as a 24/7 reality for Bar-Zeev, because that absents us from the physical reality around us. It\u2019s invasive and demands all our attention: something that we\u2019ll want perhaps only 1% or maybe 10% of the time, he argues. What is all this technology going to be for? For Bar-Zeev, a very human purpose: telling better stories. \u201cThe first true AR demo was in 1968, which was the year I was born,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe reason I got into this in the first place is I wanted to do fun stuff. I wanted to make movies and tell stories, and the tools were so bad that I\u2019m like, okay, I gotta go start building the tools. And the hardware\u2019s so bad, okay, I gotta go start building the hardware.\u201d \u201cAnd hopefully at some point I get to actually go start telling stories again.\u201d Subscribe to TechFirst , or get a full transcript .",

Advertisement According to the Associated Press , Ladapo arrived maskless at Polsky's office Wednesday with two maskless aides. Polsky's staff offered them masks, but they refused to wear them. At the time, Polsky had not yet made her cancer diagnosis public, but staff told Ladapo that Polksy had a serious medical condition that necessitated taking health precautions. Polsky asked Ladapo why he refused to wear a mask, but according to Polsky, he refused to answer the question. \u201cIt was so shocking to me that he treated me in this manner,\u201d Polsky told the AP. \u201cIf he is a surgeon general for the next several years, I am really concerned about a future public health emergency and not being able to rely on him for necessary guidance and proper scientific leadership.\u201d Republican Florida Senate leader Wilton Simpson on Saturday sent a memo to senators about the incident and requested that visitors be respectful. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take a cancer diagnosis for people to respect each other\u2019s level of comfort with social interactions during a pandemic,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cWhat occurred in Senator Polsky\u2019s office was unprofessional and will not be tolerated in the Senate.\u201d A spokesperson for Florida's Department of Health, Weesam Khoury, confirmed the scheduled meeting between Ladapo and Polsky but told the AP that the department would address meeting accommodations between health officials and senate members privately.",

    "full_description": "Researchers from North Carolina State University have developed a new process that makes use of existing industry standard techniques for making III-nitride semiconductor materials, but results in layered materials that will make LEDs and lasers more efficient. III- nitride semiconductor materials are wide-bandgap semiconductors that are of particular interest in optic and photonic applications because they can be used to create lasers and LEDs that produce light in the visible bandwidth range. And when it comes to large-scale manufacturing, III-nitride semiconductor materials produced using a technique called metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Semiconductor devices require two materials, a \"p-type\" and an \" n-type .\" Electrons move from the n-type material to the p-type material. This is made possible by creating a p-type material that has \"holes,\" or spaces that electrons can move into. A challenge for people who make LEDs and lasers has been that there was a limit on the number of holes that you can make in p-type III-nitride semiconductor materials that are created using MOCVD. But that limit just went up. \"We have developed a process that produces the highest concentration of holes in p-type material in any III-Nitride semiconductor made using MOCVD,\" says Salah Bedair, co-author of a paper on the work and a distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering at NC State. \"And this is high quality material \u2013 very few defects \u2013 making it suitable for use in a variety of devices.\" In practical terms, this means more of the energy input in LEDs is converted into light. For lasers, it means that less of the energy input will be wasted as heat by reducing the metal contact resistance. LEDs contain three main layers: an n-type layer where electrons originate; the so-called \"active region,\" which consists of multiple quantum wells of indium gallium nitride and gallium nitride; and a p-type layer, where the holes originate. To produce semiconductor materials for use in LEDs or laser diodes , the researchers use a growth technique called \"semibulk growth\" to produce indium gallium nitride templates. The template is made of dozens of layers of indium gallium nitride and gallium nitride. The researchers use these templates for the n-type region to reduce complications that arise with the growth of the quantum wells. The insertion of the gallium nitride layer in between the indium gallium nitride layers in semibulk reduces defects due to the lattice mismatch between the semibulk template and the gallium nitride substrate, as well as filling the pits that form on the surface. In their new work, the researchers demonstrated that the semibulk growth approach can be used for the p-type layer in LEDs to increase the number of holes. This new approach is cost effective from a manufacturing standpoint, since III-nitride based LED devices can be done in one growth via MOCVD, without a lengthy processing time in between. Using this technique, the researchers were able to achieve a hole density of 5 \u00d7 10 19 cm -3 in the p-type material. Previously, the highest hole concentration achieved in p-type III-nitride materials using MOCVD was about an order of magnitude lower. The researchers also applied these indium gallium nitride templates as substrates for LED structures to address the long-lasting problem called the \"green gap,\" where the LED output deteriorates when emitting in the green and yellow part of the spectrum. One of the main reasons for the green gap is the large lattice mismatch between the light emitting part of the material, the quantum well, when gallium nitride substrates are used. The researchers have demonstrated that replacing the gallium nitride substrates with indium gallium nitride templates results in improved LED performances. The researchers compared the LED emission spectrum for the same quantum well emitting in blue when grown on gallium nitride substrate and emitting either in green or yellow when grown on different indium gallium nitride templates. A 100 nm shift in the emission wavelength was achieved due to the application of the indium gallium nitride templates. The paper on improved efficiency, \"P-type In x Ga 1-x N semibulk templates (0.02 < x < 0.16) with room temperature hole concentration of mid-10 19 cm -3 and device quality surface morphology,\" is published in the journal Applied Physics Letters .

    "full_description": "Mangrove trees straddle the boundary between land and ocean, in harsh environments characterized by rapidly changing levels of salinity and low oxygen. For most plants, these conditions would mark a death sentence, but mangroves have evolved a remarkable resistance to the stresses of these hostile locations. Now, researchers from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) have decoded the genome of the mangrove tree, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, and revealed how this species regulates its genes in order to cope with stress. Their findings, published recently in New Phytologist , could one day be used to help other plants be more tolerant to stress. \"Mangroves are an ideal model system for studying the molecular mechanism behind stress tolerance, as they naturally cope with various stress factors,\" said Dr. Matin Miryeganeh, first author of the study and a researcher in the Plant Epigenetics Unit at OIST. Mangroves are an important ecosystem for the planet, protecting coastlines from erosion, filtering out pollutants from water and serving as a nursery for fish and other species that support coastal livelihoods. They also play a crucial role in combating global warming , storing up to four times as much carbon in a given area as a rainforest. Despite their importance, mangroves are being deforested at an unprecedented rate, and due to human pressure and rising seas, are forecast to disappear in as little as 100 years. And genomic resources that could help scientists try to conserve these ecosystems have so far been limited. The mangrove project, which was initially suggested by Sydney Brenner, one of the founding fathers of OIST, began in 2016, with a survey of mangrove trees in Okinawa. The scientists noticed that the mangrove tree, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, showed striking differences between individuals rooted in the oceanside, with high salinity, and those in the upper riverside, where the waters were more brackish. \"The trees were amazingly different; near the ocean, the height of the trees was about one to two meters, whereas further up the river, the trees grew as high as seven meters,\" said senior author, Professor Hidetoshi Saze, who leads the Plant Epigenetics Unit. \"But the shorter trees were not unhealthy \u2013 they flowered and fruited normally \u2013 so we think this modification is adaptive, perhaps allowing the salt-stressed plant to invest more resources into coping with its harsh environment.\" Unlike long-term evolutionary adaptation, which involves changes to the genetic sequence, adaptations to the environment that take place over an organism's lifespan occur via epigenetic changes. These are chemical modifications to DNA that affect the activity of different genes, adjusting how the genome responds to different environmental stimuli and stresses. Organisms like plants, which can't move to a more comfortable environment, rely heavily on epigenetic changes to survive. Before focusing in on how the genome was regulated, the research team first extracted DNA from the mangrove tree, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, and decoded the genome for this species. They found that the genome contained 309 million base pairs, with a predicted 34,403 genes \u2013 a much larger genome than those for other known mangrove tree species. The large size was due to, for the most part, almost half of the DNA being made up of repeating sequences. When the research team examined the type of repetitive DNA, they found that over a quarter of the genome consisted of genetic elements called transposons, or 'jumping genes.' Prof. Saze explained: \"Active transposons are parasitic genes that can 'jump' position within the genome, like cut-and paste or copy-and-paste computer functions. As more copies of themselves are inserted into the genome, repetitive DNA can build up.\" Transposons are a big driver of genome evolution, introducing genetic diversity, but they are a double-edged sword. Disruptions to the genome through the movement of transposons are more likely to cause harm than provide a benefit, particularly when a plant is already stressed, so mangrove trees generally have smaller genomes than other plants, with suppressed transposons. However, this isn't the case for Bruguiera gymnorhiza, with the scientists speculating that as this mangrove species is more ancestral than others, it may not have evolved to have an efficient means of suppression. The team then examined how activity of the genes, including the transposons, varied between individuals in the oceanside location with high salinity, and individuals in the less saline, brackish waters upriver. They also compared gene activity for mangrove trees grown in the lab, under two different conditions that replicated the oceanside and upriver salinity levels. Overall, in both the oceanside individuals and those grown in high salinity conditions in the lab, genes involved in suppressing transposon activity showed higher expression, while genes that normally promote transposon activity showed lower expression. In addition, when the team looked specifically into transposons, they found evidence of chemical modifications on their DNA that lowered their activity. \"This shows that an important means of coping with saline stress involves silencing transposons,\" said Dr. Miryeganeh. The researchers also saw increases in the activity of genes involved in stress responses in plants, including those that activate when plants are water-deprived. Gene activity also suggested the stressed plants have lower levels of photosynthesis. In future research, the team plan to study how seasons, changes in temperature and rainfall, also affect the activity of the mangrove tree genomes. \"This study acts as a foundation, providing new insights into how mangrove trees regulate their genome in response to extreme stresses,\" said Prof. Saze. \"More research is needed to understand how these changes in gene activity impact molecular processes within the plant cells and tissues and could one day help scientists create new plant strains that can better cope with stress.\" Explore further",

With nearly 47,000 employees and reported revenues of \u20ac8.567 billion at the end of its 2020 Fiscal Year, the company develops and delivers semiconductor solutions that are laser-focused on making life easier, safer and greener. With the world\u2019s increasing population placing unprecedented demands on energy, Infineon brings \u201cingredient\u201d capabilities to market that address the complexities and diverse challenges that modern lifestyles tend to personify. In 2020, Infineon Technologies became a global top semiconductor entity with its acquisition of Cypress Semiconductor Corporation . This acquisition created compelling synergies for Infineon as it broadened its technology portfolio to a new set of customers and enabled Infineon to offer comprehensive system solutions for the automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) markets. Of course, the Cypress acquisition creates scale and innovation benefits by leveraging the combined companies\u2019 IP and know-how. This positions Infineon as one of the world\u2019s few semiconductor companies that genuinely operate as a \u201clink\u201d between the real and digital worlds. Winning companies in this space have \u201cfull-stack\u201d solutions that span the chipset and software spectrum to enable today\u2019s modern, connected products. The growing importance of IoT solutions There is no better example of Infineon\u2019s overall strategy than its go-to-market approach in the burgeoning IoT market. In an extensive interview with Vikram Gupta, Senior Vice President of Infineon\u2019s IoT, Compute and Wireless group, he laid out the critical elements of Infineon\u2019s strategy, value proposition and mission. There\u2019s ample reason for Infineon\u2019s focus on the global IoT market: it\u2019s forecasted to reach $1.386 trillion in 2026 from $761.4 billion in 2020, a healthy 10.53% CAGR over the 2020-2026 period. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event Interestingly, Gupta led off with articulating Infineon\u2019s environmental goals. Infineon, for the first time, has set binding targets for carbon dioxide emissions. The company\u2019s stated goal is to reach neutrality by 2030, primarily by avoiding missions. Moreover, the company hopes to realize 70% of the targeted savings by 2025. Smartphone app controlling IoT solutions in the home Courtesy of Infineon Technologies Specific to the IoT space, the company's three strategic pillars are built on a foundation of category-leading products, its longstanding IoT value proposition, and its recognition that trusted partnerships are a necessary success requirement. With over 3 billion IoT-related chips shipped, Infineon plays a significant role in delivering compute, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Human-Machine Interface (HMI) solutions which require low-power, secure microcontroller (MCU) capabilities. Infineon has strong credibility in this space as its original PSoC solutions were launched in 2002. The company also has a significant presence on influential standards as the W-Fi Alliance and Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG). Gupta points out that Infineon\u2019s trusted partnership reputation is underscored by the company\u2019s \u201ccore supplier\u201d presence in 8 of the top 9 IoT companies. This accomplishment is not trivial, and it speaks well of Infineon\u2019s robust solutions roadmap and consistent legacy track record of quality and trust. Spoiler alert: making IoT products is not easy At a high level, the IoT space is populated with scores of companies, often at a startup stage, that have limited engineering development resources. In addition, Infineon\u2019s partners cite connectivity problems, inability to complete product development, budget and resource constraint challenges as their top challenges when bringing IoT products to market. Infineon offers a host of capabilities for the consumer and industrial markets that address the ongoing compute and controls needs common at the IoT edge. For example, Infineon solutions are designed with ultra-low power consumption architectures, delivering extended battery life. Depending on the processing performance requirements of the device, Infineon offers single-core to multi-core products. Infineon\u2019s analog front-end solutions are customizable for easy connection to analog sensors, an essential design-in requirement for resource-strapped partners. On the industrial side, Infineon\u2019s menu of products includes optimized motor and digital power control solutions, lighting controls, and broad industrial communications protocols support. High-visibility customer wins tell the story Many of Infineon\u2019s design wins in the IoT space are confidential at the request of its partners. Infineon\u2019s solutions have a wide presence in the home automation, human interface (e.g., touchscreen), wearables, smart appliances, hearables, lighting, gaming, portable medical and battery-powered device segments. Two prominent public examples include the Oura Ring, a popular personal health tracking device that requires week-long battery life, Bluetooth connectivity and robust local processing power. Infineon also has a technology ingredient presence in Sylvania\u2019s trendy Smart+ Light Bulb, which required broad inoperability (Apple HomeKit and BLE mesh protocol support). In both these cases, Infineon played an influential partner role with wireless certification and development assistance. Overview of IoT Market Segments That Infineon Technologies Participates In Courtesy of Infineon Technologies Last week, Infineon made several announcements to enhance its IoT arsenal. The company launched its CIRRENT Cloud ID Service , a critical security-related service that automates cloud certificate provisioning and IoT device-to-cloud authentication. The company also strengthened its commitment to the smart home by introducing software support for the Matter smart home standard , which will undoubtedly accelerate time to market for new products. Of particular note on the environmental front, Infineon also announced a partnership with the Rainforest Connection that crafted a real-time monitoring system for detecting wildfires in several of the world\u2019s most susceptible forests. Some closing thoughts At its OktoberTech 2021 virtual event last week , Infineon held a half-day business and technology briefing that provided a first-time glimpse into its combined technology umbrella, which now includes the Cypress portfolio. I was particularly impressed with the comments from Infineon\u2019s CEO, Dr. Reinhard Ploss, about the company\u2019s sincere commitment to working with its partners fairly and equitably as it manages the current supply chain problems facing the entire industry, particularly in the automotive space. This type of sentiment speaks well of the company\u2019s management character, and it will pay dividends for the company with its partners after the pandemic-driven supply chain difficulties subside. Infineon appears to have a variety of tailwinds at its back, especially from a market growth, solutions breadth and customer appeal standpoint. The company recognizes the value of strong partnerships and offers multiple enablement tools to ease and optimize design-in work for successive iterations of IoT solutions. The core challenge with the IoT space is that it\u2019s fragmented with numerous participants. Infineon\u2019s go-to-market model (a key advantage) efficiently enables partners at scale, mitigating the difficulty of placing bets on individual winners. With the expansion of improved wireless networking technologies, the development of advanced data analytics, ongoing cost reductions in the cost of connected devices, and a general surge in the adoption of cloud-based platforms, the IoT market is expected to grow positively. Supply chain challenges aside, Infineon has positioned itself in a firm spot to maintain its momentum in the IoT space, with the recent Cypress acquisition strengthening its already strong hand.",

    "full_description": "Apple has been working to make the iPad more laptop-like for years, but with the Scribble feature, Apple takes a different perspective on the iPad workflow and function. First introduced in iPadOS 14, Scribble lets you use an Apple Pencil to physically write in any text box on an iPad, instead of using the on-screen keyboard. Your hand lettering then translates into type, effectively transforming your tablet into an interactive notepad. Scribble is worth exploring if you have a compatible iPad, Apple Pencil, or a compatible stylus. Here\u2019s how to use Scribble with iPadOS 14 or iPadOS 15 . Which iPads support Scribble? Apple Which iPads can actually use Scribble? Not every iPad supports Scribble because you need to have one that supports iPadOS 14 or higher as well as Apple\u2019s stylus , the Apple Pencil. That narrows the field, because while iPadOS 14 is available to a wide number of older iPads , like the iPad Air 2 and older iPad Mini tablets, they may be too old to support the Apple Pencil \u2014 many iPad models predate the Apple Pencil. Every current iPad model works with an Apple Pencil. The entry-level iPad and iPad mini 5 work with the first generation Pencil, while the later Pro and Air models work with the second-generation Pencils. Here\u2019s the current list of all iPads that support Scribble. 2021: iPad Pro 11 , iPad Pro 12.9, iPad , iPad Mini 2020: iPad Air , iPad, iPad Pro 11, iPad Pro 12.9 2019: iPad, iPad Mini, iPad Air 2018: iPad Pro 12.9, iPad Pro 11, iPad 2017: iPad Pro 10.5, iPad Pro 12.9 2016: iPad Pro 9.7 2015: iPad Pro 12.9 In the past, Scribble only worked with Apple\u2019s own Pencil. No longer. For roughly half the price of the Apple Pencil, the Adonit Note+ stylus competes with the Apple Pencil feature set \u2014 especially in pressure sensitivity, tilt detection, and the ability to work with Scribble. Also much less expensive is the Logitech Crayon, which also supports Scribble. Once you\u2019re armed with your Apple Pencil or another compatible stylus, and an iPad running iPadOS 14 or 15, you\u2019re ready to start scribbling. How to use Scribble Getting started with Scribble is easy. First, make sure you have Scribble properly set up. Go to Settings > Apple Pencil and toggle on the setting for Scribble. You can also choose to use the Pencil in Draw Only mode. A Try Scribble exercise is built into the settings, letting you check out its features. Previous Next 1 of 4 After the initial setup, pick up your Pencil and head over to any text box \u2014 the search bar on your browser will do \u2014 and tap it to bring up the keyboard. Now, while the keyboard is active, use your Pencil to write in the text box where text would appear when your type. You should see your handwriting appear on the screen and quickly fade away as iPadOS translates it into text. If you\u2019re not seeing your handwriting appear on the screen, make sure your Apple Pencil is charged and connected and try again. Also, make sure you\u2019re writing in the correct area. Different apps have different area standards for Scribble, with some being quite limited and others being happy for you to scrawl pretty much anywhere. Scribble works in the Notes app where you first tap to reveal the Markup toolbar. Then, in the Markup toolbar, tap the Handwriting tool (to the left of the pen). Write with Apple Pencil or another compatible stylus, and Scribble instantly transforms your scrawl into typed text. Another great use is on the Home screen, where launching the universal search reveals a search box that you can write on. You can likewise use it in HomeKit or Safari to fill in boxes. Whenever you use Scribble, a shortcut palette appears on the bottom of the display, featuring undo and redo buttons, a keyboard shortcut, and the three-dot More button to access additional settings. Deleting and selecting text Scrawling is just the start, though. You can also use Scribble to select and delete text, which makes correcting typos a lot easier. To select text, draw a circle around it. If done correctly, the circle will disappear and a selection box will spring up. If you\u2019d rather delete the text in question, simply scribble it out, like you would for a typo in grade school. The text will then disappear. You can use Scribble and your stylus to insert, select, or join text, words, or whole paragraphs. Insert text via a tap and hold, join by drawing a vertical line, select by drawing a circle around your text to view numerous editing options, and select by double-tapping a word or triple-tapping a paragraph. Once you start using Scribble, the simple gestures will become second nature and another great way to interact with your iPad.

Scientists at the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Kohlenforschung have now found a surprisingly simple way to produce ammonia at ambient temperature\u2014and even at atmospheric pressure\u2014and thus under much milder conditions than those required for the Haber-Bosch process. The reactants are passed through a mill that grinds the catalyst used to facilitate the reaction between the inert nitrogen and hydrogen. The result is a thin but continuous stream of ammonia. Five hundred degrees Celsius and 200 bar\u2014these are the conditions usually required to get nitrogen to combine with hydrogen to generate ammonia. Only in this form can the nitrogen be used by plants. Despite all the controversy surrounding mineral fertilizers, the Haber-Bosch process is making an essential contribution to feeding the growing world population. It is thus no wonder that Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch as well as Max Planck researcher Gerhard Ertl, who elucidated exactly what happens in the process, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Nevertheless, chemists are still fixated on the synthesis of ammonia. \"This has been a dream reaction for 100 years\", says Ferdi Sch\u00fcth, Director at the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Kohlenforschung in M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr. This expresses both how economically important the transformation is and how difficult it is to achieve. Because ammonia is considered a potential storage medium for hydrogen produced with renewable energy , it could become even more important. Chemists would like to dispense with the harsh reaction conditions\u2014also because of the amount of energy required. Considerable efforts have been made to find an alternative method of production: other catalysts, light as an energy source, electrolysis, and even mechanocatalysis\u2014processes that take place in a ball mill. But these methods have yielded only minute amounts of ammonia (if any at all). A higher yield than other alternatives to the Haber-Bosch process When he planned his experiments in the mill, which rolls solids with steel balls, Steffen Reichle did not expect large quantities. \"At the beginning, I was concerned mainly with how to detect very small amounts of ammonia\", says the chemist, who is doing his Ph.D. at the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Kohlenforschung. At atmospheric pressure , the gas formed only with a volume fraction of around 0.1%. At 20 bar, however, it was produced at 0.26 percent by volume and under further optimized conditions, at 0.4 percent. That is enough to be able to detect the product with conventional measuring methods and certainly more than previous approaches to finding an alternative route to the Haber-Bosch process have produced. \"And with technical optimisations, we can probably increase the yield even more\", says Reichle. He also designed the process in such a way that the feedstock can be continuously passed through the ball mill and the ammonia flows steadily out of the reaction vessel. The chemical industry prefers such processes because they are easier to handle than those in which the reactants must be combined in portions in a closed vessel and the reaction constantly interrupted in order to isolate the product. Caesium as a kind of chemical pixie dust The chemists achieved the relatively high yield in ammonia synthesis in the ball mill by first searching for the optimal catalyst. Specifically, they wanted to enhance the effects of iron, an essential component of the conventional Haber-Bosch catalyst. They did so by mixing the alkali metal caesium with the iron powder. Combined with the mechanical forces of the grinding balls, the additive activated the catalyst to such an extent that the inert nitrogen combined with the hydrogen even under relatively mild conditions. The researchers have several possible explanations for the stimulating effect of caesium. However, it is still unknown why the simple grinding process boosts the reaction. They now want to get to the bottom of that. \"If we gain a better understanding of what exactly happens in the process, we may be able to find a way to further increase the yield of ammonia\", says Sch\u00fcth. The ball mill could then also become the means of choice for ammonia synthesis\". Explore further",

The early reviews are here to go in-depth on the new design, spatial audio support, and much more. Head below for the full details on everything you need to know\u2026 AirPods 3 reviews The biggest change for AirPods 3 is the new design, which heavily resembles AirPods Pro, but without the replaceable ear tips. The Verge writes that even if AirPods 1 or AirPods 2 didn\u2019t fit your ears, AirPods 3 might: Apple says it conducted a ton of user research when designing the third-generation AirPods, involving thousands of ear scans, heat maps, and so on. And at least in my case, something about the new shape definitely works better. They\u2019re staying put so well that I no longer feel the same anxiety about them tumbling onto the ground and down a sewer grate. That worry was always present with the older AirPods. The healthy dose of ambient sound remains, and I\u2019m just someone who prefers earbuds that offer some quiet from the outside world. But I can finally say that Apple\u2019s regular AirPods fit me, and that was never true previously. If you had issues with the original design, it\u2019s worth giving these a try. TechCrunch describes AirPods 3 as \u201cunquestionably\u201d more comfortable than their predecessors: The more contoured third-generation buds are unquestionably more comfortable than their predecessors, but the gulf between them and the Pros feels like night and day. That\u2019s likely to be even more the case for people with smaller ears \u2014 having different-sized, removable tips is a lifesaver for some. The seal those tips provide also create passive noise canceling through a physical seal that effectively keeps in more audio frequencies and blocks out ambient noise. The Wall Street Journal notes that for many people, AirPods Pro are still the right choice \u2013 especially if you can find them on sale: Rubbery eartips aren\u2019t for everyone, but I still believe the Pros are the best earbuds iPhone users can buy. They\u2019re just $70 more, so they pose a confusing decision for upgraders. (Plus, we\u2019ve seen sales at Target and Staples where the premium earbuds are marked down to $199.) This past week, I really missed the Pros\u2019 active noise cancellation. Walking down the street I had to crank up the AirPods\u2019 volume to hear a podcast. And later, while working from home, I couldn\u2019t tune out my neighbor\u2019s leaf blower. The Pros\u2019 noise cancellation isn\u2019t as good as what you get in over-ear headphones, but it\u2019s better than the in-ear competition. Engadget has high praise for the sound quality of AirPods 3: I don\u2019t want to mince words here: the new AirPods sound so much better than the previous two versions. Like almost night and day better. Apple didn\u2019t make any significant changes to sound quality from the first model to the 2019 version. But for gen three, Apple paired a custom driver with a high-dynamic-range amplifier to improve the audio chops. The company says that the duo work together to produce \u201crich consistent bass\u201d and \u201ccrisp, clean\u201d highs. From the moment I fired up the first song, this was all immediately evident. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever audibly said \u201cwoah\u201d with the first note from a guitar on any review unit, but given how average older AirPods sound, it was involuntary this time. Gizmodo on the new MagSafe Charging Case: It turns out, while you can\u2019t attach a tiny card wallet to the back of the AirPods charging case, it will do the same thing the iPhone 12 and 13 models do when dropped onto a MagSafe-compatible wireless charging pad. The case will perfectly align itself with the charging coil, and magnetically secure itself to the pad, so it\u2019s almost impossible to accidentally knock it off during a charge. It works great, and is especially useful given how small the wireless receiver on the AirPods charging case is. Apple also added the feature to the AirPods Pro\u2019s charging case last week, which makes sense. As far as I\u2019m concerned, magnets should be added to the Qi standard and be included with every wireless charging product.

LG's current PC lineup is centered on its Gram series of ultralight laptops. Since Chromebooks employ low-power parts, heat can be more manageable, allowing for thin and fanless designs. This also makes them a good option for travel. Advertisement As noted by Chrome Unboxed, LG made a Chrome OS-based all-in-one PC, aka a Chromebase , in 2014 but couldn't compete with Windows and macOS rivals. Enlarge / LG Chromebase 22CV241-W. LG If LG does release a Chromebook, it will be interesting to see if it gets LG's Gram branding. Currently, all of LG's Gram laptops are thin-and-lights with Intel chips. The brand also makes a couple of AMD Ryzen-powered clamshells with LG Ultra PC branding. An LG Gram Chromebook would imply Intel chips. Alternatively, LG could end the idea of its Gram laptops needing to be part of the Intel Evo certification program for ultrabooks and let the Chromebook stand on the names of LG and Chromebook alone\u2014or even launch a new brand just for Chrome OS devices. LG's AMD PCs start at an MSRP of $800 , while the cheapest Gram-branded PC starts at $1,000 . An LG Chromebook would bring Google's OS pretty close to ubiquity among all major US PC brands, though Razer, MSI, and Microsoft don\u2019t sell Chromebooks.",

    "full_description": "Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University have found new ways of controlling how heat flows through thin materials by stacking atomically thin layers of atoms into van der Waals heterostructures. By comparing different stacks of different materials, or even the same material after heat treatment, they found that weak coupling and mismatch between layers helped significantly reduce heat transport. Their finding promises sensitive control of heat flow at the nanoscale in thermoelectric devices. Heat is everywhere, and it flows. Heat in the wrong places can also be damaging. Examples include overheating electronics, as microchips produce more heat than they can move away while they carry out intensive computational tasks. This can damage or severely reduce the lifetime of electronic devices, making control of heat flow at the nanoscale a pressing concern for modern society. A team led by Professor Kazuhiro Yanagi of Tokyo Metropolitan University has been working on ways to produce and handle ultrathin layers of a class of materials known as transition metal dichalcogenides. Here, they took layers of molybdenum disulfide and molybdenum diselenide a single atom thick and stacked them together into layers of four (4L films). The layers could be coupled together in different ways. The team's unique, gentle way of transferring large single atom-thin sheets allowed them to create stacks of layers bound together by van der Waals forces. They could also be strongly bound by more conventional techniques, specifically chemical vapor deposition (CVD). This gives rise to a number of permutations for how isolated layers could be put together, and potentially control how heat gets through them. By using a special coating technique, they were able to detect how miniscule amounts of heat flowed past these stacks with rather good accuracy. Firstly, they found that layers strongly bound by CVD let through significantly more heat than their loosely bound counterparts. This effect could be partially reversed by annealing weakly held layers, making the binding stronger and improving upon the transport of heat. Furthermore, they compared stacks of four molybdenum sulfide layers to a \"lasagna\"-like structure made of alternating layers of molybdenum sulfide and molybdenum selenide. Such heterostructures had an artificial structural mismatch between adjacent layers of atoms which led to significantly lower levels of heat transfer, more than 10 times less than with strongly bound layers. The team's findings not only demonstrate a new technical development but provide general design rules on how one might control how heat flows at the nanoscale, whether you want more or less flow. These insights will lead tothe development of ultrathin, ultralight insulators as well as new thermoelectric materials, where heat might be effectively channeled for conversion into electricity.

NASA/CXC/A.Jubett For the very first time astronomers may have detected a planet outside of the Milky Way\u2014and it could be the size of Saturn. The so-called \u201cextroplanet\u201d is in the Whirlpool Galaxy, also called M51, a spiral galaxy a massive 28 million light-years distant. Astronomers have found over 4,000 \u201cexoplanets\u201d\u2014a planet that orbits a star outside our Solar System\u2014so far, but until now all have been within our own Milky Way galaxy. This new planet, which eclipsed an X-ray source called \u201cM51-ULS-1,\u201d is thousands of times farther away. Since it\u2019s located outside the Milky Way it\u2019s being called a \u201cextroplanet.\u201d Researchers using NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory detected dimming of X-rays in a planetary system where a Sun-like star is in orbit around a neutron star (the collapsed core of a massive supergiant star) or a black hole. It\u2019s thought that the dimming was being caused by a planet passing in front of\u2014and therefore eclipsing\u2014the neutron star or black hole emitting the X-ray light. The research could open a new window to search for these so-called extroplanets. A composite image of M51 with X-rays from Chandra and optical light from NASA's Hubble Space ... [+] Telescope contains a box that marks the location of the possible planet candidate. X-ray: NASA/CXC/SAO/R. DiStefano, et al.; Optical: NASA/ESA/STScI/Grendler MORE FOR YOU New Research Finds A Connection Between Domestic Violence And These Two Personality Disorders This Scientist Helps Andean Forests And Ecuador\u2019s Women In STEM Exceptional Fossil Preservation Suggests That Discovering Dinosaur DNA May Not Be Impossible The paper, published in the latest issue of Nature Astronomy , details their search for X-ray transits in three galaxies beyond the Milky Way galaxy, using both Chandra and the European Space Agency\u2019s XMM-Newton . Their search covered 55 systems in the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51), 64 systems in the Pinwheel Galaxy (M101) and 119 systems the Sombrero Galaxy (M104). Their only success was in M51-ULS-1 in the Whirlpool Galaxy, a binary system contains a black hole or neutron star orbiting a companion star with a mass about 20 times that of the Sun. \u201cWe are trying to open up a whole new arena for finding other worlds by searching for planet candidates at X-ray wavelengths, a strategy that makes it possible to discover them in other galaxies,\u201d said Rosanne Di Stefano of the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian (CfA) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who led the study. Astronomers have found evidence for a possible planet candidate in the M51 (\"Whirlpool\") galaxy. NASA/CXC/A.Jubett This artist\u2019s impression, above, illustrates the X-ray binary and possible planet. It shows material from the white and blue companion star being pulled onto the neutron star or black hole, forming a disk around the dense object as red and orange. The researchers explain in their paper how the material near the dense object becomes superheated, causing it to glow in white X-ray light. During the observation the X-ray light source dimmed over about three hours. The potential eclipser is most likely to be the size of Saturn, say the researchers, and orbit the neutron star or black hole at about twice the distance of Saturn from our Sun. \u201cWe know we are making an exciting and bold claim so we expect that other astronomers will look at it very carefully,\u201d said co-author Julia Berndtsson of Princeton University in New Jersey. \u201cWe think we have a strong argument, and this process is how science works.\u201d Possible orbits of the planet candidate in the M51 (\"Whirlpool\") galaxy. NASA/CXC/M. Weiss The transit method is how most exoplanets are found in our own Milky Way galaxy. Normally, astronomers record the brightness of distant stars, and if they dim slightly, interpret that as an eclipse by a planet\u2014and so the first evidence that a planet must be moving in front of it, as seen from our telescopes\u2019 perspective. It\u2019s then possible to measure any brightness dips to calculate: sizes of planets. how far away the planets are from their stars. gather evidence of what they\u2019re made of by analysing the starlight that shines through the planet\u2019s atmosphere. Of course, other galaxies should host planetary systems, but scientists can\u2019t detect them using the same methods\u2014our telescopes just aren\u2019t powerful enough. This light curve shows how X-rays from M51-ULS-1 temporarily decrease to zero during the Chandra ... [+] observations. NASA/CXC/SAO/R. DiStefano, et al. So the transit method isn\u2019t quite what happened at M51-ULS-1, but something did pass across the X-ray source along Earth\u2019s line of sight to temporarily block most or all of the X-rays. It\u2019s thought that this technique could be used to find more planet candidates, but the scientists are not yet certain that M51-ULS-1 does indeed host a planet. Since it appears to have a large orbit, the candidate planet won\u2019t cause another eclipse for another 70 years. \u201cUnfortunately to confirm that we\u2019re seeing a planet we would likely have to wait decades to see another transit,\u201d said co-author Nia Imara of the University of California at Santa Cruz. \u201cAnd because of the uncertainties about how long it takes to orbit, we wouldn't know exactly when to look.\u201d Wishing you clear skies and wide eyes.",

    "full_description": "Ahead of COP26 in Glasgow, the University of Surrey has published a paper in Sustainability detailing how it will reduce its carbon emissions and reach Net-Zero by 2030. In the paper, Surrey's researchers share ideas and provide guidance on how other universities can apply the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). The science-based pathway to Net-Zero laid down by the University can be followed by other educational institutions. Many of the approaches are also replicable by private, public and charitable organizations of a similar size. In addition to providing guidance, the paper also considers how to finance emission reduction pathways. If current high energy prices are sustained, the financial cases presented in the paper will be even stronger. The University of Surrey is a leading UK university with an annual turnover of around \u00a3300m. Sustainability research is a vital part of research activity across the University, for example, at its Centre of Environment and Sustainability. Sustainability forms a central pillar across the teaching curriculum. Solar and renewable energies are a major theme within the research undertaken by the Advanced Technology Institute at the University of Surrey. Actions the University will take to reduce its absolute carbon emissions by 46% over the next ten years (based on 2018/2019 emission levels) and achieve Net-Zero include: Professor Ravi Silva, Director of the Advanced Technology Institute at the University of Surrey, said that \"there is a moral obligation for all deep-thinking organizations to champion change, and, with the expertise we have at the University of Surrey, we can lead the way in accurately calculating carbon emissions and developing robust plans to become carbon neutral. Our study offers advice and ideas, evidence and case studies , methods that other organizations can adopt to do their bit to tackle climate change. We all have a role to play.\" The plan tackles Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, relating to direct and indirect emissions from owned or controlled sources and purchased energy . Work has begun to calculate and reduce Scope 3 emissions, covering indirect emissions that occur in the value chain, for example, through a reduction in flights taken and a sustainable procurement policy. More substantial baselining is taking place through 2021, which will subsequently be incorporated into the plan. The University will publish progress on its pathway to Net-Zero in an annual sustainability report. By 2022, it will create an external-facing dashboard of emission data to facilitate transparent reporting, monitor progress towards Net-Zero targets and engage staff and students on climate action.

    "full_description": "For the last two days, the Google Pixel 6 Pro has been my main smartphone, with the Pixel 6 also in tow, and although that\u2019s not enough time to fully evaluate it for a review, it is enough time to be seriously impressed by several aspects. Here are the best parts of the Pixel 6 Pro that I couldn\u2019t wait to tell you about, along with a few not-so-good things that I will be looking at very closely over the next week or so as I prepare my final review. Let\u2019s start with what has really impressed me. Design, materials, and colors What an absolute breath of fresh air the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are. A far cry from the boredom of the old Pixel models, the new phones look and feel like they cost more than they actually do. They are very different, happily, from the understated-to-the-point-of-invisibility design ethos of their predecessors. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends While you may initially think these are two-tone phones, they\u2019re actually not. The Sorta Sunny 6 Pro in our photos is cream, pink, black, and gold, and it\u2019s lovely. What\u2019s clever is despite using a light color palette, it\u2019s balanced and classy enough for everyone. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends The Seafoam Pixel 6 is fresh and fun, but toned down compared to the Sorta Sunny model through the use of a matte black chassis. On each phone, the chassis is metal, the back is made of glossy glass, and even though the camera module protrudes from the body quite a lot, it doesn\u2019t ruin the style. In fact, it adds to it \u2014 Pixel 6 phones look different, interesting, and individual. Pixel 6 (left) and Pixel 6 Pro (right). Andy Boxall/Digital Trends The build quality is also excellent, with all the panels and the curved screen meeting the chassis perfectly for a comfortable grip. These are without a doubt the best-looking Pixel phones Google has made and my favorite design to date. Camera performance The improved camera specs and Google\u2019s track record mean we are expecting great things from the Pixel 6 Pro\u2019s camera. The large 1/1.31-inch 50-megapixel main camera is joined by a 48MP telephoto camera with 4x optical zoom, plus a 12MP wide-angle camera. The main and telephoto cameras have optical image stabilization, and of course, it all makes use of Google\u2019s famed computational photography technology. Previous Next 1 of 10 Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Portrait mode Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Wide-angle Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends 4x optical zoom Andy Boxall/Digital Trends I\u2019m around 100 photos into using the Pixel 6 Pro, and it\u2019s already been giving me impressive results. Color accuracy, white balance, and exposure are practically perfect, giving photos a breathtakingly natural look. It accomplishes this without compromising on HDR effects or necessitating other tweaks to make pictures pop, which helps provide that shareability we want. All the desirable versatility is also there with the wide-angle and telephoto camera. The main camera\u2019s large sensor adds lovely natural bokeh, the Pixel\u2019s autofocus and tracking are still superb, and the app is well designed, fast, and easy to use. What am I looking out for the more I use it? The large sensor has trouble focusing if you get too close to your subject, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be a macro mode onboard, but switching to the optical zoom does help alleviate problems. I\u2019m also going to keep looking at the consistency between the main and wide-angle cameras, as it\u2019s not great so far. Previous Next 1 of 4 Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends However, as you\u2019ll see from the examples, the Pixel 6 Pro still looks to continue the tradition of having among the very best cameras found on a smartphone. Magic Eraser Once only available to Photoshop experts, the Android 12 feature called Magic Eraser removes those unwanted distractions from your photos, all with a simple gesture. Tap or circle the offending article in your photo, and Google\u2019s artificial intelligence (A.I.) and object recognition technology removes it in a flash. Found in the Google Photos app, you can even see it working after you select the area to remove, as it briefly highlights the edge of whatever it is that\u2019s about to be zapped into digital oblivion. Previous Next 1 of 4 Before Magic Eraser Andy Boxall/Digital Trends After Magic Eraser Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Before Magic Eraser Andy Boxall/Digital Trends After Magic Eraser Andy Boxall/Digital Trends It\u2019s very easy to use, and takes just a second to work, but is it any good? It\u2019s really is, but with a few caveats. If you zoom in, you\u2019ll definitely be able to spot some blurring and pixelation where something was removed, but it\u2019s not all the time and depends on the object. Simple shapes are removed without too much fuss, but anything too complex will confuse it. The secret is not to go crazy and try to delete everything. I kept Magic Eraser and its effectiveness in mind when taking photos, choosing a slightly different angle based on what it can and cannot cleanly remove. Take a look at the photo example with the blue car. I could easily remove the lamppost, the paved sections along the bottom of the frame, some items in the road, and even the window in the building in the top left of the picture. However, it had a harder time removing the two cars on the right, due to the complexity of both the shape and the background. It also doesn\u2019t recognize the shadows as part of the object to remove, and this makes it a little messy. It\u2019s impossible to remove the silver car due to it blending into the front of the blue car. It\u2019s not perfect, but for the basics, like the lamppost, it\u2019s incredibly effective. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Magic Eraser\u2019s speed and simplicity makes it even better. You don\u2019t have to learn anything or have any experience with photo editing, and while taking your time to make selections or redo them can produce better results, it\u2019s not essential if it\u2019s a basic shape. It\u2019s easy to undo actions, and Google Photos saves the modified image as a copy automatically so you don\u2019t lose the original. Assistant Voice Typing Using Google Assistant to type, edit, and send messages is an Android 12 feature exclusive to the Pixel 6, and it\u2019s excellent. With the command, \u201cHey Google, type,\u201d the Assistant listens and transcribes what you say into your message, and will even send the message when you ask, making the process almost entirely handsfree. The best thing is that it\u2019s incredibly accurate. Assistant Voice Typing on the @madebygoogle #Pixel6Pro is quite impressive. I\u2019ve used it a lot this weekend, when I couldn\u2019t be bothered to type, and it\u2019s really accurate. Here\u2019s a quick demo in WhatsApp: pic.twitter.com/25vw0631Ql \u2014 Andy Boxall (@AndyBoxall) October 25, 2021 I\u2019ve voice typed SMS messages, WhatsApp messages, and even tweets, but you can seemingly use it throughout the operating system, and provided I speak clearly and at normal conversational speed, it has been almost faultless, and that includes adding punctuation without me asking. I can even tell it to add an emoji, clear the last sentence, or start all over again, all without touching the screen. It\u2019s genuinely faster than typing. Downsides? It\u2019s not so natural to edit messages with your voice, as you have to tap any wrongly heard message and spell it out. It\u2019s quicker to manually change it by typing on the keyboard. However, it doesn\u2019t happen very often, and that\u2019s what makes the feature so impressive. The Pixel 6\u2019s new Tensor processor plays a big part in the Assistant Voice Typing\u2019s success. Quick Tap Activating Assistant Voice Typing requires a vocal command, after activating the Assistant. There\u2019s no dedicated Google Assistant button on the Pixel 6, with Google expecting you to use the power key instead, but this is exceptionally annoying , as is using the wake word. Use the \u201cHey Google, type\u201d command in the same room as any other Assistant-powered device, and there is confusion. My Google Home almost always tells me the time after I ask my phone to type . Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Enter Quick Tap, a Pixel-exclusive feature in Android 12. Two taps on the back of the Pixel 6 activates a feature of your choice, and one of the options is Google Assistant. I\u2019ve been using this to get around using the wake word before asking the phone to type something, but there are other options if you\u2019re looking to take a screenshot, show notifications, or open a specific app. Quick Tap is accurate and reacts quickly enough to be useful, although the contact area on the back of the phone is quite small. There\u2019s even a lovely haptic vibration when it\u2019s activated. Using Quick Tap this way means the power button can still be left for power menu duties, without having to resort to using the \u201cHey Google\u201d wake word when you want to use the voice typing feature. While I\u2019m enjoying life with the Pixel 6 Pro so far, there are a few things that require more time to fully evaluate. Let\u2019s move on to the things about the two phones that I still need to examine. None are serious problems, but all are reasons why a full review takes time. I won\u2019t know if these are true downsides of the phone, or just isolated issues that are quickly cured or ignored until I\u2019ve used it for longer. Not enough difference in size The Pixel 6 is not a small phone, so don\u2019t let the absence of the Pro nomenclature lead you to believe it\u2019s the size equivalent of the Pixel 5 . It\u2019s practically identical in width \u2014 a mere 1mm difference \u2014 so despite being a little shorter than the 6 Pro, it\u2019s no easier to use with one hand. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are big smartphones, and both are heavy, with the Pixel 6 weighs 207 grams compared to the Pixel 6 Pro\u2019s 210 grams. This leaves anyone wanting a smaller Google phone with just the Pixel 5a , and for me, hardly varying the size of the phone between the 6 and 6 Pro seems like a missed opportunity. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends There\u2019s also a considerable difference in the screen between the two, with the Pixel 6 using a flat screen with large bezels, compared to the curved, considerably less bezeled Pixel 6 Pro\u2019s. Google\u2019s decision on differentiating the two phones is reminiscent of Samsung\u2019s approach to the Galaxy Note 20 and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra . Battery life Battery life has never been a Pixel phone strong point. Google hedges its bets by saying the 4,900mAh battery will last for \u201c24 hours-plus,\u201d but so far, after two charges, the Pixel 6 Pro almost certainly can\u2019t meet the \u201cplus\u201d part of this statement. It\u2019s harsh to judge battery life after such a short time, though, as the phone has not learned my usage and app patterns yet, which can improve things after a week or so. But I don\u2019t expect it to end up being a multiday battery winner. Super slippery The Pixel 6 Pro is a wide, heavy phone with glossy glass on the back, and it\u2019s a slippery devil. It not only slips through my hands rather easily, but it slides around on many different surfaces, too. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Yes, it has Corning\u2019s Gorilla Glass Victus over the screen and Gorilla Glass 6 on the back, but this isn\u2019t a rugged phone, and one significant drop could be all it takes to crack the phone. A case should be considered essential. Screen sensitivity I\u2019ve been opening apps, swiping to Google Discover, and accidentally interacting with notifications, all without intending to do so. The Pixel 6 Pro\u2019s screen is very sensitive, and not just on the curved sides either. It\u2019s not very good at recognizing my hand on the screen when I\u2019m just holding the phone or picking it up, which results in this accidental usage. A software update often cures this type of issue, which isn\u2019t that uncommon on phones I use ahead of release. Biometric security Neither Pixel 6 phone has face unlock, meaning you rely on the fingerprint sensor for biometric security. Face unlock is a very helpful time-saver, and because these are large phones, unlocking using the fingerprint sensor takes a few beats too long. I\u2019ve been using Google\u2019s Smart Lock feature so the phone stays unlocked when it\u2019s with me, or when I\u2019m at home. However, it\u2019s not always very accurate, and you still need to swipe the phone\u2019s screen, unlike when directly unlocking with your face. Over the next few days, I want to see if this makes the Pixel 6 Pro frustrating to use, compared to phones that include face unlock. Price and availability This is a set of early impressions, based on around 48 hours use of the Pixel 6 Pro, with a short time spent with the Pixel 6, too. Both phones can be pre-ordered ready for general release on October 28, with the Pixel 6 costing $599 and the Pixel 6 Pro $849. Our full reviews will be out very soon.

The Pixel 5, despite being a relatively good phone, was a low point for the entire series. But finally, everything seems to have clicked into place. The Pixel 6 Pro is Google\u2019s first true flagship with top-tier specs and the company\u2019s own chipset under the hood, and it\u2019s exactly what Google needed to put out at this moment in time. Hardware A new take on Google\u2019s smartphone design Starting with the Pixel 2 and ramping up from there, Google\u2019s design for Pixel smartphones fell in line with the company\u2019s other products \u2013 This is to say they felt somehow more \u201chuman\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d than other Android phones. They were never flashy or attention-grabbing, just practical designs that got the job done while looking aesthetically pleasing (notches aside). That changes with the Pixel 6 Pro, a flashy flagship that looks like it came straight out of the minds of Samsung and OnePlus. The glossy glass back, polished aluminum frame, and curved display sides all bring up the memory of a typical Android flagship more than they do a Google device. Over the past week using the Pixel 6 Pro, I\u2019ve concluded that this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. The look of the Pixel 6 Pro is by no means offensive, and it still stands out. Unique choices from Google, such as the large \u201cvisor\u201d camera module and the dual-tone colors, ensure that you won\u2019t confuse the Pixel for something from Samsung or OnePlus at a glance. Yet, the other choices make it feel like Google is trying to keep up with its direct competition. When it comes to the colors, I think the \u201cSorta Sunny\u201d color variant pictured here is by far the best one you can get on the Pro model. It\u2019s still a bit dull for my taste, but the subtle gold shades look really nice in person. I just wish Google hadn\u2019t fallen into the same trap as Samsung in thinking that \u201cPro\u201d customers want the dullest colors in existence but instead had embraced bright and fun colors to go with Material You. In the hand, the feel is a bit of a mixed bag. The glossy glass is far from my favorite design trait, but the oleophobic coating feels quite good in the hand. The polished aluminum frame, too, is comfortable. However, the two together are a slippery pair that had me rushing to slap on a case. I really would have preferred if Google used the matte black coating from the standard model on the frame of the Pro device, as it\u2019s a nice change of pace from your typical smartphone design and adds both grip and a \u201csoft\u201d element to the design. Matte glass would have only sweetened the deal. Also notable is the camera module, which juts out the back of the device. It\u2019s certainly large, but I found it entirely acceptable. Its wide stance means the phone won\u2019t rock on a table, and it\u2019s not so large that it gets caught on your pocket. With a case on, it\u2019s not even noticeable. What is still a little noticeable is that the camera module rattles a bit more than others. All phones with OIS rattle when you shake them, but the Pixel 6 Pro is louder. This is something that\u2019ll probably annoy you for a couple of hours, but after that, I forgot about it entirely. The other little quirk about the device is the plastic \u201cantenna window\u201d at the top of the frame. The \u201cwindow\u201d is used for the mmWave 5G radio and isn\u2019t unique to the Pixel, but Google\u2019s version is larger and more obvious than others. It\u2019s almost an eyesore since it\u2019s visible from the front, but once again, a case quickly solves that problem. The Pixel 6 Pro is the elephant in the room Feel and design aside, we\u2019ve got to talk about the physical size of this phone. Looking at the Pixel lineup in a bubble, it is massive . The 6.7-inch display on the Pixel 6 Pro is the largest ever on a Pixel device and you feel every single bit of that size while holding the device. Coming from last year\u2019s Pixel 5 is a jarring change, and even from older big phones such as the Pixel 4 XL, it\u2019s a major increase in size. In this case, a picture truly is worth a thousand words. After using the Pro for a while, I\u2019ve still not gotten entirely used to the size, as it feels a bit too tall and especially wide for my liking. Your tastes may vary, though, and if you\u2019ve ever used a phone over 6.5-inches from the likes of Samsung or OnePlus, you\u2019ll feel right at home with this hardware. Google isn\u2019t exactly breaking ground on smartphone size here, but it\u2019s a definite change of pace compared to what we\u2019re used to seeing from the company. Even previous XL phones felt more manageable since their smaller screen-to-body ratios kept more things in reach. If the smaller sizes of Pixel hardware is what drew you to the lineup, you need not apply for the Pro. A welcome return for high-res displays The display is arguably the most important part of your phone, as it\u2019s what you interact with at all times. After two generations of missteps \u2013 Pixel 4\u2019s green tint and Pixel 5\u2019s lower resolution \u2013 Google is finally back on the right track with the Pixel 6 Pro. The 6.7-inch display on the Pro, while huge, gets the job done very well. The LTPO AMOLED panel shows vivid colors and gets bright enough for use even outdoors. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S21 Ultra certainly still has an edge here, but Google\u2019s display has no apparent flaws and truly competes with the best of the best. And the return to offering a QHD+ display is refreshing. In terms of the refresh rate, 120Hz feels right at home with the animations of Android 12, and, with the optimizations Google already has on Pixels, 120Hz has never felt smoother to me on an Android device. Google also seems to be taking slightly better advantage of the adaptive refresh rate than other OEMs. When I turn on Android\u2019s developer option for showing the current frame rate, I see the number dip from 120 to 60 far more often than, say, an S21 Ultra. Things ramp up to 120 when scrolling, but even just a brief pause on the homescreen knocks it down to 60. It\u2019s not as advanced as what the iPhone 13 Pro pulls off, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction for sure. Software & Performance Material You is an absolute delight These latest Pixel phones are the first smartphones to ship with Android 12 and Google\u2019s new design language, Material You. As we\u2019ve covered through the extensive beta period, Android 12 and Material You are a great evolution of the operating system. They feel right at home on this new hardware. Material You on Android 12 is all about color and, more specifically, changing the colors of your apps and the OS as a whole to suit your style, all generated based on your wallpapers. Changing your wallpaper to one of the many included on the Pixel 6 Pro or to something you picked out yourself results in the OS changing to match that new accent. In my case, I ended up settling on two of Google\u2019s \u201cMotif\u201d wallpapers that both have a strong yellow accent that the OS picked up on. It matches well with the \u201cSorta Sunny\u201d hardware I\u2019ve been using, and the bright yellows look excellent with this display through the settings, accents, and apps that support it. On that note, Google throws in a nice touch with the startup screen on the Pixel 6 Pro matching the color you purchase. This unit had a subtle gold accent color while my red Pixel 6 had a muted red palette to work with. \ud83d\udcf8 Google \u2018Motif\u2019 Collection \ud83d\udcf8 Google \u2018Motif\u2019 Collection \ud83d\udcf8 Ben Schoon \ud83d\udcf8 Melissa Schoon The unfortunate bit about Android 12, though, is that it just doesn\u2019t feel done. Bugs and visual errors from the beta program still persist even on this fresh new hardware, and it can be genuinely frustrating at times to see an app crash for no reason or find a glaring bug that hasn\u2019t been patched. Google was, of course, right to launch the Pixel 6 series with Android 12, but one can only hope that the next two or three month updates do a number on filling in the cracks. Or, perhaps, Android 12.1 will do it . Tensor puts out an impressive first showing While the software running on this device is perhaps its biggest strength, we first have to talk about what runs the show \u2013 Tensor. The Google Tensor chipset within the Pixel 6 Pro sets the stage for Google phones for years to come, and it\u2019s legitimately impressive how strong the company\u2019s initial offering is. In my testing over the past week, performance from Tensor has been virtually indistinguishable from the Snapdragon 888 used in recent Samsung and OnePlus flagships. The vast majority of my tasks were general smartphone usage, but everything held up without skipping a beat. If anything, the usual optimization Google does with its clean Android build felt faster on the Pixel 6 Pro than the versions skinned by One UI and OxygenOS. Games were pleasant as well, in my limited testing. I\u2019m not much of a mobile gamer, but tests over the course of about an hour with titles including Asphalt 9, League of Legends: Wild Rift, and Civilization 6 came with performance that felt on par with a high-end Snapdragon chip and equally expected battery drain. I did notice that the phone started to warm up relatively quickly, but even as I continued pushing it, the heat didn\u2019t get unbearable by any means. Typically, we avoid benchmarks as they\u2019re not necessarily representative of user experience, but they are useful in showing the raw performance difference between Tensor and its direct competition. And, really, it just reinforces how close these chips are. In Geekbench 5, the Pixel 6 Pro came out with a single-core score of 1007 and a multi-core score of 2765 in one test. Breaking that down, the single-core score is pretty much at the top of the charts, beating the Exynos 2100-powered Galaxy S21 Ultra by around 50 points and falling just shy of the Snapdragon 888 version (running Android 12) by 10 points. The multi-core score, on the other hand, fell around 300 points lower than the Exynos 2100 and 400 points behind the Snapdragon 888. Notably, I was not able to run compute benchmark tests on the Pixel 6 Pro as the test crashes before completing each time I\u2019ve tried, and, in some cases, the benchmark scores were inconsistent and sometimes showed much lower scores. The cause for this is unclear. The numbers, as we mentioned, really don\u2019t mean anything, but these tests do show us that Tensor is up to the task of competing with the best processors currently used in Android phones. Even though Google falls just shy of its competition, Qualcomm should absolutely be on notice that Google got this close on its first try. But what does this mean in real life? Tensor makes its presence felt in a few key areas, for one, the camera. Processing photos is faster than it\u2019s ever been on Pixel devices, even compared to the older models that had the Pixel Visual Core. This extends over to video, which now has that stunning Live HDR effect. Voice actions also feel just a bit more responsive to me, and on-device AI features such as Magic Eraser are remarkably fast and accurate. I\u2019m sure a lot of this could have been done with a Snapdragon 888 and co-processors today, but the fact that Google has more control makes me excited for what this chip\u2019s successors will make possible. Tensor, as it stands today, is just scratching the surface. Android 12 as a whole on the Pixel 6 Pro runs like a dream on Tensor. Though, I did notice one quirk with notifications being delayed on occasion. This was rare, and our Editor-In-Chief Abner Li didn\u2019t observe the same behavior on his unit, but it was a little strange to see this quirk on a Pixel which, generally, are very reliable for that sort of thing. Most likely, this can be chalked up to Adaptive Battery still learning my habits in the too-brief time we\u2019ve had to use the phone. One fear I had ahead of Tensor\u2019s launch was that third-party apps might not play with it very nicely, but this seems to be a fear that was not realized. I only ran into two issues with third-party apps on this device, with Geekbench 5\u2019s Compute test crashing inexplicably and Feedly crashing on login. These might be related to the chip switch, but there\u2019s no evidence to back that up that I could see. More likely, it\u2019s related to Android 12 being a little rough around the edges. As a side note, Tensor also brings with it one of the first widely available non-Qualcomm modems we\u2019re seeing in an Android phone in the US, the Samsung 5123. Not much is known about this modem, but anecdotally I\u2019ve had no issues with connectivity running on Google Fi with both LTE and 5G in the Winston-Salem, NC area. Signal strength and speeds have been consistent with Qualcomm devices I\u2019ve tested on the same network in the same region. Google\u2019s clever tricks remain a key selling point The past week has reminded me how much I love using a Pixel. The mediocre performance of the Pixel 5 last year left me mostly sticking with other devices such as the Galaxy Z Fold 2/3 and Galaxy S21 Ultra, but over the past few days, I\u2019ve been reminded why I love using a Pixel so much. Google\u2019s software tricks are just so good, and they can\u2019t be had anywhere else. Call Screen, for instance, is a game-changer for spam calls and cuts down that daily frustration of your \u201ccar\u2019s warranty.\u201d The automatic screening of suspicious numbers makes these interactions seamless and takes numerous distractions out of your day. Fast translations, thanks to Lens and Tensor, feel great, but the thing I\u2019ve really found myself loving is the new voice typing in Gboard that\u2019s powered by Assistant. It\u2019s incredibly fast and accurate, and the automatic punctuation is really the killer feature. I\u2019ve never felt so confident using voice-to-text while walking or in the car (which we should all keep to an absolute minimum regardless). You can even make edits to what\u2019s been dictated without the voice option being turned off. There are several other new features on the Pixel 6. These include improved device search in the app drawer, \u201cDirect my Call,\u201d which displays a visual menu for toll-free lines, and \u201cWait Times,\u201d which shows an estimate of how busy that line may be. These are both brilliant ideas, but I\u2019ve not been able to test them properly. In a test with the DoorDash customer service line, Wait Time worked perfectly, as pictured below, but the Direct my Call menu didn\u2019t trigger on my first go-round. As it turns out, the feature is disabled by default. While trying to get a repair done on a home appliance this week, too, neither feature triggered on the standard Electrolux helpline. There\u2019s potential for both of these, but they probably need a bit of time and wider use until they can manage to work consistently. Wait Time Direct My Call Updated \u2018At a Glance\u2019 Updated \u2018At a Glance\u2019 Google also refreshed its \u201cAt a Glance\u201d widget with the Pixel 6. There is expanded support for new features such as plane tickets, and some third-party apps (such as Adidas) now have calendar integration for quick and easy access on your homescreen. The calendar option works just as well as usual, but I couldn\u2019t test out tickets in such a brief time. I wish At a Glance were an optional part of the Pixel Launcher since Android 12\u2019s new widgets are just so good . Enhanced device search and Quick Tap round things out, but I didn\u2019t find either to be particularly useful. Device search works well for finding on-device content quickly, and Quick Tap is a reliable gesture, but neither has been useful in my own workflow. I\u2019d rather have a customized version of the old \u201csqueeze\u201d feature that triggered Assistant in its place, especially since Google has switched to triggering Assistant using the power button, which does not feel natural to me at all \u2013 luckily, that\u2019s optional. Special features are what really sells the Pixel, and the ones mentioned above just scratch the surface. There are further add-ons in the camera we\u2019ll get to later and long-standing options such as Car Crash Detection. They\u2019re features that will sell phones if Google makes people aware of them. Tensor\u2019s extended support is both great and disappointing One of the biggest advantages you\u2019ll get from buying a Pixel is software updates, and that\u2019s an advantage that\u2019s growing with the Pixel 6 Pro. Thanks to Tensor, Google is extending support beyond the 3-year standard established with previous models. The Pixel 6 Pro is guaranteed security updates for five years after its October 2021 launch, meaning the phone will get monthly patches through October 2026. That alone makes it the best-supported mainstream Android phone on the market. However, it\u2019s not quite as great as it seems. While security patches go out to 2026, major Android updates will stop in 2024, just three years from launch. That\u2019s certainly disappointing since, in theory, Google should be able to support the Pixel 6 for longer since it controls the chipset. Apple supports its iPhones for around six years on major updates, so it\u2019d be nice for Google to get a bit closer. That said, it\u2019s hard to criticize Google for this move. As nice as it would have been to get more, what we\u2019ve got here is a pretty big leap forward for Android, and it only stands to get better from here. This is Google\u2019s first homegrown chip, and it\u2019s going to take time for its benefits to be fully realized. It\u2019s entirely possible that three years from now, Google decides that Tensor can handle another update. The three-year/five-year timeline isn\u2019t a strict cutoff; it\u2019s a guarantee of the \u201cleast\u201d your phone will get. Plus, there\u2019s the fact that updates on Android aren\u2019t quite as crucial as they are on iOS, because Google pushes new features through the Play Store and Play Services, even on system apps. Nearby Share, for instance, was rolled out to every modern Android phone through a simple server-side update; no major system update needed. Major system updates are great, and I do think Google should push them out for at least one more year. Still, security patches are the more crucial part of keeping a phone usable for extended periods of time, and Google has stepped up to improve that timeline on this device. Battery Life & Charging \u2018All-day\u2019 is an accurate measurement Google is advertising the 5,000 mAh battery in the Pixel 6 Pro as lasting \u201call-day\u201d and, in my use so far, that certainly seems accurate. Over this early testing, I\u2019ve had the Pro easily coast from around 8 a.m. to around 11 p.m. without needing a charger. Generally, I go to bed at 11 p.m. or later, and the phone is under 15%, but I consider that solid endurance, all things considered. My use has not been light, either, with screen-on-time ranging from three hours to six hours easily getting me through the day without any battery anxiety. Notably, though, Android 12\u2019s battery screen changes make it very difficult to accurately track these stats between charges, so my figures may be slightly off. This is a phone you can kill in a day, but it\u2019s one that should be more than enough to last most folks their entire day. The worst day I had saw the battery drain to 20% by 8pm, but a 10-minute top off with a high-powered USB-C charger easily gave me enough juice to go well past bedtime. On top of the solid endurance, the Pixel 6 Pro charges up quicker than ever. The USB-C port is capable of 30W speeds \u2013 as long as you\u2019ve got the right charging brick. Unfortunately, Google doesn\u2019t include a charging brick in the box, and it\u2019s not a free add-on either. Instead, it\u2019ll cost you $25 on top of your purchase. I can\u2019t speak to the performance of Google\u2019s charging brick yet, as, somewhat hilariously, it wasn\u2019t provided to the media in advance. Third-party alternatives I\u2019ve tested from Spigen and Anker have worked out just great and seem to live up to Google\u2019s claim of 50% charge in 30 minutes. The other thing that, unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t able to test was faster wireless charging. The Pixel 6 Pro can charge wirelessly at up to 23W, but that speed is limited to the Pixel Stand, which is not yet available for purchase. Standard wireless charging tops off at 12W, and it seems to work just fine for overnight charging. Camera Google reclaims its crown As its competitors have caught up over the past few years, Google\u2019s camera prowess on Pixel phones has diminished, with the crown handed over to Apple and, to a certain extent, Samsung. However, with the Pixel 6 Pro, it feels like Google has taken it back with an impressive new offering. On a hardware level, the Pixel 6 Pro offers a 50MP primary sensor that\u2019s physically larger than the 12MP sensor in previous versions. That\u2019s backed up by a 12MP ultrawide camera and a third 48MP sensor with a telephoto lens. The results coming out of all three sensors have been, in a word, wonderful. The added resolution of the primary sensor adds so much crisp detail to shots, and the larger sensor creates a natural bokeh that adds a beautiful flair to many shots. I\u2019ve been truly blown away by many shots this phone has taken, particularly in the smaller details. In one shot of my dog, the Pixel was able to capture her face in stunning detail that looked identical to real-life while going as far as capturing perfectly the little bits of dust that had passed through the sunlight nearby. Genuinely, I\u2019m not convinced another phone could have taken that same shot as well. See more Pixel 6 Pro sample images here In many cases, Google\u2019s HDR works brilliantly, adding a level of detail and color accuracy to more challenging conditions. But I\u2019ve also had cases where it just can\u2019t get the color perfectly right, such as with pink clouds at sunset facing away from the sun. Tensor plays a role in ensuring that the shots are processed quickly and accurately without skipping a beat. The shooting experience on Pixel 6 Pro is far more comfortable than on the Pixel 5, primarily due to the new chip. The return of the \u201cVisual Core\u201d on Tensor also means that apps such as Instagram and Snapchat should have significantly better quality shots. The ultrawide camera, meanwhile, feels like a moderate upgrade. While actually a lower resolution than the Pixel 5, shots feel better processed on this hardware, probably thanks to Tensor. Google also brought back a much wider-angle for the selfie camera, boosting it up to 94-degrees. I\u2019m not much of a selfie-taker, but the added width is certainly a welcome addition for even me. The quality of shots for the most part, too, is good. But the more important addition is the telephoto lens, which offers the Pixel 6 Pro a 4x optical zoom and digital zoom up to 20x. The results from the telephoto lens are not nearly as impressive as what Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S21 Ultra pulls off with its 10x lens, but it\u2019s hard to be unhappy with Google\u2019s offering here. Shots at 4x are good and Super Res Zoom ensures that shots at 20x are more than usable. I will say, though, that at night this sensor struggles. It\u2019s not due to the sharpness of photos or a lack of light, it\u2019s strong in both, but because additional sources of light that are out of frame, such as street lights, can mess with the edges of the shot. One odd quirk of the telephoto camera is that it takes a second to switch over. Tapping the 4x zoom setting will set the zoom to that level, but it won\u2019t use the dedicated sensor immediately. Rather, it takes a half-second for the sensor to switch over. This is a minor annoyance at worst, in my view, and something I\u2019d be fine living with. However, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s something Google can easily fix in the future. 1x 2x 4x 20x This telephoto lens really goes a long way in making the Pro\u2019s camera more suited to every sort of shot, and there are some shots I\u2019ve captured with it that I simply wouldn\u2019t have been able to frame otherwise. As usual, features only sweeten the deal Beyond the impressive raw camera quality, it\u2019s Google\u2019s suite of features that set the Pixel 6 capture experience apart from the competition. This includes long-standing features such as Portrait Mode and Night Sight, which work just as well this year as they did every other, except now with sharper details and faster processing. New this time around is \u201cMotion Mode,\u201d which is a new section in the camera app with two features. The first is \u201cAction Pan,\u201d which can capture motion in a shot in some clever ways. \u201cLong Exposure\u201d can also capture light trails in some neat ways. These are features I was only able to do very limited testing of in the past week, but the results are middling in my case. Action Pan is a very clever idea that locks focus on a moving object and shows the motion in the scene around it. Google\u2019s example of a biker is a great one because it allows a decently sized moving subject that\u2019s usually moving pretty quickly through a scene. To get a good result, though, the movement needs to be two-fold. There\u2019s the subject, but also you as the photographer who needs to be moving slightly to ensure the background is properly blurred. Solely from a technical standpoint, it\u2019s incredible that Google can get anything out of these conditions, much more so anything remotely usable. Yet, even at night, I\u2019m pretty impressed by what this feature puts out in the right conditions. A happy little pupper running in your direction is not the right condition. Long Exposure\u2019s usefulness is a bit less obvious at a glance. The idea of this one is to capture motion in a still scene, for example, cars moving on a street, a waterfall, or a fire\u2019s movements. I only had a few brief examples of this but I wasn\u2019t super impressed with the final outcome of any of these. I feel this is in part because this feature is wholly automatic, meaning you can\u2019t adjust the exposure to say, capture another passing car. It really limits the practicality of this option, but I will say that Tensor processes the final shot with astounding speed and the results are usually at least pretty neat looking, even at night. Both of Google\u2019s Motion Modes are technically in beta right now, which is a smart idea. The problem with these features isn\u2019t really their performance, though. The shots themselves can be very good in the right setting, but that\u2019s just the problem. In a big city, Long Exposure has great potential, and Action Pan will be fun in certain settings too. Still, these both, at least to me, feel less practically useful compared to the Pixel\u2019s other features, in the same vein as Astrophotography. Super cool, useful to some people, but forgettable to many others. Another minor addition on the software front is the ability to adjust color temperature in real-time as you shoot the picture. I can\u2019t say this is something I\u2019ve ever really wanted from the Pixel\u2019s camera, but it\u2019s a neat addition nonetheless. That said, I couldn\u2019t find a single scenario over the past week where I actually needed to use it. Finally, there\u2019s Magic Eraser, which might be my favorite feature Google has put out in years. This feature is best thought of as a portable, instant Photoshop for removing unwanted objects from photos. The results here are, for the most part, pretty impressive. Google typically suggests using the feature on pictures of cities where it can remove street lamps and people from the street with ease, and good results. You can always find problems when you look closely enough, but you\u2019d be hard-pressed to manage similar results manually in remotely the same time frame. In realistic cases, like removing a person in the distance, a pet or object in the background, or something along those lines, the results are usually going to be fine. Even in the best scenario, you\u2019re going to be able to tell something changed, but the people you share it with probably won\u2019t notice it, which makes this a fantastic tool for social media, but less so for memories you want to keep for years to come. On a side note, I also found that Magic Eraser was great for removing skin blemishes, though some optimization work is probably needed for this particular use case. \u2026 But how\u2019s the video? Stills, clearly, are still a big strength for Google. However, the area Pixel has always suffered against the iPhone, in particular, is in video quality. This year\u2019s offering does indeed make improvements to video quality, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s quite a silver bullet. The video coming out of the Pixel 6 Pro\u2019s 50MP primary sensor is overall very good, with the Live HDR effect enabled by Tensor really adding better colors to video. This is especially obvious in outdoor settings based on my testing, but it also impacts indoor settings. One of the biggest issues I ran into with video quality was with zoom. The Pixel 6 Pro would not switch to its 4x lens when I zoomed in to that level while actively shooting in a couple of tests, which left shots where the zoom level changed fairly noisy. It did work on most other occasions, though, but it was left with the same quick bump over to 4x from the primary sensor as I saw in photos. Obviously, that\u2019s even less desirable in video. Despite that quirk, I think video quality on the Pixel 6 Pro gives Samsung a run for its money but is still short on what the latest iPhones are capable of. Live HDR, Google\u2019s various stabilization features, and slow-motion/time-lapse features certainly help boost it, but not to the point of holding the crown. Whether it\u2019s because of the raw horsepower of Apple\u2019s chips or the optimization work the company is doing, Apple is just far ahead of Android in this department. However, the Pixel is certainly looking at a close call with the Galaxy S21 Ultra for second place. Tidbits Haptics Vibrations are a minor point for any phone, but they can really enhance or detract from the experience depending on their quality. Google definitely gets it right on the Pixel 6 Pro. The haptic motors are the best the series has had since the Pixel 3 and Pixel 4, which is to say they\u2019re among the best Android has to offer. You won\u2019t get the same precise vibrations that the iPhone series manages from its \u201cHaptic Engine,\u201d but the bumps and buzzes are pleasant extensions of the hardware experience. Abner calls it \u201ccalibrated and forceful precision.\u201d You\u2019ll feel this from the moment you turn on the phone, as Google\u2019s setup experience has a delightful demo of the haptics. Fingerprint Sensor For the first time on a Pixel, Google is using an in-display fingerprint sensor on the Pixel 6 series, and it works just fine. The optical-based sensor is accurate but not super quick. I\u2019ve had very few instances where the sensor failed to recognize my fingerprint, but it\u2019s slower to take the reading compared to what Samsung and OnePlus are currently using and what the capacitive rear sensor was able to put out. I wouldn\u2019t call this a problem, though, as it\u2019s still a far leap over what we saw on earlier versions of this technology, and I\u2019d much rather take it over face unlock as COVID-19 rages on. Google\u2019s official case As mentioned earlier, the Pixel 6 Pro is a phone that demands a case. Google sells one in its store for $29.99, but it\u2019s nothing to write home about. The plastic case fits the Pixel 6 Pro well (not very tight, not very loose) and looks good with the design, but it feels generic. I doubt it would offer strong drop protection, but it does deliver the needed grip. I wish Google had kept its unique fabric cases and left these generic designs to third parties. Or, rather, just make both. Bluetooth performance A problem for some previous Pixel phones was the performance of the Bluetooth radio, and, so far, I\u2019ve been mostly alright with what the Pixel 6 Pro delivers. I had some issues with a pair of Jabra Elite 3 earbuds, but things were business as usual with Pixel Buds A-Series. I also kept a solid connection to my Fossil Gen 6 watch throughout the week. Speakers After the ludicrous display that was the Pixel 5\u2019s speaker situation, I\u2019m happy to report that the Pixel 6 Pro sounds excellent. The bottom-facing driver combined with a real earpiece speaker leads to rich audio quality. It can get a little muddy at higher volumes, but it feels roughly on par with any other standard flagship phone and still a bit behind the Galaxy Z Fold 3, which is what I consider the golden standard \u2013 it\u2019s hard to beat two true stereo drivers. On a related note, call quality was solid. The return of a proper earpiece ensured that audio on my end was clear, and callers seemed pleased with my end through Google Voice calls primarily. Final Thoughts The Pixel 6 Pro is a phone I\u2019d describe as refreshing. For Google, it marks a new chapter in not just the company\u2019s smartphone lineup but also in its hardware ambitions as a whole. The Tensor chip inside is a huge bet for the future, and as far as it looks right now, it seems like the odds are in Google\u2019s favor. More impactful, perhaps, is what this means for customers. The Pixel 6 Pro is an $899 flagship smartphone that really has no significant flaws. There are a couple of minor quirks, sure, but almost everything here is on par with the competition. It has a display nearly as good as Samsung\u2019s, performance as good as OnePlus, a camera that gives Apple a run for its money, and practical software features that outclass just about everyone, all with support longer than any other Android phone. The only thing that really undermines the Pixel 6 Pro is its sibling, the $300 cheaper Pixel 6 . We\u2019ll have more to say on that model soon, but the Pro\u2019s few advantages, such as the telephoto camera, better screen, and additional memory, don\u2019t always feel worth the extra cash. However, I feel confident saying that just about anyone would be happy with the Pixel 6 Pro, something I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever said about a flagship Pixel since the first one. This is the one we\u2019ve all been waiting for. You can buy the Pixel 6 Pro from the Google Store , Verizon , AT&T , T-Mobile , Best Buy , B&H Photo , Amazon , Target , and other major retailers in the United States. Deliveries are set to begin on October 28, but it seems that popularity has left stock hard to find at launch. Your best bet as far as we can see today is B&H , your carrier, or the Google Store\u2019s waitlist . FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

    "full_description": "The new AirPods 3rd Generation ($279) are curious devices. On the one hand, they\u2019re much more impressive than their older siblings thanks to added sensors and spatial audio. But, on the other hand, the bulby part that goes in your ear is much larger than the previous generation, ruling out those with smaller ears for whom the older model fit perfectly. The question becomes: does the redesign giveth more than it teaketh away? The good news is that the engineers nailed the most important bit: they sound excellent, thanks to the larger drivers and extra features packed into their larger body. Not as full as the AirPods Pro ($399), which is to be expected as those are in-ears with silicon tips, and these are just plastic buds resting on your ears. But the 3rd Gen is definitely better than the 2nd Gen (now $219), which lacked bass response. Apple now sells three sets of earbuds: the new AirPods Gen 3, the older AirPods Gen 2 and the more expensive AirPods Pro. Chasing Twisters by Delta Rae poses a real challenge to headphones to reproduce well; it relies on moments of silence, heavy emotion, small details, low bass and clear high frequencies. It starts sparse, builds to a dramatic cacophony and can be ruined by flat or poorly tuned headphones. The new AirPods did well for the most part, nailing the silences, some of the emotion, and the driving beat of the floor toms. But on the second chorus, as the song built, the mid-tones started getting a little muddy and it became difficult to tell the individual instruments apart. It still sounded much, much fuller than on the older AirPods, which sound tinny and cheap in comparison. But while they came impressively close to the experience of the AirPods Pro, they couldn\u2019t quite touch the detail and emotion of their in-ear sibling. On a positive note, I\u2019ve listened to Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s Good 4 You a hundred times on various speakers and headphones, but when listening on the new AirPods for the first time I noticed a mysterious high-pitched instrument in amongst the cymbals on the bridge. I normally wouldn\u2019t expect to pick up new details on ear buds, so that was a pleasant surprise. The new AirPods have a few more tricks, but they\u2019re also a chunkier fit. They also handled My Way by Pvris admirably. It\u2019s an extremely bass heavy song that relies on the bass guitar to be just distorted enough without going over the edge, with the brightness of the hi-hats twinkling in the background. Ear buds shouldn\u2019t be able to make this song sound this good, and yet these ones do. The new AirPods are great for movies too, though spatial audio doesn\u2019t quite have the same impact on these as they do on the AirPods Pro. Spatial is obviously huge for Dolby Atmos movies and shows, with sounds seeming to come from above, below and around, and having the audio stay in the same place while you move your head is trippy and immersive. Part of this improved sound comes down to the adaptive EQ which uses an inward facing microphone to tune the frequencies to match the shape of your ear, which makes a noticeable difference. There\u2019s also an upgrade to how the on-device controls work, moving away from the tap controls (which are easily triggered by adjusting the ear bud) and towards force controls on the stick. This is extremely welcome, because usually true wireless headphones have the least user-friendly controls ever, enough to make one miss the days of wired remotes. Another great addition is that they now have the same accessibility features of the AirPods Pro, including Live Listen, which is wonderful. But, with all those extra features comes added girth, and those with smaller ears, or for whom the existing regular AirPods fit perfectly, will have some issues. I always found the original AirPods fit perfectly, and the new AirPods just felt a touch too big. They\u2019re the same size bulb as the AirPods Pro, but the Pro have the added clutch of the ear canal. Although the left AirPod constantly felt at risk of falling out, it took a surprising amount of effort to get it to actually fall. It was secure while riding for five kilometres on a stationary bike. Making weird faces and eating chewy food is usually enough to make all but the most secure buds fall, but they passed the test. The thing that finally made it fall was the ultimate test: drumming. When drumming you can\u2019t touch the ear bud, you\u2019re (or at least, I\u2019m) making weird faces, and there\u2019s a lot of head movement. In the end, the only negatives are the size and the unfortunate environmental impact of the unrepairable, unrecyclable true wireless style. If you can get past that, and have an appropriately sized ear shell, the 3rd Generation AirPods are a huge improvement over the originals. There\u2019s a reason why AirPods have become so iconic and are the most popular true wireless headphones, and these take that to the next level. The 3rd Generation AirPods are easily the best non-in-ear ear buds I can ever remember hearing. Get news and reviews on technology, gadgets and gaming in our Technology newsletter every Friday.

    "full_description": "We\u2019ve never embraced the open design of Apple's AirPods because the inconsistent fit of these true wireless earphones rarely translated to quality audio performance. That hasn't stopped Apple from sticking to the same design for its third-generation AirPods ($179), albeit with a few tweaks. The earbuds still have some problems with how they fit, but new internal sensors and mics help drive some of the best bass we've heard from this type of design. The latest version of these earphones also feature shorter stems, a MagSafe charging case, and Spatial Audio support. The second-gen AirPods are still available for $129, but we recommend you spring for the new model because of their superior audio performance. That said, the $249 noise-cancelling AirPods Pro still sound more accurate and fit better because their eartips can form a proper seal, earning them our Editors' Choice award. The third-generation AirPods may look similar to the previous model at first glance, but side-by-side, their differences are immediately apparent. Both are open-style earbuds and have a stem-style design, but the stems on the newer AirPods are significantly shorter (1.21 inches vs. 1.59 inches) and better-sculpted for in-ear fit. Internally, the new model has a redesigned driver and even a skin-detect sensor that uses light reflections to determine if they are currently in your ear. An H1 wireless audio chip, the same one found in the second-generation AirPods and the AirPods Pro, also sits in each earphone along with a microphone designed to measure how your ear processes sound. Neither the third- or second-gen models has eartips or earfins to secure their fit and both share the same glossy, almost slippery exterior. A more grip-friendly surface material would have been welcome; it\u2019s easy to lose your handle on the earpieces or the case and send them both flying across the room. The AirPods are just as lightweight as ever at just 0.15 ounces and have a barely-there feeling because of how they sit in your ear. While we can appreciate their understated presence, it makes the earbuds seem far more likely to fall out than if they had eartips that could form an in-canal seal. The fit can vary ear-to-ear, and even in the same ear, because it\u2019s easy to position the earbuds in slightly different directions. This variance can lead to inconsistent stereo imaging, but an on-board measurement mic is supposed to mitigate this effect; we discuss that technology in the Adaptive EQ section. The AirPods get the same IPX4 rating as the AirPods Pro, which means they are capable of withstanding a sweaty workout or light rain but not much beyond that. You can't submerge the earpieces or dunk them for cleaning; a slightly damp cloth is probably the safest bet. The charging case also gets an IPX4 rating, which notable because most true wireless earphones don't get any IP rating. The protection doesn\u2019t apply to the interior of the case though, so make sure you fully dry the earpieces before docking them for charging. The Jabra Elite Active 75t earbuds are a bit more appealing for runners because of their IP57 rating. The AirPods support Bluetooth 5.0 and are compatible with the AAC and SBC Bluetooth codecs, but not AptX. Apple estimates that they will last up to six hours on battery. The case holds about 24 additional hours of juice. Your results will vary with your volume levels, talk time, listening time, and use of Spatial Audio. You can charge the case wirelessly with a MagSafe or Qi-certified charger or via the case's Lightning port. Apple includes a Lightning to USB-C cable in the box. Although the stems of the new AirPods are much smaller, the on-ear controls still work well. They are prone to accidental presses whenever you adjust the in-ear fit, however. One squeeze of the stem produces a clicking sound and controls playback and call management. Double-click to skip to the next track and triple-click to navigate backward. A long press and hold summons Siri manually, but, of course, you can also just say \u201cHey Siri.\u201d These controls are the same for each earbud and work via an indented force sensor that relies on both touch and pressure; while this means you can control the AirPods with gloves on, you may have trouble doing so because of the small size and slipperiness of their material. As is typical for AirPods (except for the AirPods Max headphones), there are no on-ear volume controls. Out of the box, the AirPods are ready to pair automatically with iPhones, iPads, and Macs once you flip open the charging case lid; we immediately got a prompt on our iPhone 13 for pairing when we opened the case the first time. The ability to pair the AirPods without having to go to the Bluetooth menu is always something we appreciate. You can connect them to non-Apple products through the standard Bluetooth pairing process. In testing, however, we found that the automatic pairing across multiple devices can be annoying in certain scenarios. For instance, out of the box, the third-generation AirPods paired with our iMac and iPhone 8 without any input, even though we paired the AirPods with only the iPhone 13 we used for testing. This may be because we previously paired AirPods Pros with the other two devices, but it's still irritating. To prevent this behavior, go into the Bluetooth settings on your phone or computer and deselect the \u201cConnect to this Phone Automatically\u201d option. You have to head over to the Bluetooth menu after pairing to adjust various settings even on your iPhone\u2014this is essentially Apple\u2019s answer to the separate companion apps that accompany most other wireless earbuds. Here, you can enable or disable Automatic Ear detection, enable Spatial Audio; and adjust whether the mic always stays fixed to the left or right AirPod or auto-switches when you are using only one earpiece. You can also toggle the optimized charging mode, in which the AirPods learn from your charging routine and wait until you\u2019re ready to use them to charge beyond 80 percent. The Find My feature also lets you locate lost earbuds; each one shows up on a map and you can even search for left or right individually. One thing missing is an actual EQ rather than Adaptive EQ or presets. The best apps for competing in-ears, like the Jabra Elite 7 Pro , have simple, user-adjustable EQs built-in. Sure, Apple Music lets you choose EQ presets (go to the settings menu to choose from a wide range), but that\u2019s different from a 5-band, user-adjustable presets. There\u2019s no reason why iOS shouldn\u2019t offer that feature and it's a glaring exclusion considering the AirPods' price. At its core, Apple\u2019s Adaptive EQ is an example of existing technology\u2014 digital signal processing (DSP)\u2014renamed to sound like a groundbreaking feature. Without DSP, nearly every pair of wireless in-ears (and over-ears) would distort at higher volumes on tracks with deep bass. That said, DSP is about more than just preventing distortion. Apple and other manufacturers use it to apply an EQ curve to the audio and sculpt headphones' unique sound signatures. Bass response, in particular, requires adjustments to both compensate for perceived lower responses at lower volumes and to prevent distortion at higher volumes. What makes Adaptive EQ unique is a microphone embedded in the AirPods that measures how your ear processes audio. It determines how the placement of the earbud impacts audio performance and then actively adjusts the audio. Because the placement of the earbud and its angle can vary so much, the AirPods use the mics' measurements to generate an EQ curve to balance it out. Earphones with an in-canal seal don\u2019t need to go through this trouble. In other words, while the mic is fancy from a technological standpoint, it's more so an acknowledgment of the glaring issue with an open earbud design. We can't measure the degree to which the mic is actively adjusting the audio, so how well this feature works is a difficult question to answer. In any case, the DSP Apple applies to the signal is a step forward for open earbud designs, regardless of how much of it is a result of the mic measurements. Because of this, the third-generation AirPods benefit from better ear-to-ear balance and audio performance compared with the previous model. We tested the third-generation AirPods' audio quality with Spatial Audio turned off, though we discuss that feature in the next section. Simply, the new AirPods offer a balanced, clear sound with solid anchoring in the lows and definition in the highs. On tracks with intense sub-bass content, like The Knife\u2019s \u201cSilent Shout,\u201d the AirPods deliver some serious low-frequency depth, regardless of volume level. This is a significant development because the second-generation model struggled to reproduce bass depth even at moderate volume levels. At maximum volume levels (and these drivers can get far louder than they need to, or should), there\u2019s no distortion. The in-ear fit can still cause inconsistencies, but the bass response doesn't seem to suffer as a result. In some scenarios, the open design is even beneficial, making the lows can sound bouncier and more natural. See How We Test Headphones See How We Test Headphones Bill Callahan\u2019s \u201cDrover,\u201d a track with far less deep bass in the mix, better reveals the sound signature of the AirPods. The drums on this track sound fantastic through the drivers\u2014full, natural, airy, and without veering into overly thunderous territory. They present Callahan\u2019s baritone vocals with a rich low-mid presence and crisp high-mid definition. Higher frequencies are bright and clear, lending some extra presence to the acoustic strums and higher register percussive hits. On Jay-Z and Kanye West\u2019s \u201cNo Church in the Wild,\u201d the kick drum loop receives ideal high-mid presence, allowing its attack to retain its punch. The vinyl crackle and hiss that are usually relegated to background status take a step forward in the mix, as well\u2014though there\u2019s some sculpting happening in the highs. The sub-bass synth hits that punctuate the beat are delivered with less subwoofer-like depth than we might hear from blatantly bass-forward earphones but are still quite full and deep. The drum loop also gets some added low-frequency thump, while the vocals sound clean, clear, and free of added sibilance. On orchestral tracks, like John Adams\u2019 \"The Chairman Dances\" and the opening scene from The Gospel According to the Other Mary , we noted something I'd never imagine to hear from an earbud that doesn\u2019t seal off the ear canal: a nearly accurate sound signature. Sure, there\u2019s still potential for a mismatched in-ear balance, but the sound has body and even some spatial depth. The lower-register instrumentation sounds fantastic, too. Spatial Audio is a feature that can make audio sound bigger and more directional through the AirPods. It has two modes: Fixed and Head Tracked. Fixed Spatial Audio adds a sense of roominess to the mix with an effect similar to the simulated surround features used in many gaming headsets. Head Tracked Spatial Audio uses motion sensors in the AirPods to detect how you move your head and then adjusts the perceived location of the sound accordingly. Both forms of Spatial Audio provide fun effects, but most music is not recorded in such a way to take advantage of them. This can sometimes harm the sound balance, so you should probably disable the features when listening to stereo mixes. As for music that is mixed with Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos (a similar audio processing system), that's a different story. Apple suggests checking out James Blake\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m So Blessed You\u2019re Mine\u201d and a scene from Greyhound to truly experience Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos mixing at their finest. These samples certainly have a spatial feel, but they also sound good without the effect. At worst, the feature is harmless and easily turned off, and at best, the effect is kind of cool. But we have yet to find a better use for Spatial Audio than slowly spinning around in a chair so that it sounds like the music is moving around our heads, dizziness aside. The regular mics on the AirPods offer strong intelligibility. We could understand every word we recorded when we tested them using the Voice Memos app on an iPhone 8. Though Bluetooth audio artifacts were still audible in the signal, the clarity was top-notch. The mic also handled windy outdoor scenarios fairly well\u2014we could still hear wind in the recordings, but it didn\u2019t impact vocal intelligibility. Siri, which is accessible simply by speaking to Siri through the AirPods, had no problems understanding our voice commands. If you are a fan of asking for a weather report or playing a song relatively quickly after saying \u201cHey Siri,\u201d this feature won't disappoint. If you don\u2019t like the idea of Siri always listening, you can easily turn this feature off in the Siri settings menu; just look for the Listen for 'Hey Siri' option. You can now choose from three in-ear AirPods models , with prices ranging between $130 and $250. The $180 third-gen AirPods are a serious upgrade over the still-available second-gen AirPods; they fit better and offer some potentially useful audio processing features. The only compelling reason to go with the second-generation AirPods is to save money, but if that\u2019s your goal, you could save even more and get a better audio experience from a non-Apple pair of earphones, such as the $80 Anker Soundcore Life P3 . You sacrifice the seamless integration between AirPods and iOS, but if audio and active noise cancellation (ANC) is a priority, it\u2019s a worthwhile trade-off. The Editors' Choice-winning and ANC-enabled AirPods Pro bests the third-generation AirPods at ear-to-ear consistency because of their in-canal fit, something we can't emphasize enough. The Pro model also enables a more realistic and transparent listening experience, even if it is still a bit sculpted. Some people really like boosted bass, however, and the new AirPods deliver deeper, fuller bass response than the AirPods Pro. Discounting in-ear fit, it's a matter of taste. Other similarly priced true wireless options that seal off the ear canal also compete (and in some cases surpass) the audio quality of the third-generation AirPods. Some even offer customizable EQs via companion apps and boast better water resistance. The $199 Jabra Elite 7 Pro earphones or the $180 Sennheiser CX Plus True Wireless earbuds are both excellent options, for example. The third-generation AirPods are a notable improvement over the previous two models, especially in terms of audio quality. Seamless integration with iOS devices, the inclusion of a MagSafe-compatible charging case, and a water-resistant build earn them the highest rating we\u2019ve ever given to in-ears that don\u2019t seal off the ear canal. However, the lack of true, user-adjustable EQ is disappointing at this price. And Spatial Audio is fun, but more or less a gimmick at this point. We still recommend the AirPods Pro for Apple users who care most about audio quality. Everyone else should consider the less expensive or similarly priced alternatives we highlight above for their superior combination of fit, function, and high-fidelity",

    "full_description": "Apple now offers three different sets of AirPods: the second-generation AirPods , the new, third-generation AirPods , and the AirPods Pro . They all look a bit different, sound a bit different, and offer slightly different features. But which of these true wireless earbuds is best for you? Here's how each model stacks up. Before we go through their differences, let\u2019s look at what these in-ears have in common. All of the current AirPods use the Apple H1 wireless audio chip, which allows for seamless pairing and iOS integration. All three earbuds also offer the option for hands-free Siri voice controls. And all three models sport Apple's distinctive glossy white exterior finish. The AirPods Pro remain the most expensive of the three earbuds at $249. Because the third-generation AirPods ($179) joined, rather than replaced, the second-generation model in the lineup, the latter are now available at a discount ($129). Winner: Winner: Second-Gen AirPods All three AirPods use an earbud-and-stem design, though the third-gen AirPods and AirPods Pro both have noticeably shorter stems than the second-gen AirPods. The second- and third-generation AirPods have an open and nonintrusive design, which means they don't create a seal with your ear canal. The open design means they are prone to inconsistent sound imaging because the earphones may not always sit in your ears at the same angle. The third-generation AirPods do have a mic that measures how your ear processes audio to mitigate some of the inherent issues of their open design, but the technology is still not as effective as physical eartips. The AirPods Pro use silicone eartips to seal off the ear canal and ensure a more consistent fit. Beyond the earpiece design, the charging cases for the third-gen AirPods and the AirPods Pro look pretty similar: rounded rectangles with flip-top lids along the longest length and external status LEDs. The second-generation AirPods use a more square-shaped case with a lid on its shortest length and an interior status LED. Winner: Winner: AirPods Pro Like most capacitive touch panels, the controls on the second-generation AirPods work via a tap. The Pro model and third-gen AirPods, meanwhile, use a force sensor panel that responds to both touch and pressure. The force sensor panels are easier to operate than the simple capacitive panels on the second-gen model, but they are still just as easy to accidentally trigger when adjusting the fit of the earphones. This problem affects the third-generation AirPods more than the snug-fitting AirPods Pro, however. Winner: Winner: Tie (Third-Gen AirPods and AirPods Pro) Because the AirPods Pro are the only earbuds in this lineup that can create an in-canal seal, they offer the best ear-to-ear balance. The AirPods Pro also drive the most accurate audio of the three, though none deliver anything close to a transparent sound signature. If you can get consistent placement, the third-generation AirPods offer the richest, roundest-sounding bass response of the three models. Which sound signature you prefer is a matter of preference. See How We Test Headphones See How We Test Headphones The second-gen AirPods can also deliver solid bass depth, but only at higher volumes. Because they are the worst-fitting pair of the three, these models can suffer from bass response issues. Winner: Winner: Tie (Third-Gen AirPods and AirPods Pro) The new third-generation AirPods support Spatial Audio, a feature previously only available with the AirPods Pro and the over-ear, ultra-expensive AirPods Max . Spatial Audio produces a simulated surround sound that can make what you're listening to sound bigger and more directional, especially in the Head Tracking mode. With this setting enabled, the position of audio between the two earphones changes as you move your head; it sounds as if what you're listening to stays in the same location in the room regardless of your head position. The best way to experience the effect is to listen to the audio move around you as you spin around in an office chair. Spatial Audio's Fixed mode enables complex reverb and EQ algorithms that can create an intriguing sound. The feature works best when you use it with tracks that are specifically tuned with Spatial Audio in mind but otherwise may ruin the mix. Winner: Winner: Tie (Third-Gen AirPods and AirPods Pro) The third-gen AirPods lead the three models in terms of battery life, but none is particularly impressive. The third-generation AirPods can last up to six hours on a charge, while their case carries another 24 hours. The AirPods Pro last noticeably shorter (four and a half hours) and their case offers an additional 19 hours' worth of charge. The second-gen AirPods last five hours on a charge; their case holds 19 hours of battery, too. Your experience with each model's battery life will vary, of course, based on how you use your earbuds. Winner: Winner: Third-Gen AirPods The cases for both the AirPods Pro and third-generation AirPods support MagSafe charging, Apple\u2019s version of wireless charging that uses magnets to ensure proper placement on chargers. It eliminates the frustration of having to set the charging case down just so as to align with Qi-enabled charging sensors, but the cases are still compatible with that technology. The older, second-generation AirPods ship with a case that doesn\u2019t charge wirelessly, but you can purchase one that does for $79. Winner: Winner: Tie (Third-Gen AirPods and AirPods Pro) Ingress protection (IP) ratings tell us how well a product can withstand exposure to water and sweat. The IPX4 rating of the third-generation AirPods and AirPods Pro is modest. Both earbuds can handle minor splashes and should be fine to wear during sweaty workouts or in light rain. However, they won't survive if you submerge them or place them under a running faucet. The charging case for the third-gen AirPods also carries an IPX4 rating, but only for the outside; you shouldn't get the inside of the case wet or charge the new AirPods when they are wet. The second-generation AirPods have no water resistance. IPX7-rated earphones, like many workout-focused models , are completely waterproof, while IPX5 and IPX6 models handle a rinse in the sink and heavy rain just fine. The Jabra Elite 7 Pro earbuds, for example, have an IP57 rating. Winner: Winner: Third-Gen AirPods If active noise cancellation (ANC) is a top priority, the AirPods Pro are your only option on this list. The AirPods Pro floored us when they launched\u2014we didn't expect in-ears to deliver quality ANC at any price, much less for $250. Since their 2019 release, however, the rest of the field has caught up with and even surpassed them in some cases. For instance, the Editors' Choice-winning Sony WF-1000XM4 ($279.99) earbuds offer the best ANC we\u2019ve tested in any in-ear or over-ear pair. Other ANC-enabled true wireless earphones even offer companion apps with adjustable ANC settings; the AirPods Pro don't. Many less expensive in-ears offer ANC, too; the Anker Soundcore Life P3 earbuds, for example, are an Editors' Choice pick that cost only $79.99. Winner: Winner: AirPods Pro The third-generation AirPods and the AirPods Pro both use dual beamforming, inward-facing mics to deliver above-average intelligibility. The second-gen AirPods also use a dual-mic array, but it doesn't face inward or sound quite as clear. Winner: Winner: Tie (Third-Gen AirPods and AirPods Pro) We don't recommend that you purchase the second-generation AirPods\u2014they're inferior to the new, third-gen AirPods, which offer better sound, an improved fit, MagSafe charging, and Spatial Audio. The newer AirPods cost $50 more but are worth the extra cost. If you are interested in the second-generation AirPods solely because of their low price, many more affordable true wireless earphones offer better sound, fit, water-resistance ratings, and even ANC. Nearly all of them seal off the ear canal, too. To choose between the third-generation AirPods and the AirPods Pro, you must decide which features you care about most. The AirPods Pro fit better, drive more accurate sound, and include ANC. The third-generation AirPods are less expensive, offer a more bass-friendly sound signature, last longer on battery, and come with a more rugged case. The AirPods Pro score higher in our review because we prefer their in-ear fit and they are more competitive with similarly-priced earbuds. Winner: Winner: AirPods Pro",

    "content": "It\u2019s no secret that Zwift is the global leader in indoor cycling. The seven-year-old company has already garnered millions of users and interest from professional cycling teams, academies, and races around the world. Having been in the spotlight since its adolescence, Zwift is one of first indoor cycling apps that got people excited by the best turbo trainers and spurred a world of interest in virtual cycling.While Zwift is the most popular indoor cycling app in the world, it is not the only one. Believe it or not, there are aspects of Zwift that some people do not enjoy. Whether it\u2019s the gamified experience or the pixelated avatars, there are many cyclists who don\u2019t prefer Zwift. As advancements in indoor cycling technology continue at an all-time high, the birth of other indoor training apps has followed. You may recognise the apps such as Rouvy, TrainerRoad, and Wahoo Systm, but there are many more.We've tried almost every indoor cycling app available, and while we're all fans of Zwift here at Cyclingnews, we're by no means exclusive Zwifters. Others have many benefits too, so here are our favourite Zwift alternatives. Wahoo Systm (Image credit: Wahoo) Price: $14.99/monthFeatures: Scientifically-procured workouts and training plans tailored to your unique physiology; plus all-round fitness training sessions, humorous in-app text, and real-life race videosPlatform: Mac, Windows, iOS, Android For comparison\u2019s sake, here is Zwift: Price: $14.99/monthFeatures: Organised and custom races, workouts, group rides, and solo exploring on a variety of virtual and real-life modelled maps, with thousands of riders as your companionPlatform: Mac, Windows, iOS, Apple TV, Android Wahoo recently announced the rebranding of Wahoo Suf to Wahoo Systm, an all-encompassing training app that seeks to help you reach your cycling goals. Unlike Zwift \u2013 which has just cycling and running \u2013 Wahoo Systm has a multiple-faceted approach to training and recovery, and includes guided sessions such as mental training, yoga, strength training, and meditation in addition to cycling.Wahoo Systm also uses the patented 4DP test to evaluate your current fitness, in a more thorough way than the traditional 20-minute FTP test or ramp test. The Sufferfest workouts are a truly unique experiencing, combining real-life race videos, on-screen text, and motivating music to help you reach your power targets. However, there are no virtual worlds in Wahoo Systm, and you won\u2019t be able to ride with friends like you can on Zwift.There is also no \u2018gaming\u2019 feel to Systm, such as experience points, levelling up, or having a customisable avatar. Some users will appreciate this, while others won\u2019t. Overall, Wahoo Systm is a much more focused training app than Zwift, one that takes away the distractions and helps you get the most out of yourself. Wahoo Systm promises to help you get the most out of your training, and make you fitter and faster than ever with its customised training sessions and plans. Wahoo Systm helps you maximise limited training hours, and get the most out of training and recovery in a single app. Peloton (Image credit: Peloton ) Price: $14.99/monthFeatures: Instructor-led spin classes, yoga, strength training, HIIT sessions, stretching, running, and meditation in a single appPlatform: iOS, Android The most popular indoor cycling app in the world is not Zwift \u2013 it's Peloton. You\u2019ve certainly heard of the brand before, but if you\u2019re a Zwifter, you\u2019ve probably never tried Peloton, or vice versa. The apps target very different user bases, with Zwift going after more traditional road cyclists, and Peloton geared towards spin class enthusiasts. Here\u2019s what Peloton has to offer.Peloton Digital \u2013 Peloton\u2019s training app \u2013 includes everything from live, instructor-led spin classes to guided strength training sessions. There are yoga classes, interval training workouts, stretching, running, and meditation classes included in the monthly subscription, which costs the same as Zwift at $14.99 per month.Peloton Digital is a lot like Wahoo Systm because it focuses on all-around fitness, but what you see during a ride will be vastly different. Unlike Wahoo Systm, Peloton doesn\u2019t have an ERG mode workout graph for power and heart rate, or real-life race videos in the background. Instead, Peloton is known for its instructor-led spin classes which are live throughout the day, but also available 24/7 through the Peloton archive. With upbeat music playing in the background, Peloton\u2019s professional instructors will help you stay focused and full of energy throughout your spin session. This is a far cry from more traditional cycling apps that are mostly focused on either ERG mode training or virtual cycling.As opposed to Zwift which is all about social connection and competition by riding with or against other avatars, Peloton is focused on peer-based motivation, putting you into a live workout with other users around the world, challenging and helping you all get the most out of yourselves during a tough spin session. Peloton also has a more holistic approach to training within its app, with stretching and recovery sessions included. But unlike Zwift, the actual rides will be extremely different, with only the instructor and your own metrics to look at. There are no roads to ride on or mountains to climb, you\u2019ll just have to use your imagination. Is Peloton worth it?Best smart bikes: Dedicated smart turbo trainer bikes that are more than your typical home exercise bike TrainerRoad (Image credit: Courtesy TrainerRoad) Price: $19.95/monthFeatures: No-nonsense app designed to make you a faster cyclistPlatform: Mac, Windows, iOS, Android One of the most popular training apps around, TrainerRoad has a massive following from both its training app and \u201cAsk a Cycling Coach\u201d podcast. Tens of thousands of subscribers regularly share their FTP improvements on social media, saying how TrainerRoad helped them get fitter and faster.TrainerRoad has one of the simplest and barest displays out of any cycling training app. All you\u2019ll see is an ERG mode workout graphing your planned and completed power output, as well as some of your other metrics such as heart rate and cadence. A few on-screen instructions will help you stay focused on the effort at hand, but that\u2019s about it. There are no virtual worlds, and the only social connection comes if you choose to ride a group workout with friends, there are no videos to watch or mountains to climb. You don\u2019t get an avatar or any levelling-up bonuses, and there are no races to compete in either. TrainerRoad is all about you and making you faster.Like Wahoo Systm, TrainerRoad is an individually focused app designed to make you a faster cyclist. However, TrainerRoad is even more one-dimensional as the app doesn\u2019t include any other types of sessions such as strength training or mental training. Truthfully said, TrainerRoad is not a fun training app; but it is effective. It uses machine learning to calculate how well you followed a workout, and if you nailed it, it'll level you up. If you failed it, it'll give you a more achievable workout next time round, so that you can continue completing workouts that are hard enough to push you, but not too hard that you fail. If you want to become a faster cyclist \u2013 without the need for entertainment, social connection, or other potential distractions \u2013 TrainerRoad is the app for you. Zwift vs TrainerRoad: An indoor cycling head-to-head Rouvy (Image credit: Rouvy) Price: $10/monthFeatures: Real-life cycling footage, organized racing, and structured and custom workoutsPlatform: Windows, iOS, Apple TV, Android Rouvy offers one of the most immersive virtual cycling experiences of any training app, dropping you into the \u2018real world\u2019 from your own pain cave. The platform has even hosted some virtual National Championship races in Europe, and is always in the conversation when talking about the next big thing in indoor cycling. With over 4000 structured workouts, real-life riding footage, racing, and a custom workout builder, Rouvy might offer the most \u2018bang for your buck\u2019 out of any training app, as it costs just $10 per month.Combining the virtual world with reality, Rouvy puts you onto real-life roads all around the world, taken from the GoPro of a real-life rider. Rouvy then matches your smart trainer of the gradient, and it feels like you\u2019re actually riding up the Stelvio. Few other training apps \u2013 if any \u2013 can match the real-life riding experience of Rouvy. And with so many workouts to choose from, you won\u2019t be struggling to increase your fitness using this app.Perhaps the biggest downside of Rouvy is its outdated racing system in which drafting doesn\u2019t really exist. Every race turs into an individual time trial, so it\u2019s not much of a race at all. Rouvy also lacks the gamified experience of other apps like Zwift, but many users will prefer the real-life feel anyway. Overall, Rouvy is an incredibly unique training app that creates an augmented reality experience unlike any other \u2013 it\u2019s definitely one to try. Zwift vs Rouvy: Which is better? RGT Cycling (Image credit: RGT Cycling) Price: Free (Premium: $14.99/month)Features: Mix of virtual and reality, the ability to upload custom virtual courses, and a unique physics model and racing experiencePlatform: iOS, Apple TV, Android One of the few free training apps is RGT Cycling, a unique app with a whole new level of user input and customisation that has become the favourite of many. Called Road Grand Tours, RGT Cycling is like other training apps in that it has a few virtual roads to ride on, and a massive library of workouts to choose from. The virtual routes include rides up the Stelvio, and the city circuit of the most recent Road World Championships in Leuven, Belgium.RGT Cycling has races on offer every day of the week, and a unique physics model that includes a simulation of braking, drafting, and cornering. No other training apps have these features, which helps RGT Cycling stand out. The app is constantly updated using feedback from its public forums and Discord chats, and an ever-improving physics model has convinced many riders to stay.Perhaps the most unique feature of RGT Cycling is its \u2018Magic Roads.\u2019 These are virtual roads created for you when you send a GPX file to RGT Cycling, and it converts it to a virtual road in less than 24 hours. This is a great tool for entertainment and exploration, but can also be an amazing way to virtually ride somewhere in the world that you\u2019ve never been. You can even ride a stage of the Tour de France, preview the National Championships course, or upload the GPX of your target event and familiarise yourself with every climb, descent and turn. Magic Roads are an amazing feature for pre-riding and course reconnaissance, and one that has even been utilised by professional teams under travel restrictions. RGT vs Zwift: Which platform is more realistic? BKool (Image credit: Courtesy) Price: $10/monthFeatures: Immersive indoor training including workouts, real-world routes, customisable avatars, and morePlatform: Mac, Windows, iOS, Apple TV, Android BKool attempts to blur the virtual with reality, creating a realistic user experience for indoor cycling. One of the most underrated training apps available, BKool shares many features with other indoor cycling apps, such as the ability to upload your own virtual routes. There are hundreds of workouts to choose from and plenty of user customisation such as choosing your own kits and bikes. You\u2019ll even earn experience points for completing miles, just like you would in Zwift.One of the best features of BKool is its massive variety of routes to choose from, including professional racecourses and realistic city rides. You can head into the Ardennes for a tough training session or pedal around London or Sydney on one of BKool\u2019s virtual routes. Available on all the usual platforms, BKool costs $10 per month and is one of the most valuable apps out there. How to choose a Zwift alternative Virtual vs reality In all the above training apps, some tend towards the virtual world while others tend towards reality. Apps like Zwift and RGT Cycling are more based in the former, while Rouvy and Peloton are much more real. Which do you prefer? Do you want to simulate outdoor riding, or play a cycling game with power-ups, experience points, and customisable avatars? The gamified apps add a whole new level to the complexity of indoor cycling which can help or hinder. It\u2019s a steep learning curve to understanding the physics, timing, and reactivity in the game, but once you get the hang of it, it can be a lot more fun than virtually pedalling up an Italian hill. Training vs racing What is more important to you: individual training, or group rides and racing?Your answer will tell you a lot about what app(s) you will prefer, whether it\u2019s TrainerRoad or Zwift. To maximise your indoor cycling experience and not waste a single pedal stroke, individually focused apps such as Wahoo Systm and TrainerRoad are the best options. But if you want to ride in groups, challenge friends on KOMs or in races, and be surrounded by other people (even if it\u2019s just in a virtual world), then you need a connected and sociable app like Zwift or RGT Cycling. These indoor cycling apps help you connect with others, explore virtual worlds together, and challenge each other on mountain tops or in the sprint on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. Social or solo riding Social connection is a human need and one that is fully stressed in some indoor cycling apps, and almost ignored in others. The hermit-like nature of apps TrainerRoad or Wahoo Systm can be extremely off-putting to some riders. Complete the workouts and you\u2019ll certainly get faster and maximise the efficiency of your training, but at what cost? On Zwift or RGT Cycling, you\u2019ll be able to ride with others and race against strangers on virtual roads around the world. The training won\u2019t be as specific or precise, but I can almost guarantee that you\u2019ll have a lot more fun, which could lead you to doing it more (if actually at all), which for many, will also yield greater results.",

Often, chemical defenses ensure that the plants are inedible, or even toxic, and as a result insects and other hungry animals steer clear of them. A new study has shown, for the first time, that the degradation of plants' defense substances by insects' digestive enzymes can influence the insects' preference for certain food plants. Researchers at the University of M\u00fcnster, the University of Bern (Switzerland) and the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena investigated this phenomenon in the larvae of cockchafers (Melolontha melolontha) and the plant they feed on, dandelion (Taraxacum officinale). In tackling the enemies that feed on it, the plant organism often uses a chemical trick: it binds a sugar component to the antigen and thus deactivates it. As a result, the substance is prevented from damaging the plant itself. Only when someone nibbles at the plant is the sugar component removed. The result is that the compound becomes toxic or deters the attacker. \"Strangely enough, during digestion some insects themselves remove the sugar component in the plant defense compound,\" says biologist Dr. Meret Huber from M\u00fcnster University. \"It is not yet known precisely,\" she adds, \"what consequences this has for the insects, and especially for their behavior.\" One example of a defense compound containing sugar is a substance called taraxinic acid \u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl ester (TA-G), which dandelions accumulate in their roots in particularly high concentrations. TA-G is an important defense compound in dandelions, deterring the larva of the cockchafer from eating. The team led by Dr. Meret Huber and Prof. Matthais Erb (University of Bern) demonstrated that the pH conditions in the cockchafer's gut inhibit the activity of dandelion enzymes which would otherwise remove the sugar from TA-G. Instead, the cockchafer larva removes the sugar itself, with the aid of an enzyme from the gut that belongs to the class of so-called beta-glucosidases (sugar-splitting enzymes). By using biotechnological methods to simultaneously manipulate the production of TA-G and the presence of the insect enzyme, the researchers showed that the insect glucosidase promotes the growth of the larva on dandelion plants containing TA-G. At the same time, however, the separation of the sugar from TA-G also leads to dandelion plants containing TA-G being shunned. \"This means that, for the first time, we were able to demonstrate that the metabolization of plants' defense substances by the digestive enzymes of insects changes the choice of food plant,\" says Meret Huber. \"This finding is important, because the choice of host plant plays a key role in the distribution of herbivore insects and, as a result, has a strong influence on the damage caused.\" Why the separation of sugar increases growth in the cockchafer larva\u2014while simultaneously deterring the larva\u2014is one of the as yet unanswered questions. Possibly this shunning behavior on the part of the larva helps in finding the side roots of the plant\u2014which have a lower TA-G concentration but a higher nutritional content than the main roots. For the purpose of their studies the researchers used different methods of chemical analysis and biotechnology. They also carried out so-called bio-essays to study the effects of TA-G on the choice of food plant by the larvae. The results are intended to help in improving our understanding of the interactions between plants and their consumers. Future studies in various systems might make it possible to develop medicines or pesticides which are activated only in the presence of certain conditions specific to species or environments. The research was published in eLife . Explore further",

    "full_description": "Nations are edging toward a deal that could create a global carbon market when they meet in Scotland for COP26 climate talks in about a week, after Brazil signaled it's willing to compromise. Brazil softened its stance on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which aims to create a framework for countries and companies to meet their climate goals by trading carbon credits , according to people familiar with the issue, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. The South American nation has a lot of leverage because the Amazon rainforest\u2014one of the biggest carbon sinks in the world\u2014would generate a large amount of credits in any global offsets market overseen by the United Nations. Brazil's willingness to be more flexible is a change after its reluctance to compromise with the European Union at the 2019 Madrid talks led to a deadlock in the negotiations. The new tone comes as businesses have put pressure on President Jair Bolsonaro to resolve the Article 6 debate. Around 100 chief executive officers of large companies recently signed a letter urging him to clarify Brazil's stance on major issues to be discussed at COP26. A final decision will only be reached in Glasgow and many hours of negotiations lie ahead. Striking a deal on the rules for a carbon market would be a major win for the summit, given that it looks increasingly unlikely the U.K. hosts will get the global commitment on phasing out coal they seek and some developing nations have been reluctant to raise their emissions-reduction targets without more financial support from rich countries . \"In all conversations with other delegations, we have clearly signaled that we are more flexible to make the agreement viable,\" Leonardo Cleaver de Athayde, Brazil's chief negotiator at COP26, said in an interview published in the Valor Economico newspaper on Oct. 21. Brazil's environment and foreign affairs ministries didn't immediately respond to questions. The U.K.'s COP unit declined to comment. The Glasgow gathering has been billed as a make-or-break summit to curb global warming, with the U.K. pushing hard for world leaders to raise their climate ambitions. COP26 President Alok Sharma has called on countries to keep alive the prospects of containing the global rise in temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. An agreement on Article 6 would help countries achieve that goal. One of the main sticking points is whether to allow the use of credits generated under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Brazil was one the top countries for emissions-reduction projects under the defunct Clean Development Mechanism, or CDM, and has in the past argued that all those credits should be allowed to make up for pollution cuts after 2020. But Brazil is now willing to find a compromise, said the people. Options on the table include allowing countries to use some credits created under the CDM to meet their earliest climate pledges, called Nationally Determined Contributions. Setting a cutoff date and limits on volumes of such credits could also be part of a potential solution, according to a U.N. document circulated among negotiators earlier this week. The paper was written by the chair of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, and outlines possibles scenarios for a deal on Article 6. Another stumbling block has been disputes over potential double counting. In 2019, the EU said Brazil's plan would allow emissions savings to be counted twice. Brazil has long denied this, though it's now more willing to accept a middle-ground solution, the people said. That could include accepting the concept of double counting only for actions clearly stated in a country's NDC, or providing more time for countries to adapt by creating a period in which they would be exempt from such accounting rules, according to the SBSTA report. Proposed dates being considered include 2025 and 2030, according to the report dated Oct. 18. Still, it's likely that the EU will want more concessions. The bloc has repeatedly said that any agreement on Article 6 would have to guarantee its environmental integrity, and stressed that a bad deal would be worse than having no deal at all.

A Head Key provides access to one's inner self, and an Identity Key allows you to change your appearance. Enlarge / Bode and Abby (Leishe Meyboom) discover a tiny key that fits into a dollhouse version of Key House. Netflix Unfortunately, there's an evil entity who goes by the name of Dodge (Laysla De Oliveira) who desperately wants one key in particular\u2014the mysterious Omega Key\u2014and will do pretty much anything to get it. Over the course of the first season, we learned why family patriarch Rendell Locke (Bill Heck) moved far away from his ancestral home: there was a high school tragedy that killed two of his friends. It wasn't an \"accidental drowning\" that killed them, as local lore held, but Dodge's possession of Rendell's best friend Lucas (Felix Mallard). Rendell and his surviving friends eventually imprisoned Dodge in the Well House\u2014until Ellie (Sherri Saum), in a weak moment, tried to bring Lucas, her high school sweetheart, back with the Echo Key and brought back Dodge instead. Advertisement Still, Rendell's kids proved to be a formidable match against Dodge's many machinations. And they thought they had successfully tossed Dodge back into the void behind the Black Door and locked it behind them. But above all else, Dodge is a trickster. Dodge used the Identity Key to make Ellie look like Dodge. So it's poor Ellie who finds herself trapped in the void, while Dodge has taken on the identity of high school nerd Gabe (Griffin Gluck), Scot's (Petrice Jones) rival for Kinsey's affections. Also, the academy's resident Mean Girl, Eden (Hallea Jones), is now possessed by a different demon who escaped from behind the black door, so Gabe/Dodge has a secret accomplice. Enlarge / Duncan Locke (Aaron Ashmore) can't remember the magical keys he used as a child. Netflix The first season's 10 episodes covered most of the main narrative arc in the comics but left out a lot of the background lore about where the keys came from, who made them, and who (or what) Dodge really is. Those questions are at least partially answered over the course of S2, which includes flashbacks to the American Revolutionary War and the conflict between the Locke family and a British general named Frederick Gideon (Kevin Durand). (The flashback material is partially drawn from Clockworks and will also likely feature heavily in the first arc of World War Key , a forthcoming new Locke and Key comic book series that will serve as both a prequel and sequel to the original run, according to Hill.) As S2 opens, life for the Locke family seems stable. Tyler is dating Jackie (Genevieve Kang), Kinsey is dating Gabe, and Bode has a new BFF, Abby (Leishe Bennett). Abby's father, Josh (Brendan Himes), is the new history teacher at Matheson Academy, and as a recent widower, he and the Locke matriarch, Nina (Darby Stanchfield), forge a tenuous romantic connection. Josh's ancestors also have a long history in Matheson, so the two might have more in common than they realize. Advertisement Enlarge / Gabe (Griffin Gluck), another incarnation of the demon Dodge, and a possessed Eden (Hallea Jones) try to forge a new magical key. Netflix But all is not sunshine and roses. Tyler and Jackie are both about to turn 18 and \"age out\" of the magic, prompting a frantic search for the Memory Key that Rendell and his squad (the \"Keepers of the Keys\") forged to ensure they wouldn't forget. That involves restoring their uncle Duncan's (Aaron Ashmore) childhood memories, which turns out to have unforeseen consequences. Meanwhile, Gabe/Dodge is conspiring to forge a new key for whatever nefarious plot they're cooking up. And demonic Eden is proving to be overly impulsive and more of a liability than Gabe/Dodge realized.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Businesses large and small are wrestling with the workforce shortage in the U.S. Job openings are at almost 11 million according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of July 2021. [1] As small businesses look to fill their positions, they are searching for ways to improve their appeal. Key considerations include policy, incentives, and technology enhancements. T-MOBILE The pandemic contributed a labor shortage that has thrust organizations into a position to rethink their operations\u2014from recruiting strategies to workflow to culture. Workers are leaving their jobs, holding out for higher wages, better work-life balance, and/or greater workplace flexibility. While some SMBs may not have the resources to compete with larger enterprises in terms of offering benefits like paying college tuition, there are several ways they can adapt their practices to expand their talent pool and entice prospective employees. [2] SMBs may have an advantage over larger enterprises in hiring by incorporating the principle of flexibility into their business practices. This could involve expanding their hiring policies and enabling technologies that facilitate remote and hybrid work models or offering incentives like skill-specific online training. In addition to attracting and retaining employees, remote work offers higher productivity and reduced overhead costs. According to a survey of more than 800 employees, 94% said productivity was actually the same or higher than it was during the pandemic, even with a significant portion of their staff working remotely. [3] Some businesses are leaning into the positive impact of remote work. Workers have options, and they\u2019re choosing flexibility There are plenty of reasons why remote or flexible work has become a dealmaker to many. Reduced time commuting means more time to take care of personal lives\u2014or even get more work done. People have realized that meeting with co-workers or customers via a wide variety of conferencing services can be as effective as meeting in person\u2014with less time needed to physically travel to and from a meeting. Less time in the car also means decreasing traffic congestion and carbon production\u2014a positive impact on the environment. How to catch your next rising star While you've likely faced challenges in retaining or hiring employees for your small business during the pandemic, there are several tactics you can deploy to make your company desirable to flexibility-seeking rock stars. Take advantage of the quitters: Data shows that 40% of employees from larger corporations who have been asked to return into the office would rather quit to achieve flexibility. This presents an enormous opportunity for SMBs. Get the word out that your business is looking for talent and publicize your flexibility on location, via LinkedIn, or through your recruiter. Go digital: Many American workers prefer a hybrid work model and would like to work for businesses that offer options like job autonomy and resources that support positive mental health. [4] With the right investments to accelerate the adoption of collaborative tools , SMBs can better compete for talent with larger enterprises by adapting their workflow processes and business model to be remote work-friendly. The result: an expanded talent pool and a greater ability to tap into a more geographically distributed workforce. Assess remote work vs. in-person work needs: Conduct a granular analysis of work that can be done remotely by focusing on the tasks involved rather than entire jobs. Determine if the majority of tasks for a position are best accomplished in an office or store, or if they can be accomplished virtually. And if it makes sense, create a new remote or hybrid position to attract more talent. According to one survey assessing remote work and productivity, about 20% to 25% of the workforce could work from home between three to five days a week. [5] Adjust recruiting strategies: Focus on the skills you need, not just academic degrees. And then take advantage of the fact that, depending on the position, your employees can literally work from anywhere. This increases your available talent pool to the entire country or even globally if needed and can be a huge benefit for a small business. Provide wireless connectivity perks at home: Let your prospective talent know that you will provide them with their own secure, home office internet to conduct business so they don\u2019t have to compete with others in the house\u2014or the neighborhood\u2014for bandwidth. Not only does this benefit your employee, your business will benefit from secure connections as well. Embrace online training tools: With more employees working from different locations, it may be time to reinvent your training and culture-building programs by conducting them online. Showcase your company\u2019s ability to keep your employees efficiently trained and current through your remote work-friendly tools and processes. Opportunity is there for SMBs that embrace flexibility When it comes to finding talent, successfully negotiating the logistics of flexible work is important for SMBs as they look to compete in a post-pandemic economy and an increasingly mobile environment. Recognizing the needs of your changing workforce and implementing the right tools to support a new environment could make the difference in how well you stack up to your competitors in the future.

    "full_description": "Jaeger-LeCoultre uses the reverse dial side of its swiveling Reverso case as a canvas to reproduce paintings in miniature by three great masters: Gustave Courbet, Vincent Van Gogh and Gustav Klimt. All three of the paintings were at one point lost or stolen\u2014and then found again. The faces of each are guilloched in different patterns and then colored to match the spirit and harmony of the paintings on the \u201chidden\u201d reverse side. The works in the Reverso Tribute Enamel Hidden Treasures trio were chosen not only because of their intriguing provenance but because the artists were active when the Reverso was introduced in 1931. It was a watershed moment in the Western artistic tradition, from the 19th-Century Realism of Gustave Courbet to Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s Post-Impressionism, to the expressive and experimental spirit of Gustave Klimt and the Viennese Secession. \u201cWe wanted the story to be relevant to the collection and to the watchmaking crafts that were coming into use at the time, such as guillochage, but also with a nice angle,\u201d says Catherine R\u00e9nier, CEO of Jaeger-LeCoultre. \u201cThe complexity of the miniaturization was a challenge,\u201d she says. \u201cWe approached the museums hosting the paintings today to discuss the finer points of the interpretations, and the colors, etc.\u201d Jaeger-LeCoultre established its own in-house enameling atelier in the 1990s. Courbet\u2019s View of Lake L\u00e9man (1876) on Jaeger-LeCoultre\u2019s latest Reverso watch. Jaeger-LeCoultre The Courbet piece, View of Lake L\u00e9man (1876), captures a view of Lake Geneva near Vevey, Switzerland, where Courbet lived after being exiled from his native France in 1873. He was inspired by the constantly changing views across the water and painted the lake many times. The piece in question was hung in a small museum along with several minor works by minor artists. It was discovered by a curator, who took it to an expert who confirmed it was genuine. Courbet painted with a blade rather than a brush, which gives his works a distinctive style. The dial side of the Reverso Courbet model is decorated with herringbone guilloch\u00e9 texture, and colored misty gray-blue. Van Gogh\u2019s Sunset at Montmajour (1888) on Jaeger-LeCoultre\u2019s latest Reverso watch. Jaeger-LeCoultre The Van Gogh painting, Sunset at Montmajour (1888), is an example of the artist\u2019s quest to portray nature in new ways, capturing the distinctive vegetation of Provence and the rich colors of the golden hour just before sunset. This painting is said to have been hung by a private owner in his home, and that a visiting guest dismissed it as a fake. The owner banished it to the attic. It was discovered years later by his family, who took it to the Vincent Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. Experts analyzed it and determined the pigments were exactly the same as those Van Gogh used and deemed it genuine. Jaeger-LeCoultre\u2019s master painter faithfully reproduced the artist\u2019s strong sense of perspective, signature brush stroke and heavy impasto, a technique that uses thick layers of paint that raise above the canvas. The dial side is decorated in a sunray barleycorn guilloch\u00e9 pattern and colored a shade of green to complement the rich gold and russet tones of the painting. Klimt\u2019s Portrait of a Lady (1917) on Jaeger-LeCoultre\u2019s latest Reverso watch. Jaeger-LeCoultre The Klimt painting, Portrait of a Lady (1917), is the only known \u201cdouble\u201d portrait by the Viennese artist, painted over an earlier work. Klimt had fallen madly in love with a young woman who became his muse, then suddenly died. Attempting to ease the pain of his loss, he painted over her portrait with a new one, of a different lady. She bears the same fashionable outfit and elegant pose that is characteristic of Klimt\u2019s work. In the late 1990s, the work was set to be exhibited at a gallery in Italy but was stolen before the exhibition opened. It was discovered a few days later by a gardener working on the property.

    "description": "The best cycling headphones for adding music to your ride, both indoors and out",
    "content": "The best headphones for cycling aren't necessarily specifically designed for the job of accompanying us on the bike, but a combination of selected features and qualities make them ideal for the rigours of two-wheeled adventure. They will typically offer a combination of sound clarity, waterproofing (and thus sweat-proofing), comfort, access to controls, and durability. However, the pair of cycling headphones that perfectly match your needs will undoubtedly differ from one person to the next. Some will want to listen to music at the highest volume possible during Zwift races and indoor sessions, while others will prefer a quiet audiobook or podcast during an easy spin along the bike path. Many will turn to headphones to shut out their surroundings, while those of us cycling among traffic will likely want nothing less. Many would argue that the best cycling headphones for riding outdoors are no headphones at all. Being unable to hear your surroundings whilst riding on a road is not something we'd recommend, but that doesn't mean you can't still listen to your entertainment of choice whilst indoors or off-road, and there are a few options that allow external noise alongside the sounds coming from the headphones. If you're looking for the best cycling headphones for riding indoors, then the primary requirement will likely be sweat proofing, whereas for riding outside, you might want something that uses bone conduction technology instead of plugging your ear canals, or you may simply put more value on sound clarity and ease of volume control.Wherever you ride, a pair of headphones can make the difference between enjoying or enduring your ride, and completing or failing your workout. So here are a few suggestions for the best cycling headphones to add a musical tailwind to your next workouts. The best cycling headphones available today (Image credit: Graham Cottingham) Aftershokz Aeropex Best heapdhones for cycling outside: The Aftershokz's bone conduction technology leaves your ears openBattery Life: Up to 8 continuous hours | Waterproof: IP67 | Noise Cancelling: None | RRP: \u00a3149.95 / $159.95 / \u20ac169,95 / AU$249Keeps you aware of your surroundingsLighter than previous bone conduction optionsImpressive real-world battery lifeVery loud environments can drown out the music Along the same lines of one pair of headphones that work in a lot of situations, you might need to stay aware of your surroundings. While it's okay to be completely sealed off from distractions inside that's not the case outside. If you also ride, or run, with music outside then you should be able to hear your surroundings. Aftershokz is a company known for bone conduction technology and the Aeropex is its latest option. Instead of a speaker that sits near your ear, Aftershokz directs vibrations up your cheekbone. The result is that you can hear the music but also the environment. As they don't plug into your ears the Aeropex are extremely secure and comfortable, so no matter how hard or long you go they won't get irritating. (Image credit: Jaybird Sport) Jaybird Vista 2Best headphones for cycling indoors: Absolutely will not fall out and they sound amazingBattery Life: 24 hours | Waterproof: IP68 | Noise Cancelling: ANC & SurroundSense | RRP: \u00a3189.99 / $199.99 / \u20ac209,00 / AU$N/AMore secure in your ear than any other true wireless earbudActive Noise Cancellation with SurroundSense to allow noise inCan make your ears sore after a while True wireless earbuds are a great way to handle music while riding indoors. There are no wires to get in the way and being able to ride with only one at a time can extend the listening time. Not all true wireless earbuds feel secure in your ear though. There's nothing quite as annoying as an earbud that feels like it's going to fall out when you are sprinting for the win in a Zwift race.The Jaybird Vista true wireless earbuds are totally secure. They will not move, even a little bit, no matter what you are doing. That security comes by way of a tight seal in your ear and that has its own advantages. They are so well sealed with Active Noise Cancellation that if you need ear protection, they can pull double duty as earplugs, however, if you want to let the outside world in, double tap to switch on SurroundSense. (Image credit: Anker) Anker Soundcore Life P2Best budget headphones for cycling: Budget-friendly, lightweight and IPX7 ratedBattery Life: 7 hours continuous, 40 hours with charge case | Waterproof: IPX7 | Noise Cancelling: None | RRP: \u00a349.99 / $49.99 / \u20ac49,99 / AU$N/ADouble microphone for background noise supression on callsEach can be paired individuallyCase is slightly bulky for pocketingCan work their way loose over the course of a ride The Anker Soundcore Life P2 is a budget-friendly pair of cycling headphones that punch well above their weight in performance terms. They promise up to seven hours of continuous playback, although at the loud volumes we like for our indoor cycling setting, we found this time ran closer to around five hours. With the charging case, this time extends to offer 40 hours of battery, and a fast charge means little downtime between listening. You can choose to use either ear on its own - useful for outdoor riding - or both together. You can even pair each ear to separate devices, and whichever comes out of the case first will become the 'main' ear, and the second ear will mimic. So if you like to flit between listening via a laptop and a smartphone, just pick up the corresponding ear first. They do tend to work their way loose over the course of a sweaty ride, however this is noticeable enough that you can nudge them back into place before they fall. We've tested them over bumpy gravel terrain, long road days, indoor races and more and we've not managed to lose one yet, however with their diminutive size and a lack of a find-me beacon, don't expect to find them if you do accidentally drop them out in the wild. (Image credit: Jabra) Jabra Elite 85hBest over-ear headphones for cycling: If you aren't a fan of in-ear or want to completely isolate yourself in music and your workoutBattery Life: Up to 36 continuous hours | Waterproof: Nano-coating of the internal components | Noise Cancelling: Active | RRP: \u00a3219.99 / $249.99 / \u20ac249,99 / AU$379.99Long battery LifeGreat warrantySuperior noise-cancelling and sound isolationNo actual IP ratingOver ear headphones means extra sweat While some headphone uses need to allow outside noise, some don't. Riding indoors you probably don't need to hear what's happening around you. The Jabra 85H noise cancelling is second to none. That amazing active noise cancelling also comes with plenty of battery life. If you want to be completely focused while you tackle a virtual Everest ride then the 36 hours of useability should do the trick. On the other hand, if you need to call a friend during that event the 6 of 8 onboard mics dedicated to voice calls will keep you clear to the other person. (Image credit: Adidas) Adidas RPT-01Runner-up over ear headphones: Sport focused with washable fabric coversBattery Life: Up to 40 continuous hours | Waterproof: IPX4 | Noise Cancelling: None | RRP: \u00a3119.99 / $169 / \u20ac169,00 / AU$270Long battery lifeWashable fabric coversCan cause discomfort from how tight they are If you like the idea of an over-the-ear headphone for your workouts but you need something more workout focused than the Jabra, Adidas has an answer. There is an IPX4 rating and the ear cups, as well as the inner headband, feature fabric covers that can be removed for washing. Without any active noise cancelling you won't stay completely isolated. The controls on the headphones will help keep you from needing to fiddle with your phone while working out though. (Image credit: Sony) Sony WI-SP510Best in-ear headphones for cyclists who have a habit of losing thingsBattery Life: Up to 15 continuous hours | Waterproof: IPX5 | Noise Cancelling: None | RRP: \u00a370.00 / $79.99 / \u20ac80,00 / AU$179.95InexpensiveIncluded mic for phone callsCable hangs around neck to prevent loss if one is taken (or falls) outNot the best sound quality Sony has been the king of inexpensive, quality headphones for years, and that hasn't changed. While you can spend a lot of money on amazing headphones not everyone wants to do that. If you want something that is both good and inexpensive the WI-SP510 is a perfect choice. They aren't true wireless, the two earbuds have a wired connection, but there's no wire to your device. Along with that extra wire, you get longer battery life and the ease of hanging them at your neck, making them harder to drop and lose, while also reducing cost. These are the kind of headphones that just work. (Image credit: Sennheiser ) Sennheiser Momentum 2Best in-ear headphones for cyclists who want maximum sound qualityBattery Life: 7 hours continuous, 28 with case | Waterproof: IPX4 | Noise Cancelling: Active | RRP: \u00a3279.00 / $299.95 / \u20ac299,00 / AU$499.95Battery lifeRange of ear top optionsNoise cancellingExpensive These svelte black earphones are just about as good as you can get if you're looking for a pair of in-ear wireless earphones for indoor cycling. Sennheiser is an expert in the audio game, and it shows with these buds.One improvement on the first edition of these buds is the addition of active noise cancelling, joining the number of premium earphones that offer such a feature. The feature can be toggled on and off via touch control or Sennheiser's Smart Control app, so you won't be oblivious to traffic if you're cycling outdoors.The touch controls also let you control a range of other functions, including playing or pausing audio, as well as skipping back and forth. Compatibility with voice assistants Siri and Google Assistant is also enabled.Other features include a seven-hour battery life, which extended to 28 when charged via battery case. There are four pairs of ear tips too, in a range of sizes to fit you, while a USB-C charging cable is also included. If you have the cash, then the Sennheiser Momentum 2 is a great choice. How to choose the best cycling headphones When it comes to choosing the best headphones for cycling, you'll need to think about what your cycling usually involves, as there are so many different types of ride and each will have a different set of requirements that will make headphones suitable or not. If you're only ever planning on using your headphones whilst riding indoors, look for something with high waterproofing and sweatproofing, and good sound quality. If you're planning on using them on the road, proceed with caution and consider headphones that allow you to hear the outside world just as clearly as if you weren't wearing any. The last thing you want is to be deaf to your surroundings when cars are speeding by. If riding anywhere outside, you may want to find a pair with numerous controls that allow you to change track/volume/etc without having to fish your phone out of your pocket each time. Also consider your other needs for headphones - will you use them in work video calls? If so, you might want a pair that can handle multiple Bluetooth connections so that you can switch between your phone and computer without having to delete and re-pair. If you're thinking about over-ear headphones, they might be great on the bike, but will they become cumbersome in other walks of life, such as travelling or commuting, as you can't exactly slide them into your pocket? We can't tell you exactly which are the best cycling headphones for you, but spend time considering your needs and you'll be half way to choosing. What do IP ratings mean in headphones? You are working hard, getting a great workout, and sweating a lot. With that in mind, you want to make sure you aren't going to kill your headphones by sweating on them so you check out the IP rating. What is an IP rating though and what do the numbers mean?IP stands for ingress protection and it's a simple rating that signifies how waterproof, and dustproof, something is. A low IP rating might work for you when you are riding with a fan pointed at your face but it won't work for swimming. Whatever your need is the IP rating just lets you match your needs to what you are purchasing. After the letters \"I\" and \"P\" there are two numbers. Sometimes instead of two numbers there is an X then a number. The first place is a measure of dust protection. The second place is a measure of water protection. If there's an X in either location it means that the product has no testing for that rating. No testing doesn't mean no protection, it just means no testing. Headphones are often not tested for dust ingress. Still, since waterproofing can mean sealing the internals, they might be fine in a lot of dusty situations. Alternatively, no IP rating doesn't always mean no water resistance. Jabra has no IP rating but the internals have a nano protection that will protect them from some water. Some people sweat more than others. Decide what you are comfortable with. Also consider the design. A true wireless headphone is more likely to accidentally fall into water while an over-ear headphone is more capable of collecting water. Consider sorting music based on BPM Music is strongly linked to performance. The connection is so strong that studies show raising the beats per minute of your music can positively affect your workout. You can ride farther and faster without an increase in perceived difficulty if you choose the right music. It's also incredibly easy to get the BPM you want.If you use Spotify, there are a variety of services such as playlistmachinery.com that will help you find the perfect BPM. For YouTube Music, Apple Music, or Amazon Music the best way to handle it is to search for your preferred BPM. A quick search will have you listening to exactly the speed that matches what you are doing that day.",

    "full_description": "A weird bug is leaving FIFA22 players on Stadia with broken squads and thousands of incorrect player names for almost every team in the game. Reports have grown over the past few days with a multitude of complaints on the /r/Stadia subreddit by avid FIFA22 players seeing some interesting player names . There doesn\u2019t appear to be a fix, but this issue could be related to the squad synchronization settings that EA implements when playing the title offline. Due to the various connotations of IRL team performance, transfers, and retirements throughout the course of a season, EA pushes FIFA22 squad updates regularly to ensure that you are playing with the most up-to-date data and stats. While it\u2019s not entirely clear if this is the culprit, it is only the most recent roster update that has broken player names on Stadia. There are no reports of squad issues on other platforms, making this solely a Stadia problem for now. While some in the Stadia subreddit have been speculating that this is related to player name rights, this is highly unlikely as the Federation Internationale des Associations de Footballeurs Professionnel (FIFPro) represents global professional footballers and provides licenses for likenesses and player names in collaboration with over 65,000 professionals. This is under dispute from some high-profile players, but it\u2019s unlikely that this is the reason for issues surrounding player names as in-game likenesses remain unchanged. It\u2019s worth noting that not all players have issues. I have personally spotted a few players for the club I support \u2013 Hull City AFC. The less said about how well my team\u2019s real-life counterparts are performing, the better, but a few players added to the game in the previous squad update remain unchanged. The name issues also do not affect FIFA22 Career Mode squads on Stadia: Tom Huddlestone and Di\u2019Shon Bernard appear unaffected by name issues. FIFA22 Career Mode is similarly unaffected This problem could simply be a database issue with players wrongly assigned or tagged incorrectly as all other stats remain intact. My bet \u2013 having actually worked in soccer data management in a past life \u2013 is that this squads update simply has incorrectly mapped player names and a simple squad update will fix the problem.

As for the shooting itself, the trailer shows Master Chief using the usual array of guns and explosives, while the new grappleshot helps him grab far-off weapons or drag himself toward enemies for a quick melee attack. We also get a look at some vehicle stations that should let Master Chief hop in a Wasp or Warthog whenever he wants, and there are one-on-one arena battles with some suspiciously boss-like foes.

    "content": "Almost every bib tight design on the market is similar. There's nuance, of course, and that's why some of them make our list of the best winter bib tights for cycling in the cold and some don't. The broad strokes are very similar though: it's unusual to find something that's totally different and that's what the POC Thermal VPDs bib tights represent. Different doesn't necessarily mean better though, so to figure out how the different design worked, we've put them to the test. Keep reading to see what we thought worked and what did not. We have suggestions about when it makes sense to choose this solution from POC and how they might fit into your cycling wardrobe. There are four reflective hits plus the logo. (Image credit: Josh Ross) Design and aesthetics Most bib tights use a simple construction and some variation of a brushed back fabric, then depending on the focus, there might then be additional features to deal with wind or rain. These POC VPDs Thermal Bib tights are totally different, and the first place you notice this is in the fabric. Instead of a brushed-back Roubaix fabric, POC uses a thin fabric that's smooth on both sides, and it's less dense in the low back, back of the thighs, and back of the knees. These areas lack specific wind protection and this is where excess heat and moisture is able to get out. You can think of it as covering the rear of the bibs although it's actually a very complex pattern. There are seventeen panels that come together to form the POC VPDs Thermal Bib tights and that doesn't even count the extra material that forms the straps. By using so many panels POC has the opportunity to use the exact material in the area it wants and to pre-shape the garment. While the rear of the tights has a fabric that easily breathes, the front is a wind-blocking fabric. Starting at the ankle there's a wide gripper panel to help keep the bottom in place. As you move up, the calf has a front and a rear panel both utilising the wind-blocking fabric: the difference in feel is subtle but you can detect it with your fingers. At the knees, you'll find another two panels. The front is the wind blocker again while the rear is the more breathable fabric and it's significantly shorter, which pre-curves the bend in the knee. Although every seam is a flatlock stitch, there is, wisely, no seam directly behind the knee in the area that bends. Above the knee, the already complex pattern gets even more complex with the addition of a third panel at the sides. There's still a wind-blocking front and a breathable rear but now there's also a strip at the outside of the thigh, which also uses the wind-blocking fabric. Both the front and side wind-blocking panels continue to the top of the waist, while in the rear, above the chamois panels, there is one more breathable panel connecting the two sides across the low back. The mesh that makes up the straps starts nice and high up the torso. If your jacket moves around, there's enough room to keep the lower torso protected from cold. The straps themselves use two pieces of the same fabric and join near the top of the shoulders. There's very little density to the mesh but the addition of a folded edge keeps enough structure that they don't roll up when you're putting them on. Inside the POC Thermal VPDs bib tight is where you'll find the chamois that gives the bibs their name. There's Elastic Interface branding with a 3D sculpted design, and most of it is 2mm thick and only a light padding. There are two main panels that travel from the perineum to the sit bones on either side and utilise silicone in the most important areas. It's not a large pad but it's got the necessary density where it's needed. The VPDs chamois is a multi-density design with silicone under the pressure points. (Image credit: Josh Ross) Ride experience My absolute favourite thing about the POC Thermal VPDs bib tights is the chamois. In the spots you need the most protection, POC uses a silicone insert. It's not the kind of waterbed-like silicone chamois you might find in cheap bibs but instead, it's essentially unnoticeable. The benefit is that right under your sit bone it's impossible to fully compress the pad. To test how well this approach worked, I took these out for 110 miles on a route that RideWithGPS reports as 38-per cent gravel. At the end of a day like that, I'm always tired but what I look for in a good chamois is a lack of tenderness. If it's lacking, I'll start to get sore around 60 miles and by the end of the ride, I'm standing while coasting then sore for days after. The POC chamois was a huge success. Not only was I not bruised or tender, but I wasn't even all that sore after a little under eight hours of riding. In terms of the rest of the construction, it's a very unique take on the needs of cold weather riding. The material is thin and lacks an insulative layer. Instead, you get a wind-blocking layer that is closer to a hard shell than most other bib tights. For an overcast day ranging from 51F/10.5C up to 56F/13.3C and a short period of light rain, these were perfect. I paired the POC bib tights with a POC thermal cap, Sportful Bodyfit Pro long sleeve jersey, Gore C5 Thermo jersey, Castelli Idro Pro 2 jacket, and Castelli Perfetto Ros gloves. When it was warmer, I shed the hat and relied on the POC Ventral Tempus Spin helmet alone. During the coldest parts of the day, I was somewhat cold but putting the hat back on solved it. I felt like I could have shed layers and been comfortable on a warmer day but this was about as low as I would have wanted to use these bibs. The fit I found true to expectations. I normally wear a small and a small was right in these as well. Below the knee, I did find them to be a bit loose though. I'm still happy to wear them but the calf and ankle isn't a perfect fit on me. POC uses lots of panels so that they can pre-shape the knee with a curve. (Image credit: Josh Ross) Verdict A great chamois on a pair of bib tights goes a long way, so if I can ride for eight hours and not feel sore, I'm willing to put up with a lot of other concessions. The POC Thermal VPDs bib tights back up the excellent chamois with a well thought out design that fills a hole in the market. When you have wind protection, you can stand for a lot less insulation and that's the direction POC has gone. The lower leg section isn't perfect for me but despite that small negative they won't be leaving my rotation anytime soon. If the weather is colder, or wetter, I'll expect to add layers and continue to take advantage of the top of the line chamois.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The world is replete with hundreds of heartbreaking stories of what the Covid-19 pandemic has done to the citizens of this world. People have lost loved ones, economies have been upended, and unemployment has skyrocketed. Image Source - Creative Asset PETRONAS Thankfully, there are also many inspiring stories of how the indomitable human spirit empowers people to create opportunities despite the downturn. One such story is that of Nurul Ezzati Mohamed Nasir, CEO of Teman Malaysia, who wanted to care for ordinary folks when the pandemic hit. A trained dietician, she had worked regular 9-to-5 jobs before, when she felt she could do much more with herself. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where or how to begin, but I knew that I wanted to be an entrepreneur and I wanted to help other people with my work,\u201d Ezzati says. At that crossroad, she chanced upon the concept of a \u201csocial enterprise,\u201d and though it was vague to her, she had researched enough to know that if she started one, she could effect change and still be financially sustainable. A Social Enterprise is a cause-driven business that aims to improve lives and serve the common good through a market-driven approach. But how are social enterprises important to the economy? And could they be the key to rebuilding unemployment worldwide ravaged by the pandemic? A McKinsey report , \u201cScaling the Impact of the Social Enterprise Sector,\u201d noted that a 0.9% growth in social enterprises in the Netherlands from 2010 to 2015, brought about more than a 60% increase or 25,000 new jobs within the sector, with total revenue rising by 75% to \u20ac3.5 billion in 2015. Revenue and jobs aside, organizations today are no longer solely evaluated by financial performance but by the relationship they have with employees, customers and the impact they have on their communities and on society at large, according to a 2018 Deloitte study . This is why more corporations are tapping into social enterprises so that they can generate new ideas for growth and a community of consumers that will sustain this growth into the future. Perhaps this is the way forward for businesses in the light of what the world is experiencing globally today. \"We need more corporations, financial institutions and industry heavyweights to get involved in creating a healthy and robust ecosystem for social enterprises in Malaysia, said Datuk Md Arif Mahmood, EVP and CEO Downstream, PETRONAS, and Advisor of SEEd.Lab. \u201cCombining our expertise and resources with the passion from these young entrepreneurs, we can generate economic growth and directly address community pain-points for a better Malaysia.\" With this deep belief in the power of social enterprise, PETRONAS partnered with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to establish The Social Enterprise Education Lab. SEEd.Lab , is a first-of-its-kind social innovation hub that aims to develop young change makers in setting up sustainable social enterprises that address social pain-points to positively impact the lives of communities. The 12- to 18-month program nurtures young graduates and budding entrepreneurs to develop, scale and grow a social enterprise from ideation, incubation to commercialization.\u200b At the end of this journey, graduates, or SEEd.lings, are armed with the knowledge to successfully become proud founders of their own social enterprise.\u200b Compassionate Companions After that moment of clarity hit Ezzati, she signed up with SEEd.Lab as part of its Cohort 1, where her idea for a social enterprise called Teman Malaysia was born. Translated from Malay to mean \u201cMalaysian Companions,\u201d Ezzati says, \u201cTeman Malaysia provides social services for the duration of as little as one hour and this makes it more feasible for those who may not be able to commit to a hefty fee that locks them in for the entire duration.\u201d The assistance services can include welfare check-ins, running errands for/with clients or just simply lending a helping hand to those who need it. All companions or \u201cTemanions\u201d\u2013a portmanteau of the Malay word teman and its English equivalent companions\u2013comprise volunteers who can be other gig workers looking for extra work, which goes a long way in addressing youth unemployment. Nurturing Foodpreneurs For food biotechnology graduate Zahaby Zainuddin and Ezzati\u2019s fellow SEEd.Lab cohort mate, being a food entrepreneur or a \u201cfoodpreneur\u201d was his dream. \u201cBut going into the world of startups on your own can be difficult. Even with all the knowhow, you\u2019ll still need a hand to open doors to networks, funding and support.\u201d With a penchant for food and a desire to succeed, he closely researched the pain-points foodpreneurs faced during his ideation stage at SEEd.Lab. Concluding that they lacked capital, adequate kitchen space, and had little experience in marketing and regulatory processes, Zahaby established Foodlab, a cloud kitchen, to target the under-35 foodpreneurs, whom he believes, like him, found it hard to establish the venture. \u201cFrom the beginning, our goals are rather straightforward. We want to combat youth unemployment and sustain a profitable business doing that,\u201d says the CEO of Foodlab. \u201cWhile other cloud kitchens target more established businesses, we are looking at the young entrepreneurs who are just starting out, helping them navigate the challenges of a budding business.\u201d Today, Foodlab operates a 650-square-foot commercial kitchen with all the necessary industrial kitchen equipment at Publika, Kuala Lumpur. It also helps its clients with accounting assistance, a point-of-sale system, access to markets, and even business registration, marketing and photography services. \u201cWe also handle the cleaning of the premises\u2013all the nitty-gritty details so that these foodpreneurs can focus on what they do best: the food.\u201d Aidonna Jun Ayub, the Program Manager of SEEd.Lab, says it is currently running its Cohort 2 focusing on education and skills; food and agriculture; health and hygiene; and personal and financial security. \u201cOur mission remains absolute as we reflect on the impact of Covid-19 that is still unfolding, giving rise to concerns of more serious economic and social implications for our nation.\u201d \u201cBeing able to connect to the right people in the right space and having the opportunity to convince them to take a chance on the solutions or products is imperative for these ventures to grow further. SEEd.Lab aims to support social enterprises through some of these challenges.\u201d",

    "full_description": "An intriguing candidate signal picked up last year by the Breakthrough Listen project has been subjected to intensive analysis that suggests it is unlikely to originate from the Proxima Centauri system. Instead, it appears to be an artifact of Earth-based interference from human technologies, the Breakthrough Initiatives announced today. Two research papers, published in Nature Astronomy, discuss both the detection of the candidate signal and an advanced data analysis process that can finely discern \"false positives.\" \"The significance of this result is that the search for civilizations beyond our planet is now a mature, rigorous field of experimental science,\" said Yuri Milner, founder of Breakthrough Inititatives. Breakthrough Listen (a program of the Breakthrough Initiatives) is an astronomical science program searching for technosignatures - signs of technology that may have been developed by extraterrestrial intelligence. Listen's science team, led by Dr. Andrew Siemion at the University of California, Berkeley, uses some of the largest radio telescopes in the world, equipped with the most capable digital processing systems, to capture data across broad swaths of the radio spectrum in the direction of a wide range of celestial targets. The search is challenging because Earth is awash with radio signals from human technology - cell phones, radar, satellites, TV transmitters, and so on. Searching for a faint signal from a distant star is akin to picking out a needle in a vast digital haystack - and one that is changing constantly over time. BLC1 - Breakthrough Listen's First \"Signal of Interest\" - Data and other related material The CSIRO Parkes Telescope in New South Wales, Australia (one of the largest telescopes in the Southern Hemisphere, known as 'Murriyang' in Wiradjuri) is among the facilities participating in Breakthrough Listen's search. One of the targets being monitored by Parkes is Proxima Centauri, the Sun's nearest neighboring star, at a distance of just over 4 light years. The star is a red dwarf orbited by two known exoplanets. The Listen team scanned the target across a frequency range of 700 MHz to 4 GHz, with a resolution of 3.81 Hz - in other words, performing the equivalent of tuning to over 800 million radio channels at a time, with exquisite detection sensitivity. Shane Smith, an undergraduate researcher working with Listen Project Scientist Dr. Danny Price in the summer 2020 Breakthrough Listen internship program, ran the data from these observations through Breakthrough Listen's search pipeline. He detected over 4 million \"hits\" - frequency ranges that had signs of radio emission. This is actually quite typical for Listen's observations; the vast majority of these hits make up the haystack of emissions from human technology. As with all of Listen's observations, the pipeline filters out signals which look like they are unlikely to be coming from a transmitter at a large distance from Earth, according to two main criteria: \u00b7 Firstly, is the signal steadily changing in frequency with time? A transmitter on a distant planet would be expected to be in motion with respect to the telescope, leading to a Doppler drift akin to the change in pitch of an ambulance siren as it moves relative to an observer. Rejecting hits with no such signs of motion reduces the number of hits from 4 million to around 1 million for this particular dataset. \u00b7 Secondly, for the hits that remain, do they appear to be coming from the direction of the target? To determine this, the telescope points in the direction of Proxima Centauri, and then points away, repeating this \"ON - OFF\" pattern several times. Local interfering sources are expected to affect both ON and OFF observations, whereas a candidate technosignature should appear only in the ON observations. Even after both of these data filters are applied, a handful of candidates remain that must be inspected visually. Sometimes a faint signal is actually visible in the OFF observations but is not quite strong enough to be picked up by automated algorithms. Sometimes similar signals appear in neighboring observations, indicative of interfering sources that may be turning on and off at just the wrong period, or the team can track down the signals to satellites that commonly broadcast in certain frequency bands. Occasionally an intriguing signal remains and must be subjected to further checks. Such a signal-of-interest was discovered by Smith in Listen's observations of Proxima Centauri using the Parkes telescope. A narrow-band, Doppler-drifting signal, persisting over five hours of observations, that appears to be present only in \"ON'' observations of the target star and not in the interspersed \"OFF\" observations, had some of the characteristics expected from a technosignature candidate. Dr. Sofia Sheikh, currently a postdoctoral researcher with the Listen team at UC Berkeley, dug into a larger dataset of observations taken at other times. She found around 60 signals that share many characteristics of the candidate, but are also seen in their respective OFF observations. \"We can therefore confidently say that these other signals are local to the telescope and human-generated,\" says Sheikh. \"The signals are spaced at regular frequency intervals in the data, and these intervals appear to correspond to multiples of frequencies used by oscillators that are commonly used in various electronic devices. Taken together, this evidence suggests that the signal is interference from human technology, although we were unable to identify its specific source. The original signal found by Shane Smith is not obviously detected when the telescope is pointed away from Proxima Centauri - but given a haystack of millions of signals, the most likely explanation is still that it is a transmission from human technology that happens to be 'weird' in just the right way to fool our filters.\" Executive Director of the Breakthrough Initiatives Dr. S. Pete Worden remarked, \"While we were unable to conclude a genuine technosignature, we are increasingly confident that we have the necessary tools to detect and validate such signatures if they exist.\" Breakthrough Listen is making all of the data from the Parkes scans available to the public to examine for themselves. The team has also just published two papers (led by Smith and Sheikh) outlining the details of the data acquisition and analysis, and a research note describing follow-up observations of Proxima Centauri conducted with the Parkes Telescope in April 2021. Listen will continue monitoring of Proxima Centauri, which remains a compelling target for technosignature searches, using a suite of telescopes around the world. And the team continues to refine algorithms to improve their ability to discriminate between \"needles\" and \"hay\", including as part of a recently-completed crowdsourced data processing competition in collaboration with kaggle.com. \"In the case of this particular candidate,\" remarks Siemion, \"our analysis suggests that it's highly unlikely that it is really from a transmitter out at Proxima Centauri. However, this is undoubtedly one of the most intriguing signals we've seen to date.\" Preprints of the papers, links to the data and associated software, artwork, videos, and supplementary content may be accessed at http://seti.berkeley.edu/blc1 About the Breakthrough Initiatives The Breakthrough Initiatives are a suite of space science programs - Listen, Starshot and Watch - investigating the fundamental questions of life in the Universe.

Startup Rivian is the first to deliver a fully-electric pickup truck to American buyers, but despite its early success, the company's latest filing with the SEC shows that its production line is not quite rolling full steam ahead. In the filing , which Rivian submitted to the SEC in late October, the automaker states that it has begun production of the R1T truck, but the numbers it claims aren't exactly full-scale in their scope. \"As of September 30, 2021, we produced 12 R1Ts and delivered 11 R1Ts, and as of October 22, 2021, we produced 56 R1Ts and delivered 42 R1Ts\" the filing reads. That's around two trucks rolling off the Rivian production line each day \u2013 not quite mind blowing. We know Rivian has stout orders for Amazon vans, but the company has noted that production of those vehicles isn't scheduled to start until December. It also plans to start delivering its next consumer electric vehicle around the same time, with the filing stating; \"we plan to launch and commence customer deliveries for the R1S, a three-row seven-passenger sports utility vehicle (\"SUV\") in December 2021 following the completion of ongoing vehicle validation and all required testing.\" Still, at two trucks per day, Rivian has quite a way to go before it will be able to fulfill the 48,390 pre-orders it says are lined up for the R1T and R1S. It's unclear what is holding the company back - the likelihood is the production line is still working on getting up to speed - but what is clear is it has serious competition coming soon. The Ford F-150 Lightning is due next year and the GMC Hummer EV won't be far behind.

[+] together - Friendship, empowering, teamwork, partnership and youth lifestyle concept getty Oh, if they can only get you hooked at a young age. That\u2019s the goal with Big Tech companies like Facebook, who hope to get teenagers obsessed with an app like Instagram and slowly move them over to a much bigger platform like Facebook someday, according to an internal doc and a recent profile of Instagram users . Using the word \u201cpipeline\u201d in an internal doc reveals what we all know already about social media companies. They are bating teens with a friendly app, one that doesn\u2019t focus as much on links and ads, in hopes that they will keep looking for other platforms as they get older. Sound familiar? The worry, according to the report, is that Instagram isn\u2019t quite the gateway drug for social media as it once was. The report makes it clear: \u201cIn a survey this year from the financial services firm Piper Sandler, 35 percent of teenagers said Snapchat was their favorite social media platform, with 30 percent saying TikTok. Instagram was third with 22 percent.\u201d Instagram currently enjoys a large populace of about 1.3 billion users. None of us really know or understand what lures in the teen population, since even Gen-Z don\u2019t seem to know. We do know that every young generation is drawn to what is new and shiny (although, guess what \u2014 so are middle-aged and older people). Should we be worried that Facebook uses a word like pipeline ? Yes, we should. The reason it\u2019s a bit alarming is that it reveals how much they view these apps as part of a strategic marketing campaign to host more ads, not so much as useful tools to help us communicate and discover new things. MORE FOR YOU A New Clubhouse Feature Aims To Increase Small, Private Chats\u2014And Deeper Engagement Facebook Admits It Reported Faulty Numbers To Advertisers, Blames Apple AOC\u2019s \u2018Tax The Rich Dress\u2019 \u2013 Ultimate Fashion Statement Or Display Of Hypocrisy If we were talking about highly productive apps meant to enrich our lives and make us feel more connected, as Facebook often states, then the internal docs would not talk about something that sounds suspiciously like a sales funnel. What it would sound like instead is more like a real product. Improving the experience, making information easier to find. The word pipeline is the same one you might expect a car dealership to use. The conversation might go like this: The boss to his sales employee: \u201cSo where is that customer in the pipeline?\u201d Salesperson: \u201cThey seem to be kicking the tires.\u201d Boss: \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can entice them a little more with a warranty or other perk, okay?\u201d It all starts to seem like rats in a maze, except the cheese is all about likes, shares, and reactions, and the maze runs on your phone. For the last few years, and especially once the movie The Social Dilemma debuted on Netflix, experts have started telling us that Facebook and Instagram are like slot machines. You pull down on the screen in Instagram to see new rewards. You check Facebook to see your likes. Now, knowing there is a pipeline involved, it seems like social media firms have decided that Instagram is the initial hook \u2014 the pull-tabs at the bar, perhaps. Teens eventually \u201cgraduate\u201d to the bigger slot machines of Facebook and Twitter. At least, that\u2019s the hope they have. Catch them young, reel them in. If you know teens or happen to be one yourself, the word of caution here is that companies like Facebook see you as a user. The issue is that the word \u201cuser\u201d has a dramatically different connotation when it comes to using their apps.",

    "full_description": "Researchers from the Institute of Process Engineering (IPE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University and Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University have developed a ferritin (Fn)-based nanomedicine for targeted delivery of arsenic (As) and efficient therapy against diverse leukemia types. The study was published in Nature Nanotechnology on Oct. 25. Leukemia is a severe threat to human health, with poor survival rates for both adults and children. In the clinic, chemotherapy is still the main therapeutic modality for all types of leukemia and inevitably induces off-target distribution and toxic side effects. Targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to leukemia cells can relieve toxic side effects and enhance therapeutic effects . Several new targets have been identified on leukemia cells, but their expression features vary greatly for different types and courses of leukemia. Through screening large numbers of clinical samples, researchers confirmed that patients with different forms of leukemia featured stable and strong expression of CD71. \"CD71 can be used as a new and reliable target for the development of anti-leukemia precision therapies,\" said Prof. Li Yuhua of Zhujiang Hospital. As the CD71 ligand, Fn has a unique quaternary structure and interior cavity, which are favorable for drug accommodation. With the assistance of a ferric-mediated coordination process, trivalent As (AsIII), the medicinal form of the chemotherapeutic drug arsenic trioxide (ATO), was efficiently loaded inside Fn. \"The loading content is ~200 As in each Fn and the As matches the known clinically efficacious valence state of the approved ATO,\" said Prof. Ma Ding of Peking University. The As@Fn formulation retained a strong capacity to bind to diverse types of leukemia cells. After internalization, the AsIII would then be released in the acidic lysosome. \"We are excited to observe that our As@Fn nanomedicine significantly improved As accumulation in leukemia cells both in vitro and in vivo,\" said Prof. Wei Wei from IPE. \"Such target behavior is favorable for improving the killing effect on leukemia cells while reducing the toxicity to normal tissues.\" In terms of therapeutic efficacy, As@Fn outperformed the gold standard in diverse cell line-derived xenograft models, as well as in a patient-derived xenograft model. \"This nanomedicine not only expanded the therapeutic window of As but also extended the application to more types of leukemia,\" said Prof. Ma Guanghui from IPE. \"Given that Fn is an endogenous protein and ATO has been approved for clinical anti-leukemia use, our nanomedicine has the potential for clinical translation.\" A peer reviewer from Nature Nanotechnology said, \"Overall, the study was well conducted and controlled with substantial amount of in vitro and in vivo data to support that the newly developed As@Fn as a novel ferritin-based As nanomedicine is efficacious to treat diverse human leukemia.\" Explore further",

    "pubDate": "2021-10-25 15:00:00",
    "full_description": "Every genre of story has its standing tropes. Westerns have black hats and white hats, face-offs between lone gunmen standing in the middle of otherwise deserted streets, and nearly mandatory shots of wide-open vistas under bright blue skies. Rom-coms have obligatory meet-cutes and post-blow-up reconciliations. Murder mysteries have their quirky detectives who make unlikely connections, noir stories have their femmes fatales and grievous setbacks for hardbitten heroes, musicals have their \u201cI Wish\u201d declarations of intent and their supposedly spontaneous choreography. In any genre you can name, there are long-established patterns for efficient, effective storytelling, and creators who have to decide whether to subvert those expectations, or give longtime fans of the genre what they\u2019ve been trained to want to see. But horror is the most trope-driven genre of fiction out there. It\u2019s hard to name a single horror story or movie or TV show that doesn\u2019t either draw on some form of familiar, longstanding trope, or establish one that\u2019s subsequently been copied over and over. Horror is constantly being reinvented and redesigned, and it\u2019s the genre that evolves fastest in response to every new cultural, social, or technological shift. But it\u2019s still a genre of recurrence, of traceable and echoing patterns that link the first spooky stories told around a campfire to the nonstop barrage of cheap, enthusiastic indie films pouring onto streaming services today. There\u2019s a fundamental reason for that. And given what a wide field horror has become, and how hugely horror stories vary, it\u2019s a counterintuitive reason. At its bloody, dripping heart, horror is about manipulating human fear to thrill and unsettle an audience. And humanity is really only afraid of a few basic things. Most people, if pressed, could lay out at least a few things they\u2019re afraid of, whether they\u2019re physical things like spiders or violent strangers, or more abstract possibilities, like unemployment or publicly humiliation. Horror stories similarly lay out a thousand scary scenarios, from the plausible (getting lost in the woods) to the possible but only remotely likely (getting eaten by a shark) to the downright impossible. (As much as M. Night Shyamalan wants people watching The Happening to be frightened by the wind spreading malevolent pheromones that make people spontaneously impale themselves on whatever comes to hand, that isn\u2019t exactly a common occurrence.) But virtually all human fears come down to two baseline terrors, and the first one is the biggest, darkest, and most far-reaching: the fear of the unknown. Nothing unnerves people like the understanding that they might have to deal with something they don\u2019t have the experience or tools to deal with. And while horror stories put a thousand faces on that fear, after a while \u2014 after enough experience with the genre \u2014 all of those faces start to look like the bones underneath them. \u201cFear of the unknown\u201d can be splintered and reskinned in many, many ways to give horror stories their specificity. People are afraid of death, because they can only guess at what comes afterward. They\u2019re afraid of the dark, because it has the potential to hide just about anything they could imagine. They\u2019re afraid of newly created things, because the possible downsides haven\u2019t fully been established yet. (Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein is effectively a scary story about the possible horrors electricity could bring to society, which is something we don\u2019t worry about much anymore \u2014 we\u2019ve moved on to making horror movies fussing over whether the internet might make ghosts better at murdering us .) And on an atavistic level that\u2019s just another form of \u201cfear of death,\u201d people are afraid of being prey instead of predators. Which is why so many horror stories feature things that want to eat us, from real-world animals to creatures out of folklore, from our own ill-advised scientific creations to unknown critters from other worlds. Beyond the basic survival questions of what wants to devour us , lay eggs in us , or just kill us for fun, we\u2019re afraid of the unknowns inherent in our own bodies. Science doesn\u2019t fully understand how the human brain works, or how to fix it when something goes wrong. So we have an endless array of exploitative and paranoid movies about insanity, which can run the gamut from complicated cultural commentaries like American Psycho to mad-slasher movies like the Halloween and Friday the 13th franchises, where \u201cinsane\u201d is synonymous with \u201cmurderous, implacable, and nearly invulnerable.\u201d We\u2019re similarly afraid of what happens if our bodies break down in ways we can\u2019t predict or control, which drives fear-of-aging movies like Shyamalan\u2019s Old and The Visit , stories about fast-spreading diseases like Stephen King\u2019s The Stand , and body-snatchers stories where something unknown has the power to steal our shapes and identities. We\u2019re also terrified of what happens if someone else damages our bodies, leading to decades of increasingly graphic horror stories about kidnappers and torturers, sadists and rapists, serial killers and mad scientists. Other people are a constant source of unknowns. Even with your nearest and dearest, you can never actually directly access what someone else is thinking. It\u2019s a short jump from there to the knee-jerk fear of anything that looks or acts human enough to fool people, but has a secret face and a secret agenda, and might sidle up to us in a tempting way. Vampires, fairy-tale shapeshifters, and Scarlett Johansson\u2019s alluring hunter-alien in Under the Skin are all just extreme ways of expressing our fears that our trust in other people might be misplaced, and that we might drop our guards around someone (or something) with ill intent. Even the most innovative horror films of the last decade ultimately fold into that basic, fundamental fear of the unknown. The adversary in It Follows is scary because it\u2019s incredibly strong, implacable, and deeply malevolent, and because it always looks like someone its victim knows, until it attacks. But above all, it\u2019s scary because no one knows what it is, or how to stop it. The titular creature in The Babadook is unnerving because of its eerie presentation and the mysteries around what it is and what it wants \u2014 and even when those questions seem to be answered, it still represents the fundamental unknowability of people. Hereditary is full of shocks that push the envelope on viewers\u2019 discomfort, but it\u2019s ultimately about people with hidden agendas that the protagonists don\u2019t know about, and don\u2019t know how to counter, until it\u2019s too late. Scratch just about any horror movie\u2019s surface, and the blood beneath it is just that old fear of the unknown, hiding under a new and elaborate skin. But fear of the unknown is only half of the big picture of horror tropes. The only other baseline terror that matches it, in terms of getting to the root of horror stories, is the fear of isolation. Not only are we afraid of facing something we don\u2019t understand, we\u2019re afraid we might have to do it alone. Most people grow up with at least some level of societal conditioning that says there are structures in place to protect, guide, and guard us. Life experience may give us plenty of reasons to be cynical about how much the government, the police, our teachers and bosses and parents, or any other designated authority can or will help us when we\u2019re in trouble. But even so, horror stories are strongest when they cut out even the possibility of that appeal to authority. Horror creators have found chilling ways to exploit the threat and dread of isolation, from early Gothic conventions, like sending a character off to a distant country house to live among strangers , to modern ones, like unplugging a character\u2019s phone every time he tries to charge it. More futuristic horror allows a variety of new ways to isolate people: The fear behind Alien \u2019s tagline, \u201cIn space, no one can hear you scream,\u201d is the implication that the victims are literal light-years from comfort or help. Remote cabins in the woods, defunct and abandoned carnivals or farms or ghost towns \u2014 they\u2019re all tropes because they all represent different kinds of isolation. The cops who dismiss the protagonist as hysterical, the mayor who refuses to close the beaches after the shark attacks, the mentor who gets body-snatched first and lures other people to their doom \u2014 they\u2019re all tropes because they help shut down any sense that protection or rescue is an option. Humans are social animals, and we have the same sense as any other pack creature that there\u2019s safety in numbers, and danger in being left behind for whatever predators follow. But there are only so many ways to isolate people, just as there are only so many ways to depict the unknown. So horror constantly returns to long-established ideas and time-tested images , because the well of fears that are universal enough to unnerve a mass audience only runs so deep. Finding a new way into these basic ideas presents a huge challenge for horror creators, given what a crowded and heavily mined field horror has become. That\u2019s the threat of walking on well-trod ground: If a given book, game, film, or show doesn\u2019t live up to the best examples of the genre, there\u2019s a cadre of horror fans who are all too eager to loudly sigh and point at some previous example that did the trope better. But the huge library of established horror tropes represents an opportunity, too. For one thing, horror\u2019s heavy use of tropes means that creators can draw on the successes of everyone who worked the terror mines before them. People watching a great horror movie aren\u2019t necessarily frightened solely by what\u2019s onscreen. Their memories of how badly similar stories have ended for other characters help build the tension. One reason film-franchise killers like Michael Myers , Jason Voorhees , Jigsaw , or Pinhead still keep viewers on the edge of their seats is because they know exactly what happens to most of the unlucky people who encounter them. When a knife-wielding slasher stalks a victim in a horror game, or characters in a ghost story start feeling an unexplained chill , or the words \u201cDay One\u201d ominously appear onscreen in a zombie movie, horror audiences feel a frission of anticipation, because they know what\u2019s coming \u2014 they just don\u2019t know when, or how bad it\u2019ll get. Even for creators drawing on the exact same trope \u2014 say, that fear of shark attacks, and of being eaten \u2014 there\u2019s still room for an infinite variety of tones and themes, approaches and angles. World-building and character-framing can turn one shark story into a heightened classic like Jaws , another into a giddy thriller like Deep Blue Sea , and a third into a muddled middle-ground movie like Great White . Horror stories\u2019 effectiveness generally don\u2019t come from which tropes they use, so much as how well they build stories around them. It\u2019s also well worth remembering that most of the greatest and most memorable horror stories mix and match tropes, taking advantage of the infinite number of combinations. Stephen King\u2019s IT isn\u2019t just an evil-clown story. Its monster is also a shapeshifter and mind-reader, an inhuman thing that can look as human as it needs to be in order to prey on the most vulnerable and isolated people it can find. The Thing isn\u2019t just an alien story, it\u2019s a bodysnatcher movie and a study in isolation and \u201cWho can you trust?\u201d paranoid dynamics. The Exorcist is about an unknowable and powerful entity, but it\u2019s also about loss of innocence, loss of physical control, loss of faith, and the gross-out factor of being covered in green vomit. And so forth and so on. Horror stories all come from the simplest promise: We\u2019re going to scare you. It\u2019s exciting to be afraid for a little while, and then remember that you were safe all along. More often than not, fulfilling that promise means drawing on some of the tools that always work, and always have worked, even if the details change over time. But there\u2019s a darker, more complex promise running under the genre: We don\u2019t ever have to worry about running out of stories that scare us, because we\u2019re always going to be scared of the same two things. We can never know everything, and we can never escape the ways in which we\u2019re alone. That\u2019s bad news for humanity, maybe, but it\u2019s great for horror creators. They may have to go back to the same well over and over for scares, but it\u2019s a deep, dark well, and it\u2019s one we\u2019re never really going to be able to fill.",

    "full_description": "There are certain tropes and symbols that recur throughout horror fiction \u2014 undead creatures , restless spirits , uncontrollable transformations . They tap into the part of the human brain that needs explanations and hates ambiguity. So it\u2019s not surprising that mirrors, those image-flipping sheets of silvered glass, land on that list. Even on a good day, there\u2019s something unsettling about your reflection, and fright flicks throughout the years have pulled out mirrors for all manner of scares. In the spirit of accuracy, I recently watched every movie I could find with an evil or supernatural mirror and ranked them by how well those mirrors worked. This includes possessed mirrors, mirrors as portals to bad places, mirrors that create monsters, and even a few uncategorizable entries. These rankings don\u2019t reflect the movies themselves, only the mirror scenes, so let\u2019s get reflecting. The Paranormal Activity series taps into nearly every overused horror trope, so it\u2019s not surprising that malevolent mirrors have taken a turn in the found footage barrel. In the third installment, two people videotape themselves playing \u201cBloody Mary\u201d in the bathroom, but (after a fake-out) a malevolent spirit is released that scratches the older one and causes a ruckus outside. We don\u2019t see anything in the mirror itself, because we never see anything in any of these movies, so this one barely counts. One of the best-known tall tales around mirrors is Bloody Mary, where if you chant her name three times in front of a mirror she will materialize and murder you. This direct-to-DVD flick posits Mary as a murdered high school girl in 1969, who pops up in 2004 after being summoned by a group of outcasts and goes on a murder spree. There\u2019s not a whole lot of mirror action here. The portals in this 2002 effort appear in numerous locations, but one of them is a bathroom mirror so here we go. Four people afflicted by night terrors discover that they\u2019re actually being tormented by mysterious creatures from another dimension who breach into our world when they sleep. Not a lot to recommend with this one but a decent mirror scene nonetheless. When a mirror from the cursed house in the first Amityville Horror winds up in a boarding house (through an absurdly convoluted series of events), it brings with it a demon that leaves its reflective prison to take on other forms and murder the residents. In this mediocre 2005 hoodoo movie set in a decrepit Louisiana plantation, a young hospice aide takes a job looking after the elderly inhabitants of the house. She soon discovers that two former slaves have been using their magic to hop into new bodies, entrapping people through a full-length mirror that transplants their personas. It\u2019s not anything special, but it\u2019s an evil mirror so it counts. The Mothman legend we all know and love is that of a mysterious cryptid who hangs out in the West Virginia boonies. But in this straight-to-DVD stinker, our boy is repurposed as a spirit summoned by a Native American chief named \u201cCornstalk\u201d that can only enter our reality through reflective surfaces. What exactly this has to do with the Mothman is up for interpretation. The malevolent spirit that manifests as Pennywise loves himself a carnival, so there\u2019s naturally a hall of mirrors scene . When Bill charges into the funhouse to keep the clown from feasting on another child, he gets trapped in a hallucinatory maze of reflections that baffles and delays him long enough for It to get another meal. Are these mirrors supernatural and evil or physical and just annoying? Hard to tell, but we\u2019ll give them the benefit of the doubt. There\u2019s only a brief mirror bit in this 1980 Canadian psychological horror entry, but it\u2019s done well. When a composer mourning the death of his wife and daughter moves to a Seattle mansion, he is assailed by supernatural forces until he unravels a mystery that stretches back almost a hundred years. One of the incidents involves a mirror shattering into his face, and it\u2019s a short, sharp scare that works great. In general, partying in an abandoned mortuary isn\u2019t recommended. When a group of teens breaks into Hull House and holds a seance, a demon appears in a mirror and then breaks out of the crematorium that\u2019s been holding it. It\u2019s a very brief scene, all things considered, but getting the first peek at the creature is something special. Typically the childhood scourge of bedtime comes out from the closet or under the bed, but in this 1980 horror cheapie the Boogeyman is actually the ghost of a woman\u2019s dead boyfriend trapped in the mirror he was stabbed to death in front of \u2026 by her son. Oedipus much? Anyways, 20 years later the spirit comes back for vengeance in increasingly bizarre ways wherever even a small piece of the broken mirror is found. British studio Amicus Productions knocked out horror anthologies at a steady clip throughout the \u201960s and \u201970s, with this one being its final effort. In From Beyond The Grave , a quartet of customers of an antique shop find themselves cursed by their purchases. The first segment stars David Warner as a man who purchases an antique mirror and is captivated by the spirit within to murder people until it builds the strength to leave its reflective prison. There are no paranormal elements to the mirror in this 1960 thriller, but it\u2019s certainly evil enough to snag a place here. Carl Boehm plays a photographer who murders women, using a round mirror mounted on the top of his camera so they can see their own faces as they die. At the end of the film, he drives his knife into himself, capturing his demise as the grand finale of his project. Two travelers swap ghost stories around a campfire in this Western horror oddity made on a shoestring budget in the Mojave Desert, shot by Janusz Kami\u0144ski, who would go on to shoot Schindler\u2019s List . The fourth tale is about a gunman, played by Scott Paulin, who kills a rival in a shootout but is then haunted by his ghost. In one notable scene, he\u2019s shaving with a straight razor when he spots the apparition in the mirror as it grips his arm and tries to force him to slash his own throat. When an American family moves into a rural English manor, one of the daughters starts seeing the apparition of a blindfolded girl in the house\u2019s mirrors. It turns out she was the victim of a ritual gone wrong that swapped her with a mysterious creature from another dimension, and now can only communicate through reflective surfaces. This doesn\u2019t have the bombast of the John Milius original, but it\u2019s more colorful and weird. One of the best bits comes when Conan is forced to battle a gross monster in a hall of mirrors, defeating it by shattering the glass around him. It\u2019s then revealed that the beast was the wizard Thoth-Amon in disguise, played by pro wrestler Pat Roach. The fourth installment in the long-running franchise saw director Kevin Yagher pull his name off the finished film to have \u201c Alan Smithee \u201d take the credit, so you know it has to be good. Wait, no, it\u2019s not. That said, the movie is full of mirrors, and it includes one memorable scene where the cenobite Angelique pulls a man through a mirror and decapitates him, leaving his headless corpse to plop to the floor with a sticky thump. The 2010 reboot of Wes Craven\u2019s franchise is perfectly fine, but not all that necessary. It does have one great mirror scare at the end, though, as Jackie Earl Haley\u2019s Freddy stabs through the reflective surface to kill Nancy\u2019s mother and pull her into the dream world. It\u2019s a better version of a similar effect from the original, which used an unconvincing blow-up doll pulled through a window. James Wan\u2019s 2013 franchise-starter throws a lot of stuff at the walls, much in the mode of its inspiration Poltergeist . One of the primary methods that the paranormal forces (mustered by the spirit of the witch Bathsheba Sherman) use is a music box with a mirror inlaid in the lid, which also displays the evil doll Annabelle. This 2007 low-budget chiller features a family of three that moves to a Los Angeles house with massive windows and mirrors. The mother, a photographer, soon discovers that anybody she takes a picture of dies horribly. The culprit is the spirit of one of the home\u2019s prior owners, a painter who was betrayed by her husband and possessed by a supernatural force that made her images real. Razor-gloved murder aficionado Freddy Krueger is a creature of dreams, so he loves optical illusions. In the climactic scene of Dream Warriors , Freddy creates a hall of mirrors in Joey\u2019s dream to suck in the team of teens who have hypnotized themselves to confront him. Obviously things don\u2019t work out for them, but Joey finds his voice and screams so loud the mirrors shatter and release our heroes. When a group of quantum physicists become trapped in a Los Angeles monastery while investigating a tube of mysterious green fluid that might be Satan, a frenzy of possession, murder, and other supernatural shenanigans kicks off. The devil\u2019s plan is to summon an even worse dude, the \u201cAnti-God,\u201d into our plane through a mirror, and a few reflective surfaces are shattered in the attempt. The magic mirror in Disney\u2019s Snow White was the progenitor, but this odd 1997 horror flick goes one better. In the reimagining of the famous fairy tale, the mirror itself is the cause of the stepmother\u2019s homicidal impulses. Sigourney Weaver plays Claudia Hoffman, driven by jealousy of her stepdaughter Lilli to use the mirror\u2019s dark gifts to torment and murder. In the movie\u2019s climactic scene, Lilli stabs the mirror itself with a shard of glass, making it explode. Mike Flanagan\u2019s Oculus revolves around a cursed mirror named the Lasser Glass, which has the ability to induce hallucinations when it\u2019s gazed into. When the Russell family encounters it for the first time, it leads to the deaths of parents Alan and Marie. 11 years later, the surviving children must contend with the mirror\u2019s eldritch effects as they try to prove that it killed their parents. When teenage goth Megan Gordon moves to Iowa from Los Angeles in this 1990 flick, there\u2019s not much she likes about her new house except for a huge, ornate mirror. Bad news! There\u2019s a demon in it, which starts messing with her bullies and, eventually, killing people. Megan rolls with it, but when her mother gets mangled in the garbage disposal she turns against her reflective friend and eventually sacrifices herself to stop it. This 2008 horror movie gets right to it in the title. A night security guard at a burned-out department store is tormented by visions in the many mirrors still standing, but inside them is a demon that manifested when the building was a psychiatric hospital, or something. It\u2019s a pretty huge mess but there are a lot of clever scares and reflective effects to enjoy, so it ranks decently. This 1986 cult classic has a rep for its innovative and effective effects. When horror author Roger Cobb moves into his dead aunt\u2019s house, he finds himself tormented by Vietnam flashbacks as well as spiritual shenanigans. One of the hubs for these events is the mirrored bathroom medicine cabinet, which Roger breaks with a footstool to reveal an infinite void full of nasties. The direct-to-DVD sequel is actually better than the first film. It takes us back to the haunted department store, but this time the malevolent spirit is a young female employee who was drugged and murdered at the store\u2019s grand opening party, and buried in the basement. Now her ghost is looking to get revenge on the men responsible in a number of pretty solid mirror kill scenes. There are so many great scenes in this movie, but the bit where protagonist David Kessler is in the bathroom and gets the hell scared out of him when his dead friend Jack appears to him in the mirror is an all-timer. Like the rest of the film, it\u2019s simultaneously hilarious and horrifying, as Jack\u2019s state of decay is conveyed with tremendous Rick Baker makeup. Cracking a mirror is an omen of bad luck, especially in 2008\u2019s The Broken . In that movie, doppelgangers identical to regular people but with the positions of their internal organs reversed enter our world through shattering reflections. They proceed to murder the originals for unknown reasons. Great paranoia vibe in this one, along with a lot of breaking glass. One of the earliest films on this list, this surprisingly good 1945 horror anthology has a segment built around a cursed mirror that belonged to a cuckolded husband. The man suspected his wife of cheating on him and killed her before slitting his own throat in front of the mirror. Its new owner then became possessed by the spirit of the glass and nearly duplicated the crime before the mirror was shattered. Tobe Hooper\u2019s 1982 horror classic is relentlessly innovative in the ways it torments the Freeling family and the people in their orbit. One of the most memorable scenes involves Dr. Marty Casey, an investigator called in to help figure out what\u2019s wrong with the house. Alone at night, he stops in the kitchen for a snack and sees maggots spawning from meat. He then runs to the utility room to wash his face only to see his own flesh peeling from his face in a grisly display. It\u2019s a sharp, effective bit. This cult classic is best-known for the reflective metal murder balls used by the film\u2019s antagonist the Tall Man, but it has a great evil mirror scene as well. In the movie\u2019s coda, as our surviving hero Mike is getting ready to pack up and leave town, the presumably deceased Tall Man appears in Mike\u2019s bedroom mirror, thrusting his hands through the glass and pulling Mike inside. It\u2019s a great bit that perfectly fits in with the dreamlike logic of the movie. Based on a Clive Barker short story, the Candyman is a malevolent spirit that haunts Chicago\u2019s Cabrini-Green housing projects, summoned by having his name chanted five times into a mirror. The movie\u2019s prime mirror scare comes right at the end, as Virginia Madsen\u2019s character has her own name used to summon her for revenge. Richard Marquand\u2019s 1978 directorial debut is a fascinating little Gothic horror tale about a Los Angeles couple summoned to a British mansion where the decaying lord of the manor has assembled his heirs. Things aren\u2019t quite what they seem, of course, and a spectral force starts murdering them in entertaining ways. The movie\u2019s mirror scene is a really good one, with the reflecting glass exploding into a deadly spray of shards that impales a woman, then reassembles itself. The original Poltergeist has one very good mirror scare, but the second sequel is built around reflections almost all the way through. It\u2019s certainly not as good a movie, but the myriad uses of mirrors and surfaces to show the spirit world and the machinations of the evil Henry Kane are excellent, letting it rank higher on this list. Great practical effects by Cal Acord still look convincing today. This 2003 Korean horror film was the inspiration for Mirrors , but a bunch of stuff changed along the way. A police officer traumatized from his partner\u2019s death takes a job working security for an abandoned, fire-damaged shopping mall. While the American version of the film trades on jump scares and gore, this one is slower, more contemplative, and significantly more ambitious. Some of the coolest trick mirror shots you\u2019ll ever see are found in this one, so hunt it down. Mirror imagery appears throughout Stanley Kubrick\u2019s all-time horror classic. The Overlook Hotel is full of reflections, from the dead twins tormenting Danny to the mirrors in every scene where Jack interacts with the ghosts. But the most iconic scene comes when Wendy looks into her bedroom mirror to see Danny\u2019s lipstick-scrawled \u201cREDRUM\u201d reversed to \u201cMURDER\u201d on the door. The many supernatural shenanigans that plague Ash Williams across the Evil Dead franchise are too abundant to list, but one of the most iconic comes when he gazes into a mirror inside the cursed cabin and releases an evil doppelg\u00e4nger of himself. Sam Raimi is a master of camera cuts and practical effects, so this low-tech scene still feels real and surprising decades later.",

    "full_description": "Former Facebook data scientist turned whistleblower Frances Haugen on Monday told lawmakers in the United Kingdom working on legislation to rein in social media companies that the company is making online hate and extremism worse and outlined how it could improve online safety. Haugen appeared before a parliamentary committee scrutinizing the British government's draft legislation to crack down on harmful online content, and her comments could help lawmakers beef up the rules. She's testifying the same day that Facebook is set to release its latest earnings and that The Associated Press and other news organisations started publishing stories based on thousands of pages of internal company documents she obtained. Haugen told U.K. lawmakers how Facebook Groups amplifies online hate, saying algorithms that prioritize engagement take people with mainstream interests and push them to the extremes. She said the company could add moderators to prevent groups from being used to spread extremist views. Unquestionably, it's making hate worse, she said. Haugen added that she was shocked to hear recently that Facebook wants to double down on the metaverse and that they're gonna hire 10,000 engineers in Europe to work on the metaverse, Haugen said, referring to the company's plans for an immersive online world it believes will be the next big internet trend. I was like, Wow, do you know what we could have done with safety if we had 10,000 more engineers?' It would be amazing, she said. It's her second appearance before lawmakers after she testified in the U.S. Senate earlier this month about the danger she says the company poses, from harming children to inciting political violence and fueling misinformation. Haugen cited internal research documents she secretly copied before leaving her job in Facebook's civic integrity unit. The documents, which Haugen provided to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, allege Facebook prioritised profits over safety and hid its own research from investors and the public. Some stories based on the files have already been published, exposing internal turmoil after Facebook was blindsided by the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot and how it dithered over curbing divisive content in India, and more is to come. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has disputed Haugen's portrayal of the company as one that puts profit over the well-being of its users or that pushes divisive content, saying a false picture is being painted. But he does agree on the need for updated internet regulations, saying lawmakers are best able to assess the tradeoffs. Haugen has told U.S. lawmakers that she thinks a federal regulator is needed to oversee digital giants like Facebook, something that officials in Britain and the European Union are already working on. The U.K. government's online safety bill calls for setting up a regulator that would hold companies to account when it comes to removing harmful or illegal content from their platforms, such as terrorist material or child sex abuse images. This is quite a big moment, Damian Collins, the lawmaker who chairs the committee, said ahead of the hearing. This is a moment, sort of like Cambridge Analytica, but possibly bigger in that I think it provides a real window into the soul of these companies. Collins was referring to the 2018 debacle involving data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica, which gathered details on as many as 87 million Facebook users without their permission. Representatives from Facebook and other social media companies plan to speak to the committee Thursday. Ahead of the hearing, Haugen met the father of Molly Russell, a 14-year-old girl who killed herself in 2017 after viewing disturbing content on Facebook-owned Instagram. In a chat filmed by the BBC, Ian Russell told Haugen that after Molly's death, her family found notes she wrote about being addicted to Instagram. Haugen also is scheduled to meet next month with European Union officials in Brussels, where the bloc's executive commission is updating its digital rulebook to better protect internet users by holding online companies more responsible for illegal or dangerous content. Under the U.K. rules, expected to take effect next year, Silicon Valley giants face an ultimate penalty of up to 10% of their global revenue for any violations. The EU is proposing a similar penalty. The U.K. committee will be hoping to hear more from Haugen about the data that tech companies have gathered. Collins said the internal files that Haugen has turned over to U.S. authorities are important because it shows the kind of information that Facebook holds and what regulators should be asking when they investigate these companies. The committee has already heard from another Facebook whistleblower, Sophie Zhang, who raised the alarm after finding evidence of online political manipulation in countries such as Honduras and Azerbaijan before she was fired.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin I am a big fan of Zoho, not just because it relocated the corporate headquarters to my hometown of Austin, Texas but frankly because I happen to believe that a full stack software-as-a-service (SaaS) enterprise play is the way of the future. Back in March of last year, I published an article introducing Zoho as \"the most successful SaaS company you may have never heard of. \" In April, I reviewed Qntrl (pronounced \"control\"), a simple workflow automation solution. In July of this year, I followed up with Zoho's BI And Analytics Suite review. Today I would like to cover Zoho One. Launched in 2017, Zoho One is a suite of business applications designed to address every aspect of the business, cleverly described as the \"operating system for business.\" In this article, I will cover the customer reaction to Zoho One and then dive into the new features added to the suite in the recent release this October 2021. Zoho Zoho SaaS is where the puck is going Many of you that read my articles will know I have cited many examples of enterprises that have successfully moved back-office finance, human resources, and supply chain applications into software-as-a-service (SaaS) cloud solutions. The cloud model offers several benefits, including offloading application management and updates to the vendor and having a subscription model tied to resource usage. Also, updates in the SaaS model are instantly available to all; cool new features evaluated quickly, nothing to download, and nothing to install. Customers have peace of mind knowing technology is up to date. MORE FOR YOU Western Digital\u2019s Journey To Build Business Resiliency Through Cloud And ERP Transformation Amazon Climate Pledge: Two Years In And Going Strong Microsoft Takes First Steps To Finally Kill The Password I maintain it is easier to deliver superior customer engagement and operational excellence when your enterprise applications are on a unified platform. Compared to a \"best of breed\" path, a unified approach to software cuts down on customization costs and complex integrations. As organizations turn to big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence applications supported in the cloud to do the number-crunching, a unified platform with a single data source and reporting solution is preferred. Finally, unified systems offer greater security. There will be clear hierarchies within a SaaS environment to facilitate consistent governance, business processes, approvals, workflows, onboarding, and off-boarding. Zoho One: a unified software solution Zoho One, launched in 2017, includes more than fifty integrated business applications and mobile apps for Android and iOS in one central system accessible through a single sign-on. Zoho recently celebrated its 25 th anniversary and has grown to over ten thousand employees in the last twenty-five years. Zoho has seventy million users in one hundred and eighty different countries. Zoho One has over forty thousand customers, with the largest customer having thirty-two thousand employees. Zoho\u2019s long-term goal has been unification at every level, from the experience to the applications right down to the infrastructure and networks that run in the back end. Over the years, over fifty applications have been added to the suite to handle processes in multiple departments, from marketing to business intelligence finance to communication. New enhancements mindful of the pandemic Customers rely more on digital channels to sell products today. In response, Zoho has released Zoho Commerce to enable customers to grow an online business. Zoho Commerce will build a website, take orders, track inventory, process payments, manage shipping, market the brand, and analyze data within the online store. Zoho has added three new applications to the Zoho One suite to enhance remote collaboration to make it easier to collaborate with a team while working remotely. Zoho Lens is designed for field service technicians to help solve problems faster and reduce on-site visits using augmented reality. Lens is an interactive remote assistance tool for field technicians and customers to join the session via email or text and view the problem in real-time. Zoho Learn is a knowledge and learning management platform designed to help capture and retain the team's expertise, build training programs and measure the training results with features such as article templates, discussion boards, activity timelines, and quizzes. The last remote collaboration application is Team Inbox, a shared inbox for teams that eliminates the need for cc\u2019s and duplicate responses and allows people to work together. The final new application in Zoho One is Data Prep. Powered by artificial intelligence (AI), Data Prep discovers errors in data from multiple sources. It will analyze and improve quality, transform and enrich data with language detection and keyword extraction, and catalog data with custom tags to help improve discoverability during a search. New and enhanced services Zoho one has three new services and some significant improvements to existing services. There are over fifteen hundred pre-built reports and dashboards in the business intelligence tool to help synthesize data. From the moment data is in the CRM system, help desk, or even a third-party application, all of that data can be understood and brought into analytics. It is visualized and automatically populated into pre-built reports. Zoho has made it as easy as possible for any customer, regardless of technical abilities, to get reports using natural language processing. Work Graph is a new back-end service that creates a graph mapping out the different connections between an individual, the various contacts, projects, conversations with others across multiple tools like email and chat. It does this by studying signals to build a business-wide work graph that is specific to each individual. The following new service is Mobile Applications Management which allows IT to provision and manage devices remotely. It also includes automatically assigning and installing specific applications to certain users, updating the operating system, and mandating security policies. The third new service is Org Dictionary. It is a unified dictionary for the organization used across all writing pieces and different applications that will become specific to the organization. Any weird names that are not the common language, for example, would automatically add to the org dictionary. A unified user experience Zoho now offers a unified user interface to look and move around all Zoho One applications. Zoho now provides unified navigation, calendar, and dashboard with over 50 pre-built widgets spanning the entire business operations personalized on every user's home screen. These changes improve the overall experience of Zoho One as more streamlined and efficient. Third-party integrations are now unified and can be brought into the Zoho One ecosystem allowing access to all applications, whether Zoho or third party. A customer example A better understanding of the value of Zoho One can be found by listening to customer stories. One such customer is Arctic Spas, a manufacturer of hot and cold tubs. Arctic Spas struggled with a cumbersome customer relationship management (CRM) system that led to problems tracking leads and communications breakdowns internally and with the dealer network. Arctic Spas adopted Zoho\u2019s CRM software in 2013 and progressed to Zoho One in 2018. One of the main attractions of the software suite was the ability to customize and integrate to support the business expansion. With Zoho One, Arctic Spas were able to track leads more closely, improving the customer experience. The software scaled from managing three hundred leads per week to almost a thousand. With Zoho software, internal, external, and customer communication has improved drastically. Applications deployed were: Workdrive , online file management for teams; Connect , a centralized hub for employee communications, corporate resources, and collaboration; CRM; Cliq , group collaboration software; Assist remote support and remote access software; and SalesIQ , a live chat and analytics platform for customer engagement - all working together. Arctic Spas needed a solution to help with communication on all fronts, internal and external, and software that could manage different products, customers, and vendors. Key was the unique versatility and customization offered by Zoho One that made it possible to unify many processes into one system. Wrapping up As we all embrace cloud technologies and emerging technologies in machine learning and cognitive computing, it's essential to consider how these solutions fit into your technology posture. In contrast to traditional on-premise deployments, a unified system in a SaaS model promises to lower costs, encourage better business decision-making, and drive better organizational processes \u2014 things everyone needs in today\u2019s rapidly evolving economy. Zoho is well-positioned with cloud-native applications running on a cloud hardware platform to deliver a full-stack SaaS offering. The concept appears to be working with over forty thousand customers, and the average number of applications used by a customer rising to twenty-one today. Small and medium businesses with a relatively clean slate should evaluate Zoho. There will always be a certain amount of stickiness in larger organizations as a software transition involves a monumental amount of work and data to import. Zoho has recognized the resistance to change and has built an integration with many third-party applications. In some cases, the willingness to play with other applications has led to the eventual transition to Zoho software. I believe Zoho has the right product that addresses where the puck is going, which is pretty exciting. Whenever I meet with Zoho, I consider switching all my software over to Zoho; I think that day is fast approaching. The best part is that I don\u2019t have to shift over everything, just what I need.

In its annual report on heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere , the United Nations weather agency also pointed to signs of a worrying new development: Parts of the Amazon rainforest have gone from being a carbon \"sink\" that sucks carbon dioxide from the air to a source of CO2 due to deforestation and reduced humidity in the region, it said.

Many environmental activists, policymakers and scientists say the Oct. 31-Nov. 12 event, known as COP26 for short, marks an important and even crucial opportunity for concrete commitments to the targets set out in the 2015 Paris climate accord. Have questions about COP26 or climate science, policy or politics? Email us: ask@cbc.ca. Your input helps inform our coverage. \"The Greenhouse Gas Bulletin contains a stark, scientific message for climate change negotiators at COP26,\" World Meteorological Organization secretary general Petteri Taalas said of his agency's report. \"At the current rate of increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, we will see a temperature increase by the end of this century far in excess of the Paris agreement targets of 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\" The report draws on information collected by a network that monitors the amount of greenhouse gases that remain in the atmosphere after some quantities are absorbed by oceans and the biosphere. Climate change helps flip Amazon from sink to source of CO2 \"One of the striking messages from our report is that the Amazonian region, which used to be a sink of carbon, has become a source of carbon dioxide,\" Taalas said. \"And that's because of deforestation. It's because of changes of the global local climate, especially. We have less humidity and less rainfall.\" Oksana Tarasova, chief of the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) atmospheric and environment research division, said the results showing the Amazon going from sink to source were a first, but she noted they were from a specific southeastern portion of the Amazon, not the entire rainforest.

The 2020 increase was higher than the annual average over the last decade despite a 5.6 per cent drop in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels due to COVID-19 restrictions, WMO said. Global south suffering gap in climate change research as rich countries drive agenda, studies suggest The world is aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050. Here's what that means Taalas said a level above 400 parts per million \u2014 which was breached in 2015 \u2014 \"has major negative repercussions for our daily lives and well-being, for the state of our planet and for the future of our children and grandchildren.\" Human-incurred CO2 emissions, which result mostly from burning fossil fuels like oil and gas or from cement production, amount to about two-thirds of the warming effect on the climate. WMO said overall, an economic retreat last year because of the pandemic \"did not have any discernible impact on the atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases and their growth rates, although there was a temporary decline in new emissions.\" WATCH | Climate disruptions are guaranteed for decades, UN report says: Climate change affecting every region on Earth, UN report says 3 months ago 1:20 The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns in a report that climate disruptions are guaranteed for decades, if not centuries, due to greenhouse gas levels.

    "full_description": "Chinese publishers NetEase have bought Grasshopper Manufacture, the Japanese studio behind stylish, swaggering games including No More Heroes , The Silver Case , and Killer7 . While NetEase have roots in mobile games, they have been investing in fancier things. Grasshopper say that with NetEase's cash, they plan to release \"three even higher-quality 'Grasshopper Manufacture Games'\" over the next decade. Grasshopper formed in 1998, then were bought by Japanese publishers GungHo Online Entertainment in 2013. Now they're owned by NetEase. \"NetEase Games understands the strengths of Grasshopper Manufacture Inc. and is willing to support us, and is an extremely reliable partner,\" Grasshopper founder and CEO Goichi Suda (aka Suda51) said in Friday's announcement . \"NetEase Games will be mainly responsible for advising on our business planning activities and providing sufficient funding for game development. We will be responsible for the creativity and production of games to ensure that we are able to continue to maintain the consistent 'Grasshopper Manufacture flavor' and game quality for which we are known. In addition, we will also receive strong support from the NetEase team composed of thousands of artists and technical experts in terms of game art and quality assurance. We will make the most of this support and strive to offer three even higher-quality 'Grasshopper Manufacture Games' to all gamers in the next ten years.\" The Chinese company were best known for developing mobile games like Diablo Immortal as well as handling local publishing duties for games including Minecraft and Overwatch. They have taken steps into a new direction in recent years, including publishing melee battle royale Naraka: Bladepoint and investing in Quantic Dream . It's also rumoured that they've courted longtime Yakuza director Toshihiro Nagoshi to set up a new team (following that rumour, he did leave Sega , though his next steps are yet unknown). I have a soft spot for Grasshopper and their rude 'tude. They're fully into absurd excess, brash dickheads, gore, cussing, and plots which are both ludicrous and treated completely seriously. Sometimes less fun to play than they are to think about, sadly. But man, Killer7 still looks gorgeous, and I'm still impressed that it parlays mega-edginess into coolness. You need a lot of confidence and commitment to pull that off. Third-person stabber No More Heroes came to PC this year, yonks after its Wii debut, along with its sequel. Our Ed's No More Heroes review liked the vibes but found it samey\u2014and not the same without Wii motion control gestures like furious wanking to recharge Travis's lightsaber. I'd still like to see a PC release for No More Heroes 3, which hit Switch in August with a tale of aliens who try to take over the Earth by riding pop culture's superhero craze.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Samsung Z Flip3 Bespoke Edition Samsung Last week, along with the announcement of the new Apple M1 Pro and M1 Max-based MacBooks and Google's Pixel 6 devices with its Tensor chip, Samsung held its Unpacked Part 2 event where it announced new designs of the Galaxy Z Flip3 and some of its accessories. In my coverage of the Galaxy Event Part 1 back in August, I mentioned that I believe the Galaxy Z Flip3 is the most fashionable device on the market with its color options, pocketable size, and outside the screen. There was nothing new announced at the Galaxy Unpacked Event Part 2 in terms of devices or features. The announcements drive home this claim that I made in August and made me even more bullish on the fashionable elements. Its aggressiveness towards appealing to the youth and pop culture pokes at the monopoly that Apple has with its iPhones as the most popular and fashionable device on the market. Let's take a look at what Samsung announced at its Unpacked Event Part 2. Galaxy Z Flip3 Bespoke edition Samsung having special edition devices is nothing new. It has been releasing Thom Browne edition Galaxy devices for quite some time. However, these devices are limited editions and charged at a premium. Samsung announced the Z Flip3 Bespoke edition with customization of different colors on the top and bottom portions of the device. On Samsung's website, users can change the front and back to five different colors interchangeable between colors. Users can also change the color of the hinge and frame to either a silver or an all-black color. The choice of colors is between blue, pink, and yellow or timeless white and black. These colors are different from the Lavender, Phantom Black, and Green colors offered on the customizable version of the Galaxy Z Flip3. The Galaxy Z Flip3 with blue on the front, pink on the bottom, and black for the frame. Samsung It is also worth noting that the Bespoke edition is not charged at a premium and is the same price as the customizable version of the device. If there is one, the kicker is that the Bespoke edition is only available on Samsung's website through the Bespoke Studio. Samsung says it is an engaging experience that provides a 360-degree view of all combinations. Samsung also says there are 49 possible combinations between the different frames and five different colors on the front and back. In my experience of using the Galaxy Z Flip3 Bespoke Studio, it is interesting getting to play with all the different colors and combinations. It makes me want to get multiple different colors of the Galaxy Z Flip3. I find it almost hilarious about these customizations that these would be removable covers and interchangeable if it were ten years prior. It would be harder today to create removable backs for these foldable devices, especially with the IPX8 water resistance rating, but that is one of the perks of a case. MORE FOR YOU Western Digital\u2019s Journey To Build Business Resiliency Through Cloud And ERP Transformation Amazon Climate Pledge: Two Years In And Going Strong Microsoft Takes First Steps To Finally Kill The Password Galaxy Watch4 Bespoke edition Samsung also has a Bespoke Studio for the Galaxy Watch4 and Galaxy Watch4 Classic. Similar to the Bespoke Studio for the Galaxy Z Flip3, the Galaxy Watch4 is customizable with different colors for the frame and different colors for the device's band. There are more combinations with the Galaxy Watch4, considering there is the Galaxy Watch4 and Galaxy Watch4 Classic, two sizes for both of those, and then different colors of the watch's frame for each size. The Galaxy Watch4 Classic 42mm and 46mm have Silver and Black frame options. The Galaxy Watch4 44mm has Green, Black, and Silver frame color options, and the Galaxy Watch4 40mm has Black, Pink Gold, and Silver color options. It makes sense that the Classic version has only two color options since it is the more premium of the two and the non-classic version has one extra color option per size. It also makes sense that the Pink Gold is for the smaller 40mm Galaxy Watch4 for women, and the Green is for the larger 44mm Galaxy Watch4 for men who have larger wrists. Interestingly, the Samsung did not include color options in the Galaxy Watch4 that matched the Galaxy Z Flip3 Bespoke color palette with blue and yellow. The reason is that the customization of the Galaxy Watch4 is with the metal, not the glass. It would be more difficult to match the colors of the glass of the ZFlip3 and the metal of the Watch4 rather than using the colors of the vanilla Galaxy Z Flip3. It also makes sense since considering the Galaxy Watch4 with the colors that Samsung chose also follow the color pallet of the Galaxy Z Fold3, hence a bigger audience for Samsung. The Info Brick, Basic Dashboard, Weather Center, and Live Wallpaper watch faces for the Galaxy ... [+] Watch4. Samsung Samsung also announced the Galaxy Watch4 updates that bring new watch faces, a new gesture control feature, and enhanced fall detection for the device. The new watch faces are four new customizable faces called the Info Brick, Basic Dashboard, Weather Center, and Live Wallpaper. Users can also have customized watch faces that are live wallpapers or pertain to Samsung Health's step challenges. Samsung has also included more gesture controls and variable sensitivity to its fall detection feature. I think these are all great incremental improvements, and I think the watch faces will be a warm complement to the new Bespoke editions of the Galaxy Z Flip3 and the Galaxy Watch4. Maison Kitsun\u00e9 Edition of the Galaxy Watch4 and Buds2 Along with the Bespoke editions of the Galaxy Z Flip3 and the Galaxy Watch4, Samsung introduced the Maison Kitsun\u00e9 Edition of the Galaxy Watch4 and the Buds2. Samsung says it brings the Paris-meets-Tokyo lifestyle's playfulness into the Samsung Galaxy.

Samsung The Maison Kitsun\u00e9 Edition of the Galaxy Watch4 and the Buds2 with matching watch faces and phone wallpaper. Source Samsung Although these are not my taste in design, I think it reaches into Samsung's ability to offer fashionable devices. Samsung is consistent in releasing limited edition devices that target fashionable markets, and I think the Maison Kitsun\u00e9 Edition is a nice addition. Wrapping up I think the Bespoke edition of the Galaxy Z Flip3 and the Galaxy Watch4 could be popular for those who buy from the Samsung website. I think Samsung is doing a good job of making devices customizable to its consumers, and this customization is not seen on other devices like the iPhone. I also think you could argue that people put cases on phones anyway, so it doesn't matter. There is some truth to that, but consumers still purchase devices based on colors. I even think that the Galaxy Z Flip is in a specific position in its design, not to need a case for durability. It's not huge and clunky when closed. For that reason, I think rocking the device without a case with customized colors brings a lot of personalization, and that is exactly what Samsung is going for.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Chief Executive Officer of Ad Astra Media and Chief Health Officer of Ever Medical Technologies. getty One of the biggest buzzwords being thrown around the field of medical technology is \u201cblockchain.\u201d This is for good reason. Simply put, blockchain holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare. With its full deployment, patients can be truly focused on at the center of all operations, which in turn will also be entirely overhauled with better security, privacy and accessibility. But how exactly does blockchain enable all this? How is the health industry fully utilizing this vastly capable cutting-edge technology? What Is Blockchain? First, let\u2019s dive deeper into what blockchain really is. A blockchain is a distributed system that generates and stores data records. It maintains a digital ledger of connected \u201cblocks\u201d of information that represent how data is shared, changed or accessed on its peer-to-peer network. All devices on the same blockchain system will generate identical blocks when a connected device is involved in any kind of transaction. If one computer\u2019s data is accessed, changed, shared or otherwise manipulated in any way, a block is generated to locally record that information on every device. This way, changes to data can be easily identified. It\u2019s a decentralized approach that allows data parity to be achieved by comparing every connected device\u2019s blocks. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event On top of simply recording and comparing data is the utilization of \u201chashing.\u201d Hashing gives every block a unique identifier that changes based on its contents. If a block\u2019s data were to change, so would its hash. This is important because blocks are stored together in chronological order and also directly reference the preceding block\u2019s hash. Therefore, trying to change the data of one block would immediately cause a succeeding block to identify a hash change. It is for this reason that connected blocks form a \u201cchain\u201d securely wrought in an immutable, reliable, decentralized manner. Accurate, secure and a catalyst for utmost accountability, blockchain makes it almost impossible to mimic, manipulate or otherwise falsify data. This opens the doors to many possibilities \u2014 chief of all being the exchange, storage and access of data between connected parties. How Blockchain Is Affecting The Medical Industry Being open and highly secure means blockchain can be applied to the medical industry in a variety of ways, leading to immensely reduced costs and new ways for patients to access healthcare. Combined with the compounding nature of data and innovation, futureproofing technologies can be further applied to foster an era of growth and innovation. Already, pioneering companies are laying the foundations for a blockchain revolution. Here\u2019s how they\u2019re transforming the medical industry. Chronicled The medical industry has suffered greatly from the inability to securely share and access sensitive patient data. Blockchain, however, will facilitate finely customizable openness while upholding only the best security standards for true interoperability. In turn, this will allow health information systems to work together within and across organizational boundaries in order to advance the effective delivery of healthcare for individuals and communities. Chronicled utilizes blockchain technology in its MediLedger Network to bring together trading partners and medical institutions closer than ever before. Without the constant threat of communicative and organizational mishaps, room for much greater innovation and industry development has been created. From the automation of once-hectic processes to greater accountability from all parties, blockchain enables a new world of trust and collaboration. Curisium Acquired in 2020 by HealthVerity, Curisium employed blockchain to create a platform for rebate negotiation and contract management. Everyone in healthcare knows how complex contract negotiations can get, not just in discussion but in how time-consuming and cumbersome they can be. By creating a system that streamlines this process, Curisium allows providers and payers to take part in innovative contracting arrangements that are efficient and secure. All in all, HealthVerity\u2019s acquisition has resulted in the extensive customization and seamless automation of workflows to enable expanded opportunities for collaboration and cost-savings across all parties. Ever Built from the ground up with the goal of fostering innovation, Ever, where I serve as the chief health officer, has an EHR solution that can be quickly and readily applied even to existing hospital networks. Connecting over 170 hospitals and 5 million patients, the Ever Network provides an integrated but modular suite of software that features secured and trustless data exchanges, big data collection and analysis, and machine-learning/artificial intelligence-powered tools and features. Established in 2017, Ever has modernized and equipped Thailand\u2019s medical landscape with a blockchain, data-driven, patient-centric network. It enables best-in-class security for all connected data and parties while maintaining close and easy communication with trusted parties \u2014 all on a flexible, future-proof, scalable blockchain foundation. Patientory Blockchain networks let organizations establish transparency and privacy alike, helping to conceal sensitive patient data while allowing access and sharing when needed. Protected by state-of-the-art security solutions, attackers would require vast computational capabilities to even attempt targeting a blockchain-powered network, severely limiting the frequency, possibility and effectiveness of attacks. Patientory leverages this advantage in the development of patient-centric applications and services, giving the company more control over their well-being. Up-to-date patient histories and data, pandemic tracking and reporting, secure communication with verified healthcare personnel and much more are a reality with their slew of innovative solutions. A Future Alight With Innovation One of the most exciting aspects of blockchain technology is the foundation of growth and modularity that it provides. Though its initial implementation will face the same limitations as today\u2019s technology, blockchain\u2019s open nature will encourage and support industry-wide advancement for years to come. In fact, BIS Research has revealed estimated reports that the immediate application and integration of blockchain in healthcare could save more than $100 billion per year in costs related to IT, operations, support functions, personnel and health data breaches by 2025. While many exciting and creative blockchain solutions have emerged from pioneering companies around the world, this is only the beginning. Join the transformation today and help push the boundaries of medical technology \u2014 all while laying the foundations for a data-driven future that will drive medical breakthroughs at an unprecedented scale.

    "full_description": "An M1 Pro and M1 Max deep dive shows that the new chips don\u2019t just allow the new MacBook Pro models to outclass Windows laptops, but also compete against the best desktop PCs \u2013 something that wasn\u2019t even considered possible for a mobile chip! Making this all the more remarkable is the fact that the actual CPU cores appear to be the same ones found in the base-level M1 chip; it\u2019s just that everything else is better. AnandTech confirmed its suspicion that the cores are the same ones found in the base M1 chip. We had indicated in our initial coverage that it appears that Apple\u2019s new M1 Pro and Max chips is using a similar, if not the same generation CPU IP as on the M1, rather than updating things to the newer generation cores that are being used in the A15. We seemingly can confirm this, as we\u2019re seeing no apparent changes in the cores compared to what we\u2019ve discovered on the M1 chips. However, that doesn\u2019t mean the only difference is in the number of them. First, Apple pushes the cores harder. The CPU cores clock up to 3228MHz peak, however vary in frequency depending on how many cores are active within a cluster, clocking down to 3132 at 2, and 3036 MHz at 3 and 4 cores active. I say \u201cper cluster\u201d, because the 8 performance cores in the M1 Pro and M1 Max are indeed consisting of two 4-core clusters, both with their own 12MB L2 caches, and each being able to clock their CPUs independently from each other, so it\u2019s actually possible to have four active cores in one cluster at 3036MHz and one active core in the other cluster running at 3.23GHz. The memory bandwidth is also three times faster. One large feature of both chips is their much-increased memory bandwidth and interfaces \u2013 the M1 Pro features 256-bit LPDDR5 memory at 6400MT/s speeds, corresponding to 204GB/s bandwidth. This is significantly higher than the M1 at 68GB/s, and also generally higher than competitor laptop platforms which still rely on 128-bit interfaces. But the biggest differences are in the graphics capabilities, which is where we also see the greatest difference between the M1 Pro and M1 Max. The M1 Pro models offer twice the performance of the M1, while the M1 Max quadruples the M1 figures. Whereas the original M1 had 8 GPU cores, M1 Pro gets 16, and M1 Max gets 32. Every aspect of these GPUs has been scaled up accordingly \u2013 there are 2x/4x more texture units, 2x/4x more ROPs, 2x/4x the memory bus width, etc [\u2026] The GPU and memory interfaces of the chip are by far the most differentiated aspects of the [Pro versus Max]. On the M1 Max which we tested for today, the GPU is running at up to 1296MHz [\u2026] Apple also doubles up on the memory interfaces, using a whopping 512-bit wide LPDDR5 memory subsystem \u2013 unheard of in an SoC and even rare amongst historical discrete GPU designs. This gives the chip a massive 408GB/s of bandwidth. It also has what appears to be a doubled-up media encoding engine. The overall result, says the site\u2019s Andrei Frumusanu, is something truly incredible. The M1 Pro & Max achieve performance figures that simply weren\u2019t even considered possible in a laptop chip. The chips here aren\u2019t only able to outclass any competitor laptop design, but also competes against the best desktop systems out there, you\u2019d have to bring out server -class hardware to get ahead of the M1 Max \u2013 it\u2019s just generally absurd [\u2026] The combination of raw performance, unique acceleration, as well as sheer power efficiency, is something that you just cannot find in any other platform right now, likely making the new MacBook Pro\u2019s not just the best laptops, but outright the very best devices for the task.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin HP HP Two weeks ago, HP announced its new line of consumer PCs and Monitors for the fall. This year, HP\u2019s lineup of devices considers how often we use video calls and how much it has become a part of our digital lives post Covid-19. I cover many new and innovative technologies that span the digital transformation of the enterprise. Some of the greatest innovations in the enterprise trickle in and make their way to consumers, and hybrid work is one that we will see for a long time. HP\u2019s Fall launch also came at the perfect time, with Windows 11 officially launching this month. Let\u2019s take a look at HP\u2019s new Consumer PCs and Monitors and how they address the new era of hybrid work. HP Spectre x360 16 First on the list of HP\u2019s new launch is the Spectre x360 16-inch 2-in-1 laptop. HP\u2019s first 16-inch Spectre comes with a unique 5MP camera with many new features that adapt to the user. The 5MP camera is an IR camera with support for Windows Hello and new software called HP GlamCam. HP GlamCam is in the HP command center and carries many webcam features that improve the video quality, including a Beauty Mode, Lighting Correction, and an Auto Frame mode. HP made a laptop that addresses many of the new workflows and ways we use our devices. It made a laptop that wears many different hats and can take on many different workloads. I am impressed with the new camera functionalities and, if the camera lives up to its promise, I think it sets a new standard for where webcams should be on laptops. There is a whole other level of versatility having a laptop with a webcam that adapts to the lighting of wherever the user is. The Auto Framing feature is also useful as well. Although it may seem gimmicky, my camera has an auto frame feature, and it is really helpful. Having a portable version of it on the HP Spectre x360 will keep me from missing it when out of the office. The HP Spectre x360 16-inch 2-in-1 in laptop mode, tablet mode, tent mode, and presenter mode. HP It features a 16:10 screen ratio with up to a UHD+ OLED display with a 91% screen-to-body ratio. It also has quad speakers, two of them being upwards-facing speakers, with AI Noise Removal. HP knows how to make good-quality laptop speakers, and I don\u2019t think these will be any different. The Spectre x360 16-inch is Intel Evo certified with up to an 11 th Gen Intel Core i7 processor and NVIDIA RTX 3050 GPU with WiFi 6E. HP says it has a 10% CPU improvement and 17% GPU improvement over the last generation. HP putting an NVIDIA RTX 3050 in a 2-in-1 shows that it is serious about the Spectre x360 being a device that can do it all. Whether browsing the web in tablet mode, presenting in tent mode, or editing a video in laptop mode, this laptop has the power to do it all. On top of its flagship-level specs is its Intel Evo certification, which means it has the stamina. The Spectre x360 16-inch has all its bases covered. I will have to test out the new Spectre x360 myself and see how it stands up to the competition.

HP created the first AiO with a 5K display. It has a 21:9 aspect ratio that HP says has truer black technology that has been factory calibrated with Delta E<2. It has up to an 11 th Gen Intel Core i9 processor with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 graphics. HP says it has 50% faster video editing and 15% faster photo editing than the M1 iMac. If these statistics are true, Apple has a worthy competitor. Not just with performance but also with its immersive display. The Envy 34-inch AiO with its camera on the bottom right corner. HP The HP Envy 340-inch AiO is a premium AiO that has the power and performance for creators with an immersive display. HP showed how the 21:9 screen ratio could be split into a 16:9 window and 5:9 window with Windows 11 snap layouts, which I thought was impressive. It also has a camera that can be magnetically attached to the edge of the display so that creators can place it for different functionality. It also has an adjustable height for comfortability and to create better angles for the camera. The camera has a 5MP camera lens with a 2\u00b5m pixels sensor and 16MP binning. HP didn\u2019t stop at putting a camera on this AiO device. It again covered all its bases by making a camera that can be placed in different locations. HP 11-inch tablet PC The HP 11-inch tablet is another unique device from HP that has a dedicated flip-out camera. It is a high-res 13MP camera and can rotate 235-degrees. The camera flips out on the side of the camera, and the tablet can be horizontal or vertical, allowing the camera to be to the side or above the tablet. However, it creates an asymmetric design when it is on the side. I love that HP has focused on giving the camera multiple use-cases rather than opting for a mediocre camera on the front and a less used camera on the back. I also like how the camera\u2019s wide degree of rotation allows users to share what is in front of them, similar to the Envy 34-inch with its moveable camera. The camera rotates more than 180 degrees. HP 11-inches for a tablet is also a sweet spot for tablets. It is not too small for a full Windows experience and not too large, making for a comfortable hold. The display is a 2.1K display with eye comfort technology. HP\u2019s 11-inch tablet PC is very practical for those who want a tablet and do many video calls or content creation. The HP 11-inch tablet also has a kickstand, keyboard, and pen companion. Newly announced monitors HP also announced two new monitors, the HP U32 4K HDR and the HP M34d WQHD Curved monitor. The HP U32 4K HDR Monitor has a color gamut with 99% sRGB and 98% DCI-P3. HP had in mind creators with making this monitor as well as productivity. 31.5 inches is on the larger side of displays, so combining the large size, the 4K resolution, and the color accuracy, the HP U32 4K monitor should have a wide audience. The HPM34d WQHD Curved monitor has a 34-inch diagonal display with built-in speakers. The monitor has a 178-degree viewing angle with a max refresh rate of 100Hz. 34 inches, again, makes for a large display, and I think its focus with the HPM34d is for creators to have an all-in-one curved monitor for multitasking, entertainment, and creating content. Wrapping up I like the direction that HP is going with its lineup of consumer PCs. I think HP does a really great job every year of listening to consumers and delivering PCs that consumers will enjoy. This year was no different, and HP listened and saw how the main focus for consumers should be quality hybrid work. Consumers use their devices for more than one workflow these days. Whether that is for personal entertainment, hobbies, or work, HP has made personal devices that are both powerful and versatile, and I\u2019m excited to test them out with Windows 11.

Subex helps businesses embrace disruptive changes in the business landscape and succeed with digital trust. getty The popular crime flick Minority Report from 2002 seemed ahead of its time when it portrayed how a computer system could predict when a person is likely to commit a crime, long before they have even thought about it. However, a decade later, the possibilities imagined by the Tom Cruise blockbuster seem real with the emergence of COMPAS, an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that can predict how likely a person is to commit a crime again. The software was widely used across the U.S. until 2016, when a detailed investigation highlighted that the program was biased against a particular race. The problem lay not in the AI algorithm itself but in the data that was fed into it. Because rules are based on data sets in an AI algorithm and can change dynamically based on the data it receives, the challenge of biases in AI algorithms is real. This is typically referred to as the black box problem of AI, which essentially means there is really no clarity on how AI functions, making it challenging for businesses to rely on the system. This is probably the biggest obstacle in the widespread adoption of AI. For AI to gain mass adoption, it needs to be trusted by governments, enterprises and users directly or indirectly impacted by such applications. Building AI Trust Increasingly, AI algorithms are helping enterprises make crucial decisions like loan disbursements, job placements and medical diagnoses, among several others. This means that an AI program that is unreliable can lead to a loss of customers, profits and reputation, as well as lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event So, how do we make AI systems more trustworthy? The answer lies in making it more transparent. By adopting the principles of transparency and explainability, AI systems will eventually choose the right, unbiased algorithms. What this means is that a transparent AI system will be able to answer why it made particular predictions that led to a certain decision or why it avoided making other predictions for a given case. Building explainable AI that enables users to understand why it arrived at that particular result is one way of making it more trustworthy. Explainable AI becomes important for any organization to build trust and confidence in their AI systems. However, explainable or interpretable AI is only one part of enabling trust. There are other concepts such as bias mitigation and performance relevance. The performance of an AI system is as good as the data used to train it, so it needs to be continuously retrained to ensure that it remains fair and free of bias. To ensure this, performance measurements should go beyond statistical measures and include practical business key performance indicators (KPIs). If continuous retraining is not part of the modeling system, the model could become irrelevant. Measuring AI Trust What if AI could have a trust factsheet like food products have nutrition labels or electrical appliances have star ratings for energy efficiency? A clear-cut framework on the measurement of AI trust can have a far-reaching impact in allowing enterprises to make quick decisions over their AI deployments. But what can this framework include? There are four key constructs \u2014 reliability, safety, transparency and responsibility/accountability \u2014 that can act as the pillars of driving AI trust. This is also central to delivering a model that is fair for all target users. Let us discuss each of these pillars in detail and see how they can be used: 1. Reliability: There is always a chance for a misclassification or prediction error. However, a clear indication of the nature of the error provides confidence to the users. AI models that are trained using a user-centric approach are better placed to provide the required performance. When the performance measures also include business KPIs, apart from the statistical analysis, the model\u2019s reliability tends to improve as business needs evolve. 2. Safety: An AI model built on the pillars of fairness, explainability and security helps ensure a transparent and bias-free model. A user-centric approach coupled with extensive testing in several scenarios helps in building a fair model. Even after deployment, the model needs to be constantly monitored and debiased to ensure that the model stays safe and bias-free during the entire life cycle. 3. Transparency: This is a key factor required during the entire AI model\u2019s life cycle to drive better human augmentation, especially when models are monitored for fairness or when model performance deteriorates over the life cycle. A mechanism that provides an explanation and feedback to a model in terms of ground truth will ensure the model remains robust, as well as improves its transparency during its life cycle. 4. Responsibility/Accountability: It is essential to highlight the benefits and impact of AI within a defined boundary. Also, an ethical framework for AI models is needed to enforce data privacy and model security, and maximize a safe user experience, thus enabling digital trust. Trust in AI is not a mythical idea. Deployment of these four critical constructs as part of your AI system can improve trust in AI and enable it to be adopted for large-scale and critical projects without worrying about unintended results.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Google Cloud Google Two weeks ago was busy for us tech analysts, tech events from Google, Apple and Dell. First on the docket was Google Cloud Next\u2014Google\u2019s annual conference for its enterprise customers and developers, held virtually for the second year in a row. There were many announcements to sift through, but this year\u2019s big headlines revolved around Google\u2019s entry into the distributed cloud space, a big data push and the introduction of new AI-enhanced cloud solutions. I was also struck by home many \u201call-in\u201d customers it rolled out. While there isn\u2019t enough time or space to cover everything out of the event, I\u2019ll drill down on several announcements that I found particularly compelling. Google Distributed Cloud When Google first introduced Anthos, I thought it would really lean into it. I got the sense, though, that something was slowing it down and as I saw a litany of AWS Outposts articles come out, I think AWS started to get momentum. Will the latest Anthos announcements make a difference? ON paper, yes, I believe they will. The most significant announcement, in my book, was the launch of Google Distributed Cloud, a portfolio of fully managed hardware and software solutions that Google says will bring the power of Google Cloud to the intelligent edge and data center. Designed specifically for this frontier, Google Distributed Cloud customers will gain access to various Google Cloud services for local processing: databases, machine learning, data analytics and container management. Additionally, Google touts the new offering\u2019s ability to support low-latency edge compute workloads, the modernization of on-prem environments, sensitive workloads with sovereignty requirements and private 5G/LTE solutions. At the heart of Google Distributed Cloud is Anthos, an open-source-based services platform that promises consistent, scalable performance across various environments. These environments include customer data centers and colocation facilities (and their high-stakes security and privacy needs), customer edge (retail stores, factories, branch offices), operator edge (providing access to 5G/LTE services via service provider partners) and Google\u2019s network edge, which includes more than 140 Google network edge locations globally. Google also lined up an excellent roster of partners that will support the service upon its launch, including the likes of Dell, Cisco, HPE and NetApp. The company says that Google Distributed Cloud customers will utilize third-party services from these partners within their dedicated environment. MORE FOR YOU Western Digital\u2019s Journey To Build Business Resiliency Through Cloud And ERP Transformation Amazon Climate Pledge: Two Years In And Going Strong Microsoft Takes First Steps To Finally Kill The Password For now, there are two initial offerings in the Google Distributed Cloud portfolio\u2014Google Distributed Cloud Edge, now in preview, promises to take Google\u2019s infrastructure and services to where data is generated and analyzed. The offering enables G Core and radio access network (RAN) functions, which Google says will benefit Google AI edge inferencing, computer vision and other mission-critical applications. Google Distributed Cloud Hosted, meanwhile, targets public sector customers and commercial enterprises with stringent security, privacy and residency needs for modernizing their on-premises deployments. Leveraging a local control plane powered by Anthos, this solution enables customers to securely manage their infrastructure, services, APIs, and tooling without ever connecting to the Google Cloud. You read that right\u2014Google Distributed Cloud Hosted does not require connectivity (shots fired, Outposts). This offering will preview in the first half of next year. Google Cloud Platform Google We also learned at the event that Google has extended its global cloud infrastructure into four new regions: Warsaw, Delhi, Melbourne and Toronto. With these additions, Google Cloud now operates in 28 regions worldwide\u2014making it, according to Google, \u201cthe largest and lowest latency network among hyperscale cloud providers.\u201d Google also announced future availability in another handful of new regions: Berlin-Brandenburg, Columbus, OH, Israel, Madrid, Milan, Paris, Santiago, Saudi Arabia and Turin. These extensions are all about data sovereignty, performance, and reliability. Timely security offerings for the enterprise Cybersecurity was also a hot topic at the event, as it has been in the industry at large lately. As the enterprise landscape becomes increasingly hybridized, bad actors have rushed to take advantage of new, emerging opportunities to exploit. The pandemic only accelerated these changes, forcing many businesses to adapt quickly to support a remote workforce. Against that backdrop, Google lifted the curtain on its new Google Cybersecurity Action Team\u2014a task force of Google cybersecurity experts dedicated to supporting the digitization of governments, critical infrastructure and businesses of all sizes. This support will come via strategic advisory services, trust and compliance services, security customer and solutions engineering, threat intelligence, and incident response services. The new team also revealed a framework designed to guide organizations through implementing a \u201ccomprehensive security management program\u201d that leverages Google and its partners\u2019 cloud security technologies. Google says this roadmap complies with the standards outlined in the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s Cybersecurity Framework. The Google Cybersecurity Action Team is part of a massive $10 billion commitment Google announced in August to bolster cybersecurity. Google has also committed to expanding zero trust programs, securing software supply chain frameworks, improving open-source security and generally improving the American workforce\u2019s digital security hygiene. All in all, while I\u2019m not a huge fan of the name, I think Google\u2019s Cybersecurity Action Team is exactly what enterprises are looking for. Furthermore, I think Google is an excellent company to bring it. Google also announced Work Safer, another well-timed security offering that is essentially a security package for hybrid work (Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced this one at the event, so you know it must be special). Work Safer\u2019s zero-trust, browser-based security approach negates the need for local devices, apps, security add-ons and email attachments. It employs built-in controls, encryption and verification to support workers wherever they are, on both company-provided or BYOD endpoints\u2014no VPN, patching or strong account takeover protections necessary. The all-in-one package includes Google Workspace and an array of security solutions across Google\u2019s portfolio. These include BeyondCorp Enterprise, which provides secure access with integrated threat and data protection, reCAPTCHA Enterprise for website fraud protection, Chrome Enterprise for desktop management, Chronicle for security analytics, Titan Security Keys and mobile security and controls for its Pixel and Android devices. Google\u2019s cybersecurity partners, CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks provide additional layers of protection from cybercrime. Google is good at security and these are smart and timely service adders. AI news In the realm of AI, Google revealed Contact Center AI Insights, a new offering in its CCAI product suite. By providing customers with a more granular look at their contact center interaction data, Google says CCAI Insights will help them make data-driven business decisions that drive better organizational efficiency. For example, CCAI Insights uses AI to illuminate and identify the topics customers most frequently need contact center support on, allowing analysts to quickly identify problem areas within their organizations that could benefit from further investment. Additionally, CCAI Insights provides AI-driven, automatic highlighting of essential parts of conversations, such as complaints, requests for a supervisor or instances when a contact center agent attempts to put a customer on hold. Additionally, CCAI Insights leverages Cloud NLP integration to ascertain customer and agent sentiment in support conversations, identify common keywords using entity extraction and then assign entity sentiment to those common keywords. CCAI Insights also leverages NLP technologies to provide analysts with automated topic modeling. Based on user-created unsupervised models of conversational data, CCAI Insights can automatically build a taxonomy of conversation drivers. Customer wins Of course, no tech show would be complete without sharing some recent customer wins and testimonials. Google showcased several new global customers who are utilizing Google Cloud to transform their businesses. We learned that General Mills has selected Google as its preferred cloud partner to unleash the power of data, analytics and AI across the company. Wendy\u2019s, for its part, has turned to Google Cloud\u2019s analytics, AI, and other cloud tools to innovate on the classic drive-thru model. The goal is to provide a more frictionless experience for customers, allowing them to order using their mobile devices and other touchpoint mediums. Google also announced a new multi-year partnership with Siemens Energy, in which Google will help the energy giant migrate its global datacenter network and SAP systems into the cloud. Lastly, DPDHL (Deutsche Post DHL Group) and Google shared they\u2019ve been partnering to develop scalable cloud services to transform DPDHL Group\u2019s burgeoning logistics business. For years, Google rolled out a litany of all-in \u201cborn in the cloud\u201d companies or large companies that appreciated Google\u2019s data and AI capabilities. These new customers were not born in the cloud and had engagements beyond data and AI. This is a good sign for Google as it needs more of these type of engagements for growth. Wrapping up I believe what we see now is the latest salvo in the battle for multi-cloud, which will likely dominate the tech landscape as we know it for the next ten years. And from what I saw at Google Cloud Next \u201921, I believe the company truly \u201cbrought it.\u201d Whether we\u2019re looking at Google Distributed Cloud, the company\u2019s new hybrid cybersecurity offerings or the continued expansion of Google Cloud\u2019s AI-powered toolkit, Google is making a solid argument on all fronts for its role in the modern, multi-cloud enterprise. You don\u2019t have to look any further than the recent customer wins to see how Google Cloud\u2019s overall value prop is improving. Stay tuned and watch for Amazon and Microsoft\u2019s response\u2014it\u2019s going to get interesting. Note: Moor Insights & Strategy writers and editors may have contributed to this article.

    "full_description": "Former Facebook data scientist turned whistleblower Frances Haugen plans to answer questions Monday from lawmakers in the United Kingdom who are working on legislation to rein in the power of social media companies. Haugen is set to appear before a parliamentary committee scrutinizing the British government\u2019s draft legislation to crack down on harmful online content, and her comments could help lawmakers beef up the new rules. She\u2019s testifying the same day that Facebook is set to release its latest earnings and that The Associated Press and other news organizations started publishing stories based on thousands of pages of internal company documents she obtained. It will be her second appearance before lawmakers after she testified in the U.S. Senate earlier this month about the danger she says the company poses, from harming children to inciting political violence and fueling misinformation. Haugen cited internal research documents she secretly copied before leaving her job in Facebook\u2019s civic integrity unit. Story continues below advertisement Read more: Facebook failed to stop global spread of abusive content, documents reveal The documents, which Haugen provided to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, allege Facebook prioritized profits over safety and hid its own research from investors and the public. Some stories based on the files have already been published, exposing internal turmoil after Facebook was blindsided by the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot and how it dithered over curbing divisive content in India, and more is to come. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has disputed Haugen\u2019s portrayal of the company as one that puts profit over the well-being of its users or that pushes divisive content, saying a false picture is being painted. But he does agree on the need for updated internet regulations, saying lawmakers are best able to assess the tradeoffs. Haugen told U.S. lawmakers that she thinks a federal regulator is needed to oversee digital giants like Facebook, something that officials in Britain and the European Union are already working on. The U.K. government\u2019s online safety bill calls for setting up a regulator that would hold companies to account when it comes to removing harmful or illegal content from their platforms, such as terrorist material or child sex abuse images. 1:54 Status update: Facebook reportedly ready to rebrand, build a metaverse Status update: Facebook reportedly ready to rebrand, build a metaverse \u201cThis is quite a big moment,\u201d Damian Collins, the lawmaker who chairs the committee, said ahead of the hearing. \u201cThis is a moment, sort of like Cambridge Analytica, but possibly bigger in that I think it provides a real window into the soul of these companies.\u201d Story continues below advertisement Collins was referring to the 2018 debacle involving data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica, which gathered details on as many as 87 million Facebook users without their permission. Representatives from Facebook and other social media companies plan to speak to the committee Thursday. Ahead of the hearing, Haugen met the father of Molly Russell, a 14-year-old girl who killed herself in 2017 after viewing disturbing content on Facebook-owned Instagram. In a chat filmed by the BBC, Ian Russell told Haugen that after Molly\u2019s death, her family found notes she wrote about being addicted to Instagram. Read more: Explainer: What are the Facebook Papers? Haugen also is scheduled to meet next month with European Union officials in Brussels, where the bloc\u2019s executive commission is updating its digital rulebook to better protect internet users by holding online companies more responsible for illegal or dangerous content. Under the U.K. rules, expected to take effect next year, Silicon Valley giants face an ultimate penalty of up to 10% of their global revenue for any violations. The EU is proposing a similar penalty. The U.K. committee will be hoping to hear more from Haugen about the data that tech companies have gathered. Collins said the internal files that Haugen has turned over to U.S. authorities are important because it shows the kind of information that Facebook holds _ and what regulators should be asking when they investigate these companies. Story continues below advertisement The committee has already heard from another Facebook whistleblower, Sophie Zhang, who raised the alarm after finding evidence of online political manipulation in countries such as Honduras and Azerbaijan before she was fired. 2:04 Whistleblower: Facebook harms children, weakens democracy Whistleblower: Facebook harms children, weakens democracy \u2013 Oct 5, 2021 \u00a9 2021 The Canadian Press",

    "full_description": "Facebook groups are \"dangerous\" and use algorithms that \"take people who have mainstream interests and push them to extreme interests\", a whistleblower has told MPs. Frances Haugen said the groups can become \"echo chambers\" reinforcing and radicalising people's opinions. For example, users with left wing opinions can be pushed to the radical left, while those looking for healthy recipes can be pushed to anorexia content. Facebook whistleblower explains why Instagram is 'more dangerous' than other platforms - follow her testimony live Ms Haugen, a former employee in the company's civic integrity unit, has been giving evidence to MPs considering the draft online safety bill. Among her evidence, she also told the committee that Facebook sees safety as a \"cost centre\" and that it \"unquestionably\" makes online hate worse. She said \"engagement-based metrics\" - such as how many people like, share or comment on a post - were a problem on all sites. Facebook whistleblower live: Frances Haugen explains why Instagram is 'more dangerous' than other social media Facebook under fresh pressure as whistleblower prepares to give evidence to MPs Facebook fined \u00a350m for 'refusing to comply' with regulator She said they favoured polarised content and were \"biased towards bad actors\". Ms Haugen previously appeared before the US Senate and her testimony in the UK comes as fresh stories appeared based on the thousands of documents she leaked. She has already levelled a series allegations, saying Facebook's platforms \"harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy\", and that it refused to act because executives put profits above safety. Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has rejected her claims, saying her attacks were \"misrepresenting\" the work it does and that it \"cares deeply about issues like safety, well-being and mental health\". Ms Haugen told MPs that for any social media platform over a couple of million users, the public should have the right to understand how it might be affecting society. \"Any tech company that has a large societal impact we need to be thinking about how do we get data out of that company...\" she said. Instagram is the most harmful social media service for teenagers, the former Facebook employee added, because it is about \"social comparison\" and \"bodies\". For example, there have been persistent claims that it can make eating disorders worse for some people. The photo-sharing site recently said it was pausing efforts to make a bespoke version for children, and Ms Haugen told MPs she was \"deeply worried\" that it's not possible to make Instagram safe for young teenagers.",

    "content": "Berlin-based low-code data platform Y42 today announced that it has raised a $31 million Series A funding round co-led by Atomico and Insight Partners. La Famiglia, which led the company\u2019s seed round, and Data Community Fund also participated in this round, which brings the company\u2019s total funding to date to just under $34 million. Y42 wants to provide its users with an end-to-end data platform that can replace the various tools they are using today to integrate, transform, orchestrate and visualize their data. And yes, that means it wants to be able to give its users a single tool that can, for the most part, replace existing services like Fivetran, Airbyte, dbt and Tableau. Image Credits: Y42 \u201cIt is a very crowded market,\u201d Y42 under and CEO Hung Dang said. \u201cBut this is why the way we\u2019re trying to approach this is by having a very different hypothesis than most point-to-point tools out there. [\u2026] I come into this game with the mindset that I don\u2019t care how long it takes me to build this product, but if I have a clean slate, how would I build this product? We are taking all the best practices of the modern data stack of these point-to-point tools, but apply them to one consistent platform.\u201d This means Y42 wants to give business intelligence teams and data analysts a single tool that helps them bridge the gap between doing some basic data analysis and hiring multiple full-time data engineers who can maintain a modern data stack. That\u2019s an area where the company is winning a lot of new customers, but it also means that Y42 has to be able to scale with those users as they build up their data practices, something Dang is optimistic the company can do (especially given some of the features it has on its roadmap for next year). Image Credits: Y42 \u201cEvery business leader today knows they need to extract more value from their data, but the data talent to adopt and maintain a modern stack is scarce; demand for data engineers is growing 50% annually. Y42 unlocks this bottleneck and democratizes access to data tools beyond a select few. In that, they are creating a new category.\u201d said Atomico partner Irina Haivas. Dang also noted that a number of bigger players in the industry, including the likes of Snowflake, are very interested in partnering with Y42. That\u2019s in part because the service functions a bit like a gatekeeper for new customers who may not even yet have a data warehouse in use. Since Y42 itself sits on top of Google Cloud, BigQuery was always a natural recommendation for these customers, but it\u2019s obviously not the only one.

    "full_description": "Berlin-based low-code data platform Y42 today announced that it has raised a $31 million Series A funding round co-led by Atomico and Insight Partners. La Famiglia, which led the company\u2019s seed round , and Data Community Fund also participated in this round, which brings the company\u2019s total funding to date to just under $34 million. Y42 wants to provide its users with an end-to-end data platform that can replace the various tools they are using today to integrate, transform, orchestrate and visualize their data. And yes, that means it wants to be able to give its users a single tool that can, for the most part, replace existing services like Fivetran, Airbyte, dbt and Tableau. Image Credits: Y42 \u201cIt is a very crowded market,\u201d Y42 under and CEO Hung Dang said. \u201cBut this is why the way we\u2019re trying to approach this is by having a very different hypothesis than most point-to-point tools out there. [\u2026] I come into this game with the mindset that I don\u2019t care how long it takes me to build this product, but if I have a clean slate, how would I build this product? We are taking all the best practices of the modern data stack of these point-to-point tools, but apply them to one consistent platform.\u201d This means Y42 wants to give business intelligence teams and data analysts a single tool that helps them bridge the gap between doing some basic data analysis and hiring multiple full-time data engineers who can maintain a modern data stack. That\u2019s an area where the company is winning a lot of new customers, but it also means that Y42 has to be able to scale with those users as they build up their data practices, something Dang is optimistic the company can do (especially given some of the features it has on its roadmap for next year). Image Credits: Y42 \u201cEvery business leader today knows they need to extract more value from their data, but the data talent to adopt and maintain a modern stack is scarce; demand for data engineers is growing 50% annually. Y42 unlocks this bottleneck and democratizes access to data tools beyond a select few. In that, they are creating a new category.\u201d said Atomico partner Irina Haivas. Dang also noted that a number of bigger players in the industry, including the likes of Snowflake, are very interested in partnering with Y42. That\u2019s in part because the service functions a bit like a gatekeeper for new customers who may not even yet have a data warehouse in use. Since Y42 itself sits on top of Google Cloud, BigQuery was always a natural recommendation for these customers, but it\u2019s obviously not the only one. The company currently has about 70 employees, up from 25 in March. Its customers include the likes of LifeMD , Petlab and Everdrop . Unsurprisingly, Y42 plans to use the new funding to accelerate the development of its platform, scale its team and expand its go-to-market efforts.

    "full_description": "The Samsung Galaxy S22 range is likely to be one of the next big smartphone launches, as while we don\u2019t expect these phones until 2022, they could land in January, and there\u2019s not much more expected in 2021. As such, there have already been lots of leaks about these handsets, and many of those leaks are focused on the S Pen stylus \u2013 a feature which is likely to be supported by at least one model, given that the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra supports it. With there not being a Samsung Galaxy Note 21 , the Samsung Galaxy S22 range could therefore also be the closest thing to a new Note model that we see for a while, especially if Samsung carries out some rumored changes to the range. Below we\u2019ll run you through all the S Pen leaks and rumors so far, to paint a picture of which models are likely to include stylus support, and how big a feature it could be for Samsung\u2019s next flagships. There\u2019s a whole lot of evidence that the S Pen will be a feature of the Samsung Galaxy S22 range, but so far this evidence points to it once again only being the Ultra model that will get it. We first heard that the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra might support the S Pen back in July 2021 . This came from a wide-ranging leak, and only the Ultra model was mentioned as getting this support. The leak didn\u2019t provide any additional details about it though, such as whether the stylus would come as standard with the phone, and whether there would be a slot for it, neither of which were the case with the S21 Ultra, despite these being features of the Note range. More recently though, prolific leaker Ice Universe claimed that the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra would have an S Pen slot , and that it would also have a similar design to the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra . They didn\u2019t share any imagery, but we didn\u2019t have to wait long for that, with another leaker (@OnLeaks via Digit.in) sharing unofficial renders of the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra just a couple of days later. You can see one of these above, and it shows an S Pen slot in the bottom left corner (when viewing the phone from the front). These renders also show the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra as having a squarer design than its predecessor, giving it a Note-like look as suggested by Ice Universe. The same source then came back with renders supposedly showing the Samsung Galaxy S22 and Galaxy S22 Plus , and these had a more S21-like design, with no S Pen slot. Next up, we\u2019ve seen case renders for cases seemingly designed for the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, and these include a cut-out that\u2019s likely for the S Pen slot, backing up the renders above. You can see one of these below. And most recently of all, a leaker shared images and videos of what\u2019s apparently a dummy unit of the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra . Dummy units are sometimes used by accessory makers to help them design products prior to a phone\u2019s launch, and this one is light on details \u2013 with no S Pen slot or any other ports, but the source of the leak claimed that the finished phone will have an S Pen slot. Beyond the leaks suggesting that S Pen support is planned for the Galaxy S22 range, there are also good reasons Samsung would include it. As noted above, there wasn\u2019t a Samsung Galaxy Note 21, so fans of that range will have been left clamoring for a suitable handset. The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra could potentially fill that role \u2013 especially if as has been rumored it has an S Pen slot and a Note-like design.

Given that multiple sources have suggested this and that there aren\u2019t any dissenting voices, we think that\u2019s likely, especially given the lack of a new Note model.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Alexey is the Founder and CEO of DevTeam.Space , a remote software development platform. Getty The past few decades have seen the majority of the world's leading software companies \u2014 including Airbnb, Uber, Facebook and Google \u2014 building their products in Silicon Valley. As a result, Silicon Valley has built itself up as the global tech center. Today, it employs hundreds of thousands of high-tech workers and is home to 10 of California's 14 Fortune 500 companies, according to the Silicon Valley Business Journal. The Business Journal notes that the Fortune 500 businesses in the San Francisco and San Jose areas generated $1.37 trillion in revenue in 2020. Built predominantly by in-house teams who live and work in the Valley, applications ranging from Apple's Siri to the AI systems that are powering Netflix's movie recommendation system and autonomous vehicle technology have truly revolutionized our world. However, a new revolution has already started that is set to change the way companies build and grow. I lived in Silicon Valley for seven years, and this trend is developing right in front of our eyes. The seeds of this change have, perversely, been sown by the Valley itself. Much like the zealous Dr. Frankenstein creating his lifeform, Silicon Valley tech companies began creating the source of the Valley's undoing around a decade ago. The shadow now overcoming Silicon Valley takes the form of cloud computing coupled with sophisticated business communication tools, remote management tools and online education platforms to master any skills needed to build world-class software. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event Just a decade ago, most companies developing software solutions had to invest heavily in IT infrastructure and in offices near a skilled workforce to tap into the best possible talent pool. However, the last decade has seen cloud providers like AWS create the systems to give even individual developers access to the kind of infrastructure that was only available to companies the size of Microsoft 10 years ago. These platforms also offer powerful new software development tools that dramatically cut down development times via the use of readily available APIs, etc. Also, communication tools that were once customer-oriented have now become business-orientated, meaning that businesses located in the furthest corners of the globe can increasingly gain access to business messaging apps such as Slack, conference rooms such as those provided by Zoom or Microsoft Teams, and worker performance monitoring applications such as Monday. These tools allow developers, designers, managers and product owners to work as an effective team despite the fact they have never physically even met one another. Silicon Valley was also the driving force behind the creation of the online learning platforms that have empowered people from all over the world to be able to gain the skills and access to the funding that allows them to become remote software developers and the next generation of startup founders. One of the foremost examples of companies that helped to bake this new layer of innovation is Y Combinator. It now offers a free startup acceleration course that teaches entrepreneurs how to begin and manage their own startups. Added to this, it also provides access to funding to make it happen. To date, Y Combinator has invested in over 2,000 companies, including as Airbnb, Stripe, Dropbox and Reddit. The combination of these forces means that Silicon Valley's \"cat\" is out of the box and there is no way back. New Internet Unicorns Will Be Built Remotely There is another part of Silicon Valley's success that is also eating away at it. A mix of skyrocketing property prices and salaries had already begun to cause an exodus from Silicon Valley of both companies and workers even before the Covid-19 pandemic hit. The pandemic caught most companies off guard and has served as a catalyst in accelerating a change in work practices and business environments that was already well underway. Zapier is one example of a company already operating the business model of tomorrow. It relies entirely on remote office work rather than any headquarters or office. Its model meant that it experienced little to no disruption when the Covid-19 pandemic forced countries and states into lockdown. It's now valued at $5 billion and continues to grow in 2021. As a result of the pandemic, numerous other companies scrambled to follow suit and initiate policies that asked their workers to work remotely. For example, Dropbox and Coinbase announced that they would become remote-first companies. Following big tech, more and more Silicon Valley startups have taken notice of this trend, realizing they don't need to actually even be located in Silicon Valley with its high real estate prices, salaries and infrastructure strains. Instead, many have already begun opting for the remote work approach in order to streamline costs while reaping the benefits of access to the global talent pool. PwC, Gallup and the NCBI have provided some extremely useful and eye-opening insights into integrating a remote work approach into businesses. Conclusion The bottom line is that we can expect this trend to continue tearing down the status quo of Silicon Valley in the coming decade. In regard to the software development industry, the future \"unicorns\" should be built entirely by remote teams that are managed by remote workers. It may sound like an \"extravaganza\" now, but let's reevaluate this in 10 years. The sooner you follow this trend, the higher the chances should be for your business to thrive in the future. It's a bittersweet taste for Silicon Valley. From one perspective, it fulfilled the dream to spread innovation and technology across the globe. Yet Silicon Valley itself looks to be fading in the process. Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify?",

    "full_description": "I've been bullish about how good Halo Infinite feels to play in technical tests. Hell, I even likened it to Titanfall 3 after spending a weekend grappling around its brilliant big team battles . But the absence of any campaign footage since 2019 has been troubling \u2014an absence that 343 Industries thankfully remedied with a fresh new gameplay trailer this afternoon. Where our first glimpse of Halo Infinite's campaign gave us a straight run through a single mission, today's overview provided a, well, overview of how this open-ended Halo will play out. To that end we do, in fact, see plenty of open-world trappings, with Chief approaching Banished (a new, hot Covenant that comes with a bright red makeover) bases and blowing them the hell up with rocket launches, grenades and thrown explosive barrels. As someone who's adored their time with the multiplayer fights, it's exciting to see that same sandbox applied to traditional Halo baddies like Jackals and Hunters. But there are some less traditional Halo elements, including bosses with full-on health bars, and vehicle stations that let you literally pluck Wasps and Warthogs from the sky. A peek at the world map also shows us collectables and side missions (like the aforementioned outpost assault), while there are also upgrade trees to add more charges to equipment like grappling hooks and repulsors. It also appears you'll have a \"Spartan-killing\" Elite stalking you throughout the campaign\u2014and for as much as Infinite wants to move beyond 343's previous games, the studio couldn't resist bringing back some ancient Forerunner-adjacent aliens. It's that last part, plus the game's narrative centring on a new, terribly na\u00efve AI named \"The Weapon\" (effectively a younger, less confident Cortana) that has me a little concerned about the direction Infinite's campaign may be taking. But while it's very easy to make Far Cry Halo comparisons with this more open format, it does still look like there's plenty of space to muck around and pull of daft stunts with Infinite's ridiculous toolset. It's just a shame you won't be able to roll through Zeta Halo with a friend when Halo Infinite launches on December 8.",

    "full_description": "Brain cancer is difficult to contain and is often resistant to conventional treatment methods. Predicting tumor cell behavior requires a better understanding of their invasion mechanism. Now, researchers from University of Fukui, Japan, have used high-density nanofibers that mimic the microenvironment of the brain to capture these tumor cells, opening doors to novel therapeutic solutions for aggressive brain cancer. Our body heals its injuries by essentially replacing damaged cells with new cells. The new cells often migrate to the site of injury, a process known as cell migration . However, abnormal cell migration can also facilitate the transport and spread of cancer cells within the body. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one such example of a highly invasive brain tumor that spreads via migration of the tumor cells . The frequency at which such tumor cells spread and grow make conventional tumor removal methods ineffective. Furthermore, options such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy are harmful to healthy cells and cause adverse effects. In order to develop improved therapeutic strategies, a precise understanding of the invasion mechanism of GBM cells is necessary. An alternative treatment strategy in consideration involves capturing the migrating tumor cells. It turns out that cell migration is dictated by the structure and the orientation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) \u2013 fibrous structures surrounding the cells. By engineering similar structures of desired geometries, it is, therefore, possible to exert control over the migration process. Now, in a study published in ACS Applied Bio Materials , researchers from University of Fukui, Japan, have designed a platform based on nanofibers that resemble the ECM to examine their effect on GBM cells. \"We fabricated a nanofibrous sheet in which the fiber density changes from end to end gradually using a technique called 'electrospinning' and carried out a culture experiment of brain tumor cells,\" says Dr. Satoshi Fujita, who headed the study. The researchers observed clear distinctions in cell movement in nanofibers of different densities. They found that the denser fibers promoted the formation of focal adhesions clusters in the cells that resulted in a slower cell migration. Taking advantage of this negative correlation between cell movement and fiber density, the researchers were able to control and direct the migration of cells by designing a nanofibrous sheet with stepwise varying densities. By arranging the fibers in a high-to-low density configuration, they were able to restrict the movement of cells as most of them were captured in the high-density zones. On the other hand, a low-to-high density configuration had the opposite effect and encouraged migration. In addition, they noticed that the gaps between the zones hindered cell migration , leading to cells being trapped in the high-density zones. This one-way migration was observed for the first time and the researchers named it cell trapping, after fish and insect traps that cause their prey to travel along a single direction before trapping it. \"The study demonstrates the feasibility of capturing migrating cells using electrospun nanofibers that mimic the microenvironment of the brain,\" comments Dr. Fujita. The team is excited about the future prospects of their nanofiber-based platform. \"It is available for the design of scaffolding materials, which are the basis of regenerative medicine, in combination with various fiber processing technologies and material surface treatment technologies. This could lead to the development of practical applications of regenerative medicines,\" says Dr. Fujita, \"In addition, it can be used as a processing technology for culture carriers for efficient production of biological drugs including proteins, antibodies, and vaccines.\" Explore further",

    "full_description": "The suspected Russian hackers behind last year\u2019s SolarWinds breach have re-emerged to target dozens of companies across the global IT supply chain, according to Microsoft The hacking group, dubbed Nobelium or Cozy Bear, is trying to attack resellers and technology providers that help customers manage and deploy their cloud services, Microsoft said in a Monday report . The goal: To hijack access and then target their \u201cdownstream customers,\u201d including government offices and think tanks. The strategy echoes last year\u2019s attack on SolarWinds, a Texas-based IT company that serves numerous customers, including US government agencies. By breaking into the company, the suspected Russian hackers were able to spread malicious software via SolarWinds software to at least nine federal agencies and over 100 private firms, including Microsoft itself. The latest hacking campaign, which Microsoft began tracking in May, has already succeeded in compromising some customers. \u201cSince May, we have notified more than 140 resellers and technology service providers that have been targeted by Nobelium. We continue to investigate, but to date we believe as many as 14 of these resellers and service providers have been compromised,\u201d the company says. Microsoft did not explain the severity of the breaches, but the private firms targeted include those based in the US and Europe. Microsoft points the finger at the Kremlin for orchestrating the hacks. \u201cThis recent activity is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling \u2014now or in the future\u2014 targets of interest to the Russian government,\u201d Microsoft claims. In April, the White House formally blamed a Russian intelligence agency, the SVR, for instigating the SolarWinds breach. (The SVR was also allegedly behind the 2016 hack on the Democratic National Committee.) To compromise victim companies, the hackers have relied on password guessing and spear phishing emails to gain access. \u201cThese attacks have highlighted the need for (IT) administrators to adopt strict account security practices and take additional measures to secure their environments,\u201d according to Microsoft, which released an advisory with tips on how companies can fend off the threat. \"These attacks have been a part of a larger wave of Nobelium activities this summer,\" Microsoft adds. \"In fact, between July 1 and October 19 this year, we informed 609 customers that they had been attacked 22,868 times by Nobelium, with a success rate in the low single digits.\"",

    "full_description": "Virulent diseases which devastate food crops like coffee, almond, citrus and grapevines with serious global economic and environmental consequences, could be controlled by large-scale aerial scanning, says new collaborative research involving Swansea University. Each year, plant pathogens causing disease result in an estimated 16% production loss globally\u2014a level that has not significantly reduced over the last 40 years despite increased pesticide use. However, the Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) pathogen is arguably the greatest threat to crops, causing dieback, browning and loss of leaves, reduced fruit size and death and is a threat to at least 550 species worldwide. The Xf pathogen seriously disrupts agriculture production\u2014in the olive sector alone it has led to losses of up \u20ac5.2 billion per year. Outside America and Europe, the spread of this pathogen in Asia and Israel has intensified international calls to contain this global Xf epidemic. Swansea University researchers from Department of Geography were part of an international team of experts from the University of Salford, the University of Melbourne (UoM), the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), and the European Commission that scanned one million infected and healthy trees in seven regions across Europe. Using advanced imaging technology, known as hyperspectral imagery, and thermal imaging they found it could detect infectious plant diseases caused by the Xf pathogen before symptoms became visible. The research published in Nature Communications led by Professor Pablo Zarco-Tejada (UoM and CSIC), reveals that new aerial large-scale plant crop scanning methods can achieve up to 92% accuracy in detecting Xf and could be key to successfully to containing or even eradicating it. The Swansea University team mainly focussed on the development and setting up of the radiative transfer models used to collect the plant traits retrieval, and also participated in the field work and airborne data collection. Swansea University researcher Alberto Hornero said: \"This new research is a step forward in large scale hyperspectral screening for Xf detection. We can now pinpoint with great accuracy the crops being affected by the Xf pathogen rather than by other environmental causes before any symptoms appear. In the future this could allow for more timely containment and elimination action to be taken to protect crops which can help reduce the impact that Xf has on the environment and economy worldwide.\" Explore further",

In order to make digital experiences possible, software is always in play. Technology organizations are typically faced with the following question: Should we build our own software in-house or buy it? While there are benefits to both, the trend has increasingly been shifting toward buying it. Why? There are several reasons, including developer scarcity (i.e., not having the talent on-hand to build proprietary software), the fact that software built in-house is harder to scale, the fact that cost of maintenance of in-house software is high and its long time-to-value since building your own software takes much more time than buying a pre-built solution. However, as more software is purchased, managing it all becomes a nightmare. What has arisen as software toolchains become vaster and complex are centers of excellence (COE). From a software delivery perspective, COEs are either individuals or teams that are highly experienced in each tech competency, that are champions of best practices innovation and that often lead training and knowledge sharing across the organization. Let\u2019s take a deeper look at COEs and the evolution toward a software-as-a-service (SaaS) center of excellence (SCOE). Current State of COEs COEs are mentioned here in plural for a reason \u2014 multiple are needed within an IT organization. COEs in this context might be focused on a certain technology or process like the cloud, AI or DevOps. Having several COEs enables innovation and differentiation through collaboration. A COE is not just limited to training and knowledge sharing, but it also becomes the glue between operational and leadership teams. One of the more common COEs that has come about in the past five years or so is the cloud center of excellence (CCOE) . Cloud migration is a growing trend as organizations look to reduce costs, achieve higher levels of security and compliance and deploy faster. As adoption continues to rise, organizations have realized the need for a CCOE. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event While the benefits of moving to the cloud have been proven, no one ever said it was easy. As organizations move to the cloud, should they implement a lift and shift strategy or rebuild entirely? Is multi-cloud or hybrid cloud the best option? How does this migration impact multiple departments? There is a lot to consider and manage, and there is a lot of room for creativity when it comes to this initiative. That\u2019s why CCOEs have become more prevalent to help guide teams efficiently and methodically \u2014 they have become the lighthouse for cloud adoption in organizations. CCOEs are the main point of contact for the cloud, and their ability to provide information organization-wide is their biggest asset. This is just one example of a prevalent COE; however, a new COE is starting to emerge, as SaaS applications are entering a new frenzy . The Rise Of The SaaS Center Of Excellence SaaS has been on the rise for years and shows no signs of slowing. Currently, there are more than 10,000 SaaS applications on the market today, and in 2020, almost 75% of organizations reported that nearly all of their apps were SaaS. Additionally, SaaS has been predicted to reach a market size of $265 billion by 2025. Why are so many companies turning to SaaS? SaaS allows for greater flexibility, greater scalability, easier integrations and faster time to value. Just as cloud migrations have needed a COE, now SaaS needs a COE, too. A benefit and a challenge of SaaS is how easy it is to buy. These apps typically start at a low cost point, and they\u2019re often ready to use right after purchase. The challenge is that any employee can \u201cswipe\u201d the company credit card on a SaaS app to help them with their daily work, and this adds up quickly. In companies with thousands of employees, they may be dealing with hundreds or more individual SaaS apps with limited visibility into total costs, security and compliance issues and more. This is where the SCOE is needed. An SCOE can help wrangle the sprawl of SaaS and be the guiding light for SaaS adoption and implementation within the organization. Despite its challenges, SaaS is still beneficial and enables many employees to do their job better; it just needs leadership and management. Further, as COEs for cloud, SaaS and other areas within an organization grow, it\u2019s important that they collaborate and work together. COEs should be communicating regularly, sharing knowledge and learning from each other\u2019s best practices. Just because COEs have their own competencies does not mean they should be working in silos. COEs have proven to be successful across IT organizations as new technologies and processes continue to surface. Now that the golden age of SaaS is here, it\u2019s time for organizations to consider creating an SCOE to manage complexity and growing costs and be the beacon of innovation and best practices for SaaS within the company. In future articles, I will outline the structure of an SCOE, what roles are needed and the responsibilities within that need to be managed.

The rest of the internet hasn\u2019t been so concerned about this, and it has been public knowledge for a week at this point. Apparently, Google saw my embargo tweet for Apple products on Monday and might be moving their Pixel 6 Monday embargo \u2620\ufe0f https://t.co/JZzY3cChCq\u2014 Jon Prosser (@jon_prosser) October 18, 2021 For the most part, it seems reviewers, bloggers and news outlets have played fair with the embargo. I\u2019ve not seen a full-blown review out there before now and I\u2019ve not seen a bunch of camera samples. With the way Google\u2019s hardware leaks, that is a small accomplishment. However, with the embargo lifting today, the reviews are most definitely coming. Again, we\u2019re not an Android-focused website or YouTube channel, so our experience is likely different than others, but it needs to be noted that we only received our review units of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro the morning of Google\u2019s announcement. That means we\u2019ve only possessed both phones for 6 days at this point. Now, remember that reviews take time to write, edit, and publish. Videos take even longer. If other reviewers got their phones around the same time as we did, you need to consider this for just a moment. To meet the embargo time, a review video was likely shot at the end of last week so edits could be made and the video could be properly produced. Again, if review units went out around the same time for everyone, that means there are some of those reviews being made after only a few days actually using two phones. This is not the recipe for an accurate, thoughtful, well-considered review. First impressions? Sure. Reaction videos? Absolutely. Full-blown, make-a-purchase-decision reviews? Not in that time frame. There are simply too many things to consider with these phones to make that sort of decision in a few days time. Hell, I\u2019m still struggling to decide which phone I want to purchase right now. Do I stay on the affordable side with the Pixel 6 or splurge on the giant Pixel 6 Pro? I\u2019m honestly still on the fence and haven\u2019t even pulled the trigger on a purchase because I\u2019m so conflicted with just that part of the equation. And that\u2019s why I warn you to take all these reviews that will arrive today with a grain of salt. There are likely YouTube channels that will have had a longer look at these phones than we have, and if that\u2019s the case I can confidently say that you can trust those opinions for the Pixel 6 just as you would with any new device. This one just hits different But consider for just a moment the difference in this review process versus the more-standard iPhone or Galaxy S upgrade. Those who review phones like the iPhone or Galaxy S devices know what they\u2019re getting into with each iteration. Small tweaks in the hardware, small tweaks to the cameras, small tweaks to the software. Samsung and Apple aren\u2019t making sweeping changes to their phones each year because they\u2019ve both carved out a solid niche of users and they just don\u2019t need to do that anymore. Additionally, as a large tech company, if you\u2019ve found a working formula, you don\u2019t want to alienate your user base by huge updates to fix things that aren\u2019t broken. The Pixel story hasn\u2019t exactly been that way for Google. The more-affordable iterations (like Pixel 3a and 4a) have done well, the photo chops have always impressed, and the hardware has always had a few hiccups that needed to be fixed in the next version. Pixels, as a whole, needed a refresh and a new start. Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are absolutely that new beginning, and from my few days using them, I can confirm that these are the best Pixels I\u2019ve used. Ever. But they are different from Pixels of the past, and that means I need time to really get into those differences to form a level opinion of these phones. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone, here. We are holding off on our review because \u2013 to be honest \u2013 we\u2019re just not ready to make one yet. These phones aren\u2019t a small iteration to the Pixel formula. They are a rethink of the entire setup in good ways. But this means that even simple things like phone reception, camera quality, and general performance aren\u2019t just a given. We have an unproven processor in Tensor, an unfamiliar modem, and a completely new Samsung sensors in the camera array. So far so good, but I think these new hardware pieces deserve a bit of time to fully come to grips with in a new Pixel phone. So, our review is coming, but not here yet. Soon? Sure, but only after I can confidently say these phones are the ones we\u2019ve truly been hoping for. I want them to be so badly, but I also don\u2019t want that to cloud my judgement. $599 \u2013 $899 is a lot of money to spend, and we want our guiding opinion to be one based on facts, not hopes. I\u2019m not saying all the reviews you see today will be partially-formed, but many of them will be. There\u2019s simply too much new stuff going on here to break it all down in a week. If you know this going in, you can be a bit more prepared to meet the praises and criticisms that will be leveled at these phones today. And I promise, ours will follow soon.

I\u2019ve not seen a full-blown review out there before now and I\u2019ve not seen a bunch of camera samples. With the way Google\u2019s hardware leaks, that is a small accomplishment. However, with the embargo lifting today, the reviews are most definitely coming. Again, we\u2019re not an Android-focused website or YouTube channel, so our experience is likely different than others, but it needs to be noted that we only received our review units of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro the morning of Google\u2019s announcement. That means we\u2019ve only possessed both phones for 6 days at this point. Now, remember that reviews take time to write, edit, and publish. Videos take even longer. If other reviewers got their phones around the same time as we did, you need to consider this for just a moment. To meet the embargo time, a review video was likely shot at the end of last week so edits could be made and the video could be properly produced. Again, if review units went out around the same time for everyone, that means there are some of those reviews being made after only a few days actually using two phones. This is not the recipe for an accurate, thoughtful, well-considered review. First impressions? Sure. Reaction videos? Absolutely. Full-blown, make-a-purchase-decision reviews? Not in that time frame. There are simply too many things to consider with these phones to make that sort of decision in a few days time. Hell, I\u2019m still struggling to decide which phone I want to purchase right now. Do I stay on the affordable side with the Pixel 6 or splurge on the giant Pixel 6 Pro? I\u2019m honestly still on the fence and haven\u2019t even pulled the trigger on a purchase because I\u2019m so conflicted with just that part of the equation. And that\u2019s why I warn you to take all these reviews that will arrive today with a grain of salt. There are likely YouTube channels that will have had a longer look at these phones than we have, and if that\u2019s the case I can confidently say that you can trust those opinions for the Pixel 6 just as you would with any new device. This one just hits different But consider for just a moment the difference in this review process versus the more-standard iPhone or Galaxy S upgrade. Those who review phones like the iPhone or Galaxy S devices know what they\u2019re getting into with each iteration. Small tweaks in the hardware, small tweaks to the cameras, small tweaks to the software. Samsung and Apple aren\u2019t making sweeping changes to their phones each year because they\u2019ve both carved out a solid niche of users and they just don\u2019t need to do that anymore. Additionally, as a large tech company, if you\u2019ve found a working formula, you don\u2019t want to alienate your user base by huge updates to fix things that aren\u2019t broken. The Pixel story hasn\u2019t exactly been that way for Google. The more-affordable iterations (like Pixel 3a and 4a) have done well, the photo chops have always impressed, and the hardware has always had a few hiccups that needed to be fixed in the next version. Pixels, as a whole, needed a refresh and a new start. Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are absolutely that new beginning, and from my few days using them, I can confirm that these are the best Pixels I\u2019ve used. Ever. But they are different from Pixels of the past, and that means I need time to really get into those differences to form a level opinion of these phones. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone, here. We are holding off on our review because \u2013 to be honest \u2013 we\u2019re just not ready to make one yet. These phones aren\u2019t a small iteration to the Pixel formula. They are a rethink of the entire setup in good ways. But this means that even simple things like phone reception, camera quality, and general performance aren\u2019t just a given. We have an unproven processor in Tensor, an unfamiliar modem, and a completely new Samsung sensors in the camera array. So far so good, but I think these new hardware pieces deserve a bit of time to fully come to grips with in a new Pixel phone. So, our review is coming, but not here yet. Soon? Sure, but only after I can confidently say these phones are the ones we\u2019ve truly been hoping for. I want them to be so badly, but I also don\u2019t want that to cloud my judgement. $599 \u2013 $899 is a lot of money to spend, and we want our guiding opinion to be one based on facts, not hopes. I\u2019m not saying all the reviews you see today will be partially-formed, but many of them will be. There\u2019s simply too much new stuff going on here to break it all down in a week. If you know this going in, you can be a bit more prepared to meet the praises and criticisms that will be leveled at these phones today. And I promise, ours will follow soon.

Saul Loeb | Getty Images reader comments 20 with 19 posters participating Share this story Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Facebook\u2019s senior executives interfered to allow US politicians and celebrities to post whatever they wanted on its social network despite pleas from employees to stop, leaked internal documents suggest. Employees claim in the documents that while Facebook has long insisted that it is politically neutral, it allowed rightwing figures to break rules designed to curb misinformation and harmful content, after being stung by accusations of bias from conservatives. In September 2020, just ahead of the US presidential election, the author of an internal memo wrote that \u201cdirector-level employees\u201d had \u201cwritten internally that they would prefer to formally exclude political considerations from the decision-making process.\u201d The author called for the company\u2019s leadership to create a \u201cfirewall\u201d around its content moderation teams to stop this from happening and to make sure Facebook did not keep up or take down posts because of external political and media pressure. In another internal note, dated December 2020, an employee claimed that Facebook\u2019s public policy team blocked decisions to take down posts \u201cwhen they see that they could harm powerful political actors.\u201d \u201cIn multiple cases the final judgment about whether a prominent post violates a certain written policy are made by senior executives, sometimes Mark Zuckerberg,\u201d the author added, referring to Facebook\u2019s chief executive. Parts of the note were previously reported by BuzzFeed. In a further example from 2019, Zuckerberg was alleged to have been personally involved in a decision to allow a video that made the false claim that abortion is \u201cnever medically necessary.\u201d Advertisement The post, which had been taken down by a moderator, was reinstated following complaints by Republican politicians, the document said. The documents, part of a wider cache dubbed the Facebook Papers, were disclosed to US regulators and provided to Congress in redacted form by the legal counsel of whistleblower Frances Haugen. A consortium of news organisations, including the Financial Times, has obtained the redacted versions received by Congress. Facebook declined to respond to queries about the outcome of any discussions about separating its content team from the policy and communications teams. Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesperson, said: \u201cAt the heart of these stories is a premise which is false. Yes, we\u2019re a business and we make profit, but the idea that we do so at the expense of people\u2019s safety or wellbeing misunderstands where our own commercial interests lie. The truth is we\u2019ve invested $13bn and have over 40,000 people to do one job: keep people safe on Facebook.\u201d Staff told to aim for \u2018\u201cunimpeachable neutrality\u201d A former Facebook executive told the FT that Zuckerberg had long told staff to aim for what he called \u201cunimpeachable neutrality.\u201d This was important particularly around US political groups, employees were told, because the company did not want to be accused of breaking campaign rules by giving a donation in kind. But three other former employees said they had observed how Facebook applied its own rules in an inconsistent and haphazard way, with special treatment for celebrities. One former integrity team employee said: \u201cFor the people running Facebook, it seems like they care much more about not appearing biased than actually not being biased. Often their efforts at the former make the latter worse.\u201d",

    "full_description": "Google-owned video sharing app YouTube is riddled with phishing and crypto scams, researchers from the search engine giant's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) have recently discovered. Cyber criminals are using cookie-theft malware to hijack YouTube channels to promote phishing and scams, the researchers said. Google has linked the activities to a group found active on Russian forums. With the malware, hackers can access people's passwords and even YouTube channel credentials. Online games, anti-virus softwares, and photo-editing are some ways using which cyber criminals are approaching YouTube users to scam them, a report by TAG has revealed. Hackers have also been creating fake pages on social networking platforms to direct their victims to and make them click on infected links. Researchers further warned that these cyber criminals have been using breached YouTube channels for live streaming crypto content to scam investors. \u201cA large number of hijacked channels were rebranded for cryptocurrency scam live-streaming. The channel name, profile picture and content were all replaced with cryptocurrency branding to impersonate large tech or cryptocurrency exchange firms. The attacker live-streamed videos promising cryptocurrency giveaways in exchange for an initial contribution,\u201d Ashley Shen from Google's TAG wrote in the report. Deeper analysis into the matter has revealed that hacked YouTube channels were trading within the range of $3 (roughly Rs. 225) to $4,000 (roughly Rs. 3 lakh). In July 2020, famous Indian YouTuber Ajay Nagar, who is known by the name of CarryMinati, had reported that one of his YouTube channels had been compromised and was showing questionable Bitcoin links to his followers. Along with YouTube, crypto-scammers have also been misusing other platforms like WhatsApp and Twitter among others, to unlawfully extract benefits from unsuspecting crypto enthusiasts. Last year, the verified accounts of several well-known people including Barack Obama, Kim Kardashian West and, Elon Musk were hacked by crypto-criminals, who posted infected Bitcoin links to lure their victims into a scam. Amid the expansion of the crypto-culture on a global level, scammers have been trying to find more opportunities to use this development in their favour. Earlier in April, a report had revealed that the total crypto crime in 2020 has amounted to around $10.52 billion (roughly Rs. 79,194 crore). Analyst firm Chainalysis in a recent report had also revealed that at least $815 million (roughly Rs. 6,135 crore) was sent in crypto to scam projects from Eastern European countries between July 2020 and June 2021.",

    "full_description": "Microsoft said the hackers behind the SolarWinds cyberattack are engaged in a fresh campaign to compromise global networks by targeting the tech supply chain, including resellers and providers of cloud technology. Microsoft attributes the coordinated attack, which was first observed in May, to a group called Nobelium, the same state-sponsored Russian hackers who used sophisticated intrusion techniques in 2020 to infect with malware as many as 18,000 customers of Texas-based software company SolarWinds Corp. More than 140 technology service providers and resellers have been notified as recent targets of the hackers and 14 of them are believed to have been compromised, Microsoft said in a blog on Monday. Also read : Looking for a smartphone? Check Mobile Finder here . Nobelium was also behind an attack on IT companies, governments, think tanks and financial service entities earlier this year that spanned 36 countries, Microsoft announced in June. When they met in Geneva in the summer, US President Joe Biden said he gave Russian President Vladimir Putin a list of 16 critical sectors that shouldn\u2019t be hacked to deter a cyber response from the U.S. government, but the attacks have continued. The Kremlin, for its part, has repeatedly denied responsibility for any hacking attacks. This time, between July and October this year, \u201cwe informed 609 customers that they had been attacked 22,868 times by Nobelium, with a success rate in the low single digits,\u201d Microsoft Corporate Vice President of Customer Security and Trust Tom Burt wrote. The Redmond, Washington-based company said this activity was another indicator that \u201cRussia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain, and establish a mechanism for surveilling - now or in the future - targets of interest to the Russian government.\u201d Biden\u2019s Cyber Red Line Is Prime for Putin Challenge, Experts Say The White House, which issued an executive order in May this year urging the private sector to bolster its cyber defences, said it was increasing its intelligence sharing and other measures to protect against cyber threats. The attacks described in the Microsoft blog were unsophisticated operations attempted daily by Russia and other foreign governments. The attackers weren\u2019t attempting to exploit any flaws or vulnerabilities in software but instead using \u201cwell-known\u201d techniques to steal credentials, the blog said.",

    "full_description": "Philips has revealed a pair of new \u2018Designed for Xbox \u2019 4K monitors, which are smaller \u2013 and (relatively) more affordable \u2013 models that will join the existing 55-inch offering , namely the Philips Momentum 559M1RYV. These will be the Philips Momentum 27-inch (279M1RV) and 32-inch (329M1RV) displays, and like the current 55-inch model which came out in August, they will offer a 4K HDR panel with a 120Hz refresh rate (with HDMI 2.1). The 32-inch model is VESA DisplayHDR 400 certified and has AMD FreeSync Premium tech on board, to minimize stuttering and tearing nastiness, but the 27-inch model doesn\u2019t have that feature (and is also rated differently at VESA DisplayHDR 600). Philips notes that these displays aren\u2019t just tailored for next-gen console gaming, but also good for PC gaming, with the 27-inch model being a good fit for a desktop and a commonly used size with PC gamers. The manufacturer highlights that the 279M1RV has a Nano IPS panel with up to 98% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage, and that it\u2019s a G-Sync compatible monitor for those with Nvidia GPUs in their gaming rigs. Other notable inclusions are Philips Ambiglow (color-matching backlighting), DTS Sound, and there are adjustments for height, tilt, and swivel (plus cable management chops too). The new offerings will go on sale in November in the UK with a recommended price of \u00a3899.99 and \u00a3719.99 for the 32-inch and 27-inch monitors respectively. That compares to the asking price of \u00a31,199 for the 55-inch model which is already on sale, although bear in mind that panel is also equipped with an impressive built-in soundbar (it is, of course, a much bigger monitor). It\u2019s always good to have more options, and these smaller-sized monitors in the Philips Momentum range offer a more approachable price tag \u2013 although they\u2019re still far from cheap (but then, this is a quality 4K screen with a 120Hz refresh rate). They also represent a potential choice for PC gamers with Philips angling them like so, particularly the 27-inch model which is a good size to sit on a desk. The good news is that its IPS panel should make things better on the picture quality front, compared to the previous VA screen with the 55-inch product, which as we saw in our sister site GamesRadar\u2019s review , was disappointing when it came to viewing angles (and notably on the PC, lacked the punch and vibrancy seen on the Xbox). The new Nano IPS panel will offer much better viewing angles, and hopefully a more vivid performance on the color front, too. As always, we won\u2019t really know the truth of exactly what the new models bring to the table until they start being reviewed, but the developments here sound promising enough.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Founder & CEO of TimeXtender , leading a global effort to empower business people with instant access to quality data. getty Have you ever considered expanding your business into a new geographic region? At my company, TimeXtender, we have, on numerous occasions, opened offices across various parts of the world. Expanding your business into new markets is a very exciting endeavor, but it does come with some risks. Over the years, we\u2019ve learned a few valuable lessons along with pitfalls to avoid about expansion. I thought it would be helpful to share some of these successful business practices that I believe are essential for any company looking to grow by entering new geographic business markets. 1. Location, Location, Location A lot of companies choose a location for new expansion based on personal preference and comfort over what\u2019s truly best for the business. For example, many European companies expanding to the U.S. choose the East Coast because it\u2019s the shortest distance between the two continents. This is not strategic. You have to think beyond convenience to something of greater importance such as the business community that would be conducive for recruiting staff, building partnerships and networking. 2. Building-Blocks Approach Once you have designated your new region, commence by finding a starting point and building out from there. This connection to get activities moving could be a new customer, partner or consultant. Use that relationship as a launching pad to build step by step and achieve success progressively. This is a much shrewder approach than stating, \u201cLet\u2019s go global,\u201d or, \u201cLet\u2019s open up a new division,\u201d and proceeding by simply opening a new office and trying to create this new footprint with no business foundation or support system in place. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event 3. Become Local It\u2019s very difficult to simply take a successful business from one area and launch it in another market to try and duplicate your previous success in the same manner. What is logical is to adapt your organization to its new home by \u201cbecoming local.\u201d Develop a plan to acclimate to the local business environment, as many people want to do business with companies that have established local roots. It\u2019s important that the leader be open-minded to enable adaptability within the region. Hire people who share your vision and possess the skills for achieving localization. And hire from the top so that this lead person can recruit the right staff and align the company with regional culture. Launching with a localization strategy also teaches you how to customize locally for other areas in the country or other parts of the world. 4. Focus On Your Core Business Outsourcing business activities that are not related to your core competencies is crucial. As a CEO, you need to focus on growing your business and the top-level initiatives that go along with it. You won\u2019t have the time to learn all the intricacies of regional laws and regulations when opening a new office. Find local, trusted advisors in HR, legal and accounting to roll out these programs on your behalf. You could spend all your time researching these efforts and filling out documents only to find out many were done incorrectly. 5. Establish Your Corporate Culture When having offices in different regions with people from various backgrounds, it\u2019s essential to formulate a cohesive corporate culture across your expanded corporation. You\u2019ll need a unifying message that builds camaraderie and brings people together with a bigger purpose and mission for all to aim for. We\u2019ve found that implementing virtual sessions for weekly breakfast roundtables and recharge sessions for mindfulness, meditation, exercise, stretching and strengthening allow for a common theme and shared practices to bring staff together. Many organizations neglect to invest in their employees because they are focused on saving time and money or getting the next sale. But your business is comprised of people and avoiding culture-based programs can lead to greater costs in the form of poor communication, work inefficiencies or employee turnover. 6. Utilize Technology You\u2019ll need to communicate across time zones, prioritize initiatives, work on messaging and share information. Technology enhances productivity and cuts across regional barriers. To maximize your investment, minimize IT support and training costs, and maintain flexibility and agility, consider licensing cloud solutions and other modern technology. The cloud provides adaptation for various departmental requirements and provides flexibility to license new technology in the future. It can provide a safe and secure 24/7 online home for employees to work around the world. Furthermore, other types of online technology are available for project management, team conferencing, access to documentation and more. 7. Set The Business Pace Treat your new location as a startup, not as a mature company \u2014 despite your previous successes. Time is 100% perishable, so all should strive for being efficient and productive every day. You want to be fast, agile and results-oriented \u2014 operating with a touch of startup mode. Don\u2019t get bogged down in bureaucratic measures often used by bloated companies; rather, focus on today to make a bigger impact tomorrow. Maintain and flourish with an entrepreneurial mindset that is thinking one step ahead. 8. Keep Eyes On Your Vision The entrepreneurial leader should sustain a focus on the company\u2019s vision and avoid acting as a micromanager (this is why you hire good people). Rather, spend energy understanding the future and how the company can prosper. The CEO is the internal and external entrepreneurial leader of the company who sets the vision, the mission, and the work ethic, and the new office manager is the local leader on the ground. Just make sure your team is free from work obstacles and is empowered to communicate openly by putting egos aside and ensuring that all are always motivated to pursue the corporate vision and purpose. Expanding your business into a new geographic region can be rewarding and prosperous once established and a sales pipeline is put into place. These eight methods are just some of the lessons that we have learned over the years on helping to establish the opening and sustainability of a new corporate location into a new global region.

    "full_description": "BERLIN -- A target for rich countries to provide poor nations with US$100 billion in aid each year to tackle global warming will be missed, officials said Monday, dealing a blow to the upcoming UN climate talks in Glasgow. Senior officials from Canada and Germany who were tasked with breaking a deadlock in negotiations ahead of next week's summit announced that current data shows the goal won't be reached until 2023 -- three years later than agreed. \"While developed countries have significantly scaled up their support over the last decade, new analysis shows the $100 billion goal was unlikely to have been met in 2020 and is likely to also fall short in 2021 and 2022,\" the officials said in a statement. Sign up here to receive The Climate Barometer, delivering climate and environmental news to your inbox every week They expressed confidence that \"developed countries can mobilize more than $100 billion per year\" from 2024 onward, but that is unlikely to satisfy poor nations, who have insisted that the original target must be met. \"The $100 billion of climate finance is not only a lifeline to poor and vulnerable communities on the front line of a climate crisis they did not cause, it's also the bare minimum that rich countries need to do to hold up their end of the bargain at COP26,\" said Mohamed Adow, director of Nairobi-based environmental think tank Power Shift Africa. Adow warned the plan now submitted to the U.K. to take to the COP26 talks in Glasgow should not be considered \"mission accomplished.\" \"Poor nations will not be conned and the leaders of the developed world need to ... get this money on the table if COP26 is going to be a success,\" he said.

    "full_description": "After being announced last week and ahead of the first orders arriving to customers tomorrow, the early reviews of the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are here. These reviews provide our first in-depth looks at the new design and notch, the ProMotion display technology, the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, and more. Head below for the full details\u2026 MacBook Pro reviews The Verge has some early results from testing the M1 Max chip inside the new 16-inch MacBook Pro: Inside you\u2019ve got Apple\u2019s new M1 Pro and M1 Max processors, which are much more powerful versions of the M1 chip that have much more serious GPU capabilities. We\u2019re doing a lot of performance tests to see what\u2019s what with these chips, but I can tell you right now that the 16-inch Pro with M1 Max clocked the fastest time ever in our Adobe Premiere 4K export test\u2026 by over a minute. What the notch that lives in the top of the new displays? Jason Snell at SixColors writes that it takes \u201cno time to get used to having a notch at the top of the display.\u201d As Snell explains, this is due primarily to the Mac\u2019s menu bar: You could imagine this notch being a major pain point for developers and users alike, but it\u2019s not. And that\u2019s thanks to the menu bar, a Mac convention since day one that provides the perfect place to hide a display cutout. The menu bar has been given a little extra height to completely encompass the notch, and menu items automatically move to the other side of the chasm if there isn\u2019t room for them to fit. It takes no time to get used to having a notch at the top of the display. And it\u2019s a good use of space since moving the menu bar up into what would otherwise have been unused bezel means that there\u2019s more room downstairs for everything else. (I see now why Apple changed the metrics on the menu bar in macOS Big Sur\u2014it was clearly laying the groundwork for this display. Add in the curved-edge highlights that appear when you click on a menu-bar item and the whole approach really looks great.) Gizmodo describes the return of the SD card slot, MagSafe, and HDMI port as a \u201cgame changer.\u201d The return of useful ports to the MacBook Pro is a game-changer if you use a lot of peripherals as part of your workflow. Both MacBook Pros have three Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) ports, a headphone jack, an HDMI port, an SD card slot, and a MagSafe charging port, which is so, so satisfying to use. (You can also charge over USB-C.) I\u2019d love to see a USB-A port crammed in here, too, but the included ports minimize the need for dongles and for that, I am grateful (if a little upset that I settled for only USB-C for so long). Gizmodo also says that the new 120Hz ProMotion display is incredibly impressive: The new Pro displays have also been upgraded with the iPad Pro\u2019s ProMotion feature, which is so good that it\u2019s now upsetting to use a laptop without it. ProMotion, which is turned on by default, makes it so the Pro can adjust its refresh rate between 10Hz and 120Hz, depending on what you\u2019re doing. You can turn off ProMotion and use the Pro at a fixed refresh rate (47.95Hz, 48Hz, 50Hz, 59.94Hz, or 60Hz) if you want to, but I tried using it at 60Hz and found the difference too glaring after almost a week at 120Hz. It really is so much smoother with ProMotion turned on. CNBC has some praise for the new speakers: The speakers are way better than any other laptop speaker I\u2019ve tested. They have a noticeably rich bass and can fill a room with audio. They support spatial audio, too, which is like surround sound if you\u2019re playing movies or music encoded with Dolby Atmos. It makes a movie or music sound like it\u2019s coming from all around instead of just from the left or right of the laptop. Pocket-Lint on the M1 Pro processor: This machine laughs in the face of big files and demanding apps. In testing, a 31GB cinema 4D file opens almost instantly and allows you to render effects in real-time. We couldn\u2019t even open it on our M1-powered 13-inch model. Likewise, a 1594 track Pro Logic file opens in less than 20 seconds. Those wanting to edit video on the go shouldn\u2019t have a problem either. The M1 Pro can handle up to 20 streams of 4K ProRes footage at the same time, while the M1 Max can handle 30 streams. Engadget was impressed with the battery life: Surprisingly, I didn\u2019t notice a huge difference in performance when I was running the MacBook Pros on battery. PCs often slow down dramatically whenever they\u2019re disconnected from a socket, but not so with these notebooks. That\u2019s useful if you need to encode something remotely and you\u2019re willing to sacrifice battery life to get it done. Don\u2019t worry though, the efficiency of the M1 chip\u2019s ARM design leads to great battery performance. The 14-inch MacBook Pro lasted 12 hours and 35 minutes in our benchmark, while the 16-inch went for 16 hours and 34 minutes. That\u2019s over five hours longer than the last Intel model. In addition to the longer battery life, the new MacBook Pros can also charge faster than their predecessors thanks to the return of MagSafe. As TechCrunch explains: The notion that the system doesn\u2019t get hot is overstated \u2014 the bottom of the aluminum case gets toasty, but what is true is that you\u2019re going to have to really push this system to get those fans to kick in. The battery life is beefy on this thing well. I was able to squeeze out 17:29 hours of Apple TV+ playback on a charge (the new Velvet Underground documentary is good. I know because I watched it A LOT). The reintroduction of MagSafe, meanwhile, brings fast charging, getting the system from zero to 50% battery in half an hour (with the 96 or 140W power adapter). The system can still be charged via one of the three USB-C ports (great for those times when you inevitably leave the proprietary plug at home), albeit not as quickly, topping out at 100W. The MagSafe plug comes with a nice new braided cable, but otherwise looks and functions remarkably similarly to the quick detaching plug we all know and mostly love.

The video below sets the scene for the campaign, which sees Master Chief fight back against the Banished forces on Zeta Halo. Watch on YouTube The campaign, visually at least, seems to be in better shape than it did last summer. There's plenty of trademark Halo chaos, which incorporates the tools players got their hands on during the recent multiplayer technical preview events. There's a Tacmap, which displays objectives: There's an upgrades tab, too: It all feels a bit Ubisoft open-world trademark. There are Banished strongholds for you to take down, and you can spawn vehicles from orbit. Story wise, you're trying to work out what's going on with Cortana, who's a villain now. You've got a new mysterious AI called The Weapon to help you out. There are plenty of familiar Covenant enemies to fight. Is this the new and improved Craig? There are a few new enemies, too, such as the agile Skimmers: A sadistic Spartan killer called Jega 'Rdomnai: And The Harbinger of the Truth, who doesn't seem to like the Forerunners - or Chief: Halo Infinite comes out 8th December.",

    "full_description": "Cyberpunk dystopias, mechs, and sci-fi motorcycles - these are the best sci-fi anime movies and shows out there. Anime is an expansive medium. Despite years of being considered a niche medium reserved for nerds, anime has now broached the mainstream. Thanks to online services, and a broader understanding, it\u2019s not unusual to find relatives or friends who are into anime these days without them considering anime to be cartoons for children. Even if you\u2019re not into anime, there are some true sci-fi classics out there that you really shouldn\u2019t miss. From adult-focused series to family movies, sci-fi has had an enormous impact on Japanese animation, and that has led to some truly great content for everyone to enjoy. The only problem is that sci-fi has had such a significant impact on anime that trying to figure out which ones are the must-see shows and movies is quite an undertaking. That\u2019s where we come in. With this list, we hope to give you a comprehensive guide to the best classic sci-fi anime for you to try, even if you\u2019re not an anime fan already. Once you\u2019ve finished the stuff on this list, you also might want to check out some of our best space anime recommendations as well. Promare is only a couple of years old, but it\u2019s hard not to see this as a classic in the making. Promare tells the story of a future ravaged by dangerous people who spontaneously developed pyrokinetic powers during a great calamity that destroyed half of the world\u2019s population. A firefighting team, known as Burning Rescue, works to stop these pyrokinetics from destroying the city or people\u2019s lives. The storyline of Promare has a lot to offer. It\u2019s action-packed, has an exciting premise, and remains engaging throughout. The real star here, though, is the visual style. One of the companies behind the film, Trigger, is well-known for its incredibly kinetic visual style, and Promare is the most polished and refined it\u2019s ever been. Everything looks fantastic, from the intense action scenes to wacky comedy moments and has such a unique style that you\u2019re not likely to forget this film anytime soon. Famed director Satoshi Kon had a knack for making unique films. Paprika is possibly one of the most visually interesting things he ever produced and follows the story of a future where scientists have discovered a way of viewing people\u2019s dreams. One of the doctors uses the device to try and help psychiatric patients, but the machine goes haywire over time, causing dreams and reality to merge and wreak havoc across the city. Paprika is a treat for the eyes as well as for the mind. The storyline itself is interesting, but when you throw in the insane trippy scenes that visualize a person\u2019s dreams, the movie becomes a fever-dream that it\u2019s impossible to stop watching. So if you\u2019re ready to be completely mesmerized by a film, then strap in for the ride of your life and watch Paprika. This is a name that many people may already be familiar with, mainly because it was recently made into a big-budget Hollywood movie. While that version may not have been amazing, the original is stunning. Ghost in the Shell tells the story of Major Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg public defence officer who must hunt down a dangerous hacker before he can enact a sinister plot against the people of her city. Much like Akira, Ghost in the Shell also has stunning visuals of a cyberpunk city throughout. However, the main draw that sets Ghost in the Shell apart is its themes. The central concept at play here is self-identity in a world filled with technologically enhanced people. At various times, the question of \u201cwhat even is a human?\u201d comes up, and honestly, after watching this one, you might struggle to answer it yourself. Even better, there\u2019s a follow-up movie to enjoy and three seasons of a show, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, if you\u2019re longing for more. If you\u2019re more in the mood for something that you can watch in a single sitting, then you should consider Akira. This movie tells the story of a not-so-distant-anymore future and revolves around a Japanese teenage biker gang called a B\u014ds\u014dzoku. The leader of the gang, Kaneda, and his best friend, Tetsuo, spend their nights violently racing through the streets and their days being delinquents. However, events start to spiral when Tetsuo acquires telekinetic powers during a battle against another gang, resulting in him becoming a threat to the entirety of Neo-Tokyo. The well-written storyline and interesting characters are part of the reason why Akira is such a well-loved film, but the key elements here are the visuals and style. The futuristic city of Neo-Tokyo is perfectly captured, leaving you with nighttime scenes awash with the high-contrast glow of neon lights and daytime scenes of a washed-out city on the brink of falling apart. Not only is this a great sci-fi movie, but it\u2019s also one of the main reasons that anime became such a success outside of Japan in the first place. If you\u2019ve never heard of Neon Genesis Evangelion, then you\u2019ve not been hanging around anime fans much. Neon Genesis Evangelion is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi story about a world ravaged by giant monsters called Angels. To combat these monsters, humanity has formed Nerv, a paramilitary force with giant robots known as Evangelions, or just Evas for short. The story revolves around the lives of three teenagers in charge of piloting the Evas to protect what\u2019s left of humanity, dealing with their interpersonal struggles in one of the most tumultuous times of their lives. There are several reasons why Evangelion is considered a classic. Firstly, the franchise focuses on characters rather than solely on the incredible visuals and intense fight scenes between giant monsters. There is plenty of that as well, of course, but the cerebral storyline and the themes of depression, coming-of-age, and strong use of religious imagery really does elevate the show and movies into the realms of true art.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin CEO and co-founder of Wistia . getty Have you ever spent months creating a video for your business with the goal of generating a ton of leads \u2014 only to watch the interest fizzle out? It\u2019s so frustrating, right? Because even if your video gets a ton of views, it may not be optimized to generate business. I\u2019ve personally experienced what it\u2019s like to invest time and effort on a video that seems to be working based on plays. But then you discover it\u2019s not actually doing anything to drive business. If you feel like you\u2019re having a hard time getting leads from your videos, you\u2019re not alone. According to Wyzowl (via HubSpot ), \u201c92% of video marketers feel the levels of noise and competition have increased in the last year.\u201d It can be really tough to stand out. So, how can you make sure your videos are getting views and conversions? To start, don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. It\u2019s a good idea to remember that video conversion rates aren\u2019t wildly high. In fact, in the retail industry alone, the average conversion rate is only 10%. But even the most modest conversion rates can help you reach your goals. Here are a few helpful tips for giving your videos an edge: 1. Define And Track Your Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event To pull off lead generation with video, you\u2019ll need to track a variety of video performance metrics \u2014 not just views. You need to be very deliberate with the KPIs that you follow. While KPIs like view count and social sharing are good for measuring reach, they don\u2019t offer much insight into lead generation potential. Like with all marketing efforts, you don\u2019t need to track every single KPI imaginable. But it\u2019s important to select a few metrics that will give you insight into videos with the most potential for getting you leads. A few KPIs that fit the bill include: \u2022 Conversion rate , which is the percentage of viewers who take action on your video, like clicking a link or filling out a form. Conversion rates tell you how effective your video is in generating leads based on the content. \u2022 Engagement rate , which is the percentage of a video a viewer watches. This metric can help you narrow down potential lead quality. The more of a video your viewer watches, the more likely it is that they have a chance at becoming a solid lead. \u2022 Play rate , which is the percentage of page visitors who clicked \u201cPlay\u201d and started watching a video. This is a good one for finding out if your video is drawing your audience in \u2014 whether that\u2019s through enticing thumbnails, descriptions or a prominent spot on your site. While it may be tempting to track more KPIs, the ones above are a great place to start. By looking at each of these distinct rates, you\u2019ll get a broader sense of where your videos are performing and how they are generating leads. 2. Add Variety Into Your Video Marketing Strategy Next, B2B marketers should attempt to implement various types of marketing content. What\u2019s one of the simplest ways to pull this off? Add more variety to the videos you use throughout your marketing funnel. Here are some examples: \u2022 Customer testimonials These videos are valuable because they point to your excellent track record with past customers while clearly painting a picture of what problems can be solved by using your product. To create your own, get a real customer who is representative of your audience. Your customers want to be able to see themselves in your brand. Present a specific problem that your product can solve better than anything else, back up promises with evidence and demonstrate key benefits in action. \u2022 An educational series Educational videos should be a core part of your overall content strategy. They\u2019re essential for helping your prospects and customers get to know \u2014 and fall in love with \u2014 your brand. Want to educate your audience on a particular concept? You have to think outside the blog. Instead of long-form written content, create a short video and make it into a series. More times than not, you\u2019ll see higher engagement rates and you\u2019ll also build credibility. \u2022 Product tutorials If you aren\u2019t already creating product tutorials, I suggest you start now. Product tutorials help your existing and future customers understand the value of your solutions and their benefits. Not only can product tutorials build trust with your customers, but you can use viewing data to trigger sales outreach based on who is watching what. 3. Retarget Ads Based On Video Audience Behaviors It happens all the time: A potential customer comes to your site, watches a video and then exits the page. Yes, this is brutal when it happens, but all hope is not lost. Using the information you\u2019ve gotten from measuring video performance, you can set up retargeting ads to direct viewers back to your brand. Retargeting is a more nuanced approach that serves more relevant ad content based on behavior \u2014 resulting in a better customer experience. Retargeting ads can help you move leads down your marketing funnel. All you need to do is link your video performance data \u2014 like conversions or engagement \u2014 with an ad retargeting provider. Whether you want to reach an entirely new audience or retarget to video viewers, an ad retargeting provider can feed this data over to third parties to build custom lists. Once complete, you can create custom video segments based on those metrics. Viewers of your videos will start seeing your ads on different channels, prompting them to visit your website to learn more. Video is an effective tool to guide prospects through your B2B marketing funnel, and it\u2019s an exciting way to really get to know your audience. So, to get leads across the finish line from your videos, make sure you focus on tracking your KPIs, learning as much as you can about your viewers and diversifying your video content. And by enhancing your lead generation strategy, your business will be sure to see all that hard work pay off.

Initial reports published today include confirmation that CEO Mark Zuckerberg was fully aware of the way in which the social media platform was contributing to the polarization that played a significant role in leading to the US insurrection. The Washington Post reports that the growing problem was discussed by senior execs, including Zuckerberg. One particular internal study cited by the NYT says that the company was fully aware that it was accelerating the spread of hate speech by making the material easy to share. Facebook has scrutinized its share button, which lets users instantly spread content posted by other people; its groups feature, which is used to form digital communities; and other tools that define how more than 3.5 billion people behave and interact online. The research, laid out in thousands of pages of internal documents, underlines how the company has repeatedly grappled with what it has created. What researchers found was often far from positive. Time and again, they determined that people misused key features or that those features amplified toxic content, among other effects. In an August 2019 internal memo, several researchers said it was Facebook\u2019s \u201ccore product mechanics\u201d \u2014 meaning the basics of how the product functioned \u2014 that had let misinformation and hate speech flourish on the site [\u2026] \u201cIf integrity takes a hands-off stance for these problems, whether for technical (precision) or philosophical reasons, then the net result is that Facebook, taken as a whole, will be actively (if not necessarily consciously) promoting these types of activities. The mechanics of our platform are not neutral.\u201d In particular, says Politico , the company knew of the danger of the material that incited the insurrection at the US Capitol building, but had no strategy in place to address it. Internal company documents show Facebook had no clear playbook for handling some of the most dangerous material on its platform: content delegitimizing the US elections. Such claims fell into a category of \u201charmful non-violating narratives\u201d that stopped just short of breaking any rules. Without set policies for how to deal with those posts during the 2020 cycle, Facebook\u2019s engineers and other colleagues were left scrambling to respond to the fast-escalating riot at the Capitol \u2014 a breakdown that triggered outrage across the company\u2019s ranks, the documents show. Politico also reports that the Facebook Papers show the company was in no doubt about its massively influential role in the US. The internal metrics show that 78% of American adults and nearly all US teenagers use the company\u2019s services. Things were even worse outside the US, says a Reuters report. Facebook employees have warned for years that as the company raced to become a global service it was failing to police abusive content in countries where such speech was likely to cause the most harm, according to interviews with five former employees and internal company documents viewed by Reuters [\u2026] Internal company documents viewed by Reuters show Facebook has known that it hasn\u2019t hired enough workers who possess both the language skills and knowledge of local events needed to identify objectionable posts from users in a number of developing countries [\u2026] Those shortcomings, employees warned in the documents, could limit the company\u2019s ability to make good on its promise to block hate speech and other rule-breaking posts in places from Afghanistan to Yemen. There\u2019s much more out there on the Facebook Papers, including a CNN report that says Facebook failed to block material related to human trafficking, and there will undoubtedly be much more to come as journalists continue to work their way through them.

NASA is paying $93.3 million for this Blue Ghost mission, which will carry 10 payloads down to the Mare Crisium lunar basin in September 2023. Further Reading For lunar cargo delivery, NASA accepts risk in return for low prices \"We got through the critical design review process in eight months, which is a very fast pace for sending something to the surface of the Moon,\" William Coogan, Blue Ghost's chief engineer, told Ars. The lander is sized like a large person, about 2 meters tall, and capable of carrying 155 kg of payload to the Moon's surface. From the time that NASA ordered the mission, Firefly will have had about 2.5 years to design and build the lander, Coogan said. He is most excited about the spacecraft's potential to stream high-definition video from the surface of the Moon at 10 megabits per second. One camera, at the top of the spacecraft, will be set to track to Earth as it moves over the Moon, and its eclipse as it sets over the horizon. Coogan said he is eager to share such a view of our home planet with the entire world. Advertisement To date, NASA has selected six missions as part of the innovative commercial lunar payload program. The first two of these, built separately by Astrobotic and Intuitive Machines, may launch in 2022. If Blue Ghost holds to its production schedule, it should be the third or fourth private US mission to land on the Moon. Firefly started as a launch company and attempted its first Alpha rocket launch in early September. The rocket failed after one of its first-stage engines shut off only seconds after launch, but the company is already well on its way toward a second attempt, said CEO Tom Markusic. The company plans to deliver hardware for its second flight to the launch site at Vandenberg Space Force Base in December and may attempt a launch as early as January 2022. The company's rocket production process is strongly vertically integrated, so developing Blue Ghost has been a challenge in that it relies more heavily on external partners, Markusic said. For example, the spacecraft's engines are being built by a Ukrainian company, Flight Control . And the supply chain issues that have struck other industries have hit the aerospace sector as well. Enlarge / The Blue Ghost team is shown in front of actual-size spacecraft models. Firefly Aerospace \"I'd say the supply chain is my biggest concern, but it\u2019s not a serious concern,\" Markusic said about Blue Ghost's scheduled launch and lunar landing. \"The way we\u2019ve mitigated that is we\u2019ve picked good partners and we\u2019ve watched them carefully. Overall I feel good.\" Although he began Firefly to launch rockets, Markusic said he has realized that to scale in the space industry, a company needs to do more than launch. SpaceX, for example, has diversified beyond launch with its Dragon spacecraft and Starlink satellite businesses. So in addition to developing a larger \"Beta\" rocket and the Blue Ghost lander, Firefly is also working on an in-space utility vehicle. The privately held company completed a round of Series A funding earlier this year and aims to raise an additional $100 million or more by the first quarter of 2023 to fund its ongoing development activities.",

    "full_description": "In one of nature's unexpected bounties, a harmless food-grade solvent has been used to extract highly sought rare-earth metals from coal ash, reducing the amount of ash without damaging the environment and at the same time increasing an important national resource. Coal ash is the unwanted but widely present residue of coal-fired power. Rare-earth metals are used for a variety of high-tech equipment from smartphones to submarines. The separation method , which uses carbon dioxide , water and food-grade citric acid, is the subject of a Sandia National Laboratories patent application. \"This technique not only recovers rare-earth metals in an environmentally harmless manner but would actually improve environments by reducing the toxicity of coal waste dotting America,\" said Guangping Xu, lead Sandia researcher on the project. \"Harmless extraction of rare-earth metals from coal ash not only provides a national source of materials essential for computer chips, smart phones and other high-tech products\u2014including fighter jets and submarines\u2014but also makes the coal ash cleaner and less toxic, enabling its direct reuse as concrete filler or agricultural topsoil,\" he said. The method, if widely adopted, could make coal ash, currently an environmental pariah, into a commercially viable product, Xu said. Environmentally friendly method for mining rare-earth metals The most common acids used as chemical separators in mining\u2014nitric, sulfuric or phosphoric acids\u2014also are able to extract rare-earth metals from coal ash but produce large amounts of acid waste, leaving the environment in worse shape than before, Xu said. \"Environmentally harmful acids would raise clean-up costs beyond economic feasibility in the United States.\" The Sandia process, which uses citric acid as a carrier for rare-earth metals, so they separate from coal ash, the host material, was implemented by Xu. The extraction process is facilitated by using supercritical carbon dioxide solvent. Xu's Sandia colleague Yongliang Xiong suggested citric acid, a commonly used and environmentally friendly chemical for holding metals in solution. Xu found that in less than a day, at 158 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius) and 1,100 pounds per square inch pressure (about 70 times ordinary atmospheric pressure), the method extracted 42% of rare-earth metals present in coal waste samples. Chinese mines, where 95% of the world's resources of rare-earth metals are located, achieve less efficient separation while using environmentally damaging methods. \"Theoretically, an American company could use this technique to mine coal and coal byproducts for rare-earth metals and compete with Chinese mining,\" said Xu. Furthermore, for U.S. national security purposes \"it is probably reasonable to have alternate sources of rare-earth metals to avoid being at the mercy of a foreign supply.\" Detoxifying coal ash for reuse alone should be worth the effort, Xu said. There's no shortage of coal ash as a raw material. According to a paper published in 2016 in the journal Environmental Science & Technology , \"Approximately 115 million metric tons of coal combustion products are generated annually, and this sum includes 45 million tons of fly ash,\" the lightest kind of coal ash. These numbers remain of interest today, said Xu. \"If we don't detoxify and reuse the coal ash , then it will be abandoned in ponds and landfills and cost billions of dollars to clean up over the long term,\" he said. To help make that outcome less likely, \"We expect tests of our extraction techniques at larger volumes and on a variety of coal -based sources in the near future.\" Carbon sequestration also a possibility This technology also could open a new avenue for carbon-dioxide reutilization and sequestration, said Xu's Sandia colleague Mark Rigali, who with Xu is exploring the use of citric acid and supercritical carbon dioxide to mine metals from oil and gas shales that are often rich in metals. \"Using existing oil and gas fracking wells, the citric acid and supercritical carbon dioxide can be used cost-effectively to mine metals while disposing of carbon dioxide below ground,\" Rigali said. Subsurface storage of the carbon dioxide should keep it from entering the atmosphere and contributing to climate change, Rigali said. Explore further",

Many dangerous chemicals continue to be unregulated due to the weakness of the rules and the political power exerted by chemical companies. New drugs are subject to rules based on the precautionary principle, while new chemicals are not. Last week, the Biden Administration took a small step toward regulating some of the more persistent and dangerous chemicals in wide use. As Lisa Friedman of the New York Times reported on October 20: \"The Biden administration on Monday said it would require chemical manufacturers to test and publicly report the amount of a family of chemicals known as PFAS that is contained in household items like tape, nonstick pans and stain-resistant furniture, the first step toward reducing their presence in drinking water. Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl compounds, or PFAS refers to more than 4,000 man-made chemicals that are often called \"forever chemicals\" because they don't break down in the environment. Exposure to the chemicals has been linked to certain cancers, weakened immunity, thyroid disease, and other health effects.\" There is disagreement between industry and environmental activists about the danger posed by these chemicals, and we are hearing the usual debate about how much to regulate and what rules should be employed. Friedman's report included a response from the American Chemistry Council, which stated that: \"\u2026about 600 chemicals in the PFAS category are used to manufacture products like solar panels and cellphones, and\u2026 alternative materials might not be available to replace them. \"The American Chemistry Council supports the strong, science-based regulation of chemicals, including PFAS substances. But all PFAS are not the same, and they should not all be regulated the same way,\" Erich Shea, a spokesman for the organization, said in a statement.\" On the other side, as Joseph Winters wrote in Grist, some environmental advocates see EPA's approach as inadequate to the task. In his Grist piece, Winters reports that EPA's strategy is to: \"\u2026invest in research to better understand the compounds, restrict PFAS from contaminating the environment, and work to clean up highly polluted areas. By the end of 2021, he said, chemical manufacturers will be required to test and report concentrations for 20 subcategories of PFAS in consumer goods. The EPA will also set enforceable drinking water standards for two of the worst PFAS\u2014known as PFOA and PFOS\u2014and finalize its toxicity assessments for six additional compounds. Some activists lauded the roadmap as a win for environmental justice; PFAS tends to contaminate impoverished neighborhoods and communities of color \u2026 But other environmental advocates have said the plan doesn't go far enough.\" One advocate quoted by Winters derided EPA's move as a \"plan to plan.\" Others considered the water quality standards inadequate given the toxicity of some of these chemicals. All in all, this is shaping up as a standard industry-environmentalist toxics conflict. EPA's hand in regulating these chemicals is weakened by a statutory framework established in the 1970s and 1980s that has not kept up with the exponential increase and vast complexity of new chemicals . These chemicals are central to many products in everyday use and industry is correct when they claim that the application of the precautionary principle to chemical introduction would stifle innovation and impair economic growth. Moreover, if the U.S. regulates these substances and other nations do not, the chemical research and manufacturing would simply move to less regulated nations. Still, we are making a choice to slowly poison the planet. And while the spread is slow, it is picking up speed. The chemicals under question here are designed to be durable. They do not biodegrade. They are called \"forever chemicals\" for a reason. Like greenhouse gasses that continue to accumulate in the atmosphere, these chemicals continue to contaminate our ecosystems, water, and air. They are transported through the food chain, ultimately ending up in human bodies. The more of this stuff we make, the more of it remains in our biosphere. The issue is not simply its use in products but the effluents and emissions created when these durable chemicals are added to a manufacturing process. The chemicals don't only end up on the frying pans and solar cells, but in the water and air as well. Despite these issues, the steps taken by EPA are significant and worthy of support. For new rules to survive the inevitable legal challenges brought by chemical manufacturers such as 3M, they need to be carefully developed and based on sound and thorough scientific study. This work takes time, and the half-century-long history of American environmental regulation demonstrates that while the process is slow, it is effective. Requiring industry study and disclosure is an important step. Companies can't contest their own studies in court. Still, environmental regulation is not a rapid process. The slow pace can be frustrating. The long regulatory process is not entirely dysfunctional since it provides industry with time to adapt and innovate. It allows researchers time to fully understand the impact of toxic substances. Some of the toxic policies developed to implement laws enacted in the 1970s were not formally promulgated as regulations until the 1990s. But industry knew they were coming, substitutes were found, and the economic impact was often slight. Unfortunately, for every toxic chemical that was finally regulated, 1,000 new ones were introduced with unknown levels of environmental impact. The pace of technological innovation is too rapid for the current regulatory structure to control. Complaining that EPA is not doing enough is attacking the wrong target. The problem is in congress, and we need a more effective form of regulatory control than the one now in place. I would start by revising our toxic substance laws to require industry to study and report (to the public) the environmental and health impacts of new chemicals before they are used. Under the important action announced by EPA Administrator Michael Regan last week, EPA is requiring chemical producers to study and disclose these impacts long after the chemicals have been introduced into widespread use. Even if the precautionary principle was not utilized, and companies were free to introduce new chemicals at will, at least the cost of research would be shifted to the private sector, and all new chemicals would be covered, not simply those already thought to be dangerous. Public disclosure would then provide the information base for EPA and advocates to focus their attention on the most dangerous chemicals . EPA could build staff to audit industry's environment and health impact studies to reinforce the need for sound science. Given the current authority and political reality, EPA's actions should be applauded as a long overdue and important step. But many decades after toxics substance, hazardous waste and toxic clean-up legislation was first enacted in the United States, we are long over-due for a major update of those laws. We need to encourage chemical companies to internalize considerations of environmental impact into their search for new chemical combinations. When energy efficiency standards were added to electrical appliance design, engineers figured out creative ways to make air conditioners and refrigerators that used less energy. Let's provide similar incentives for those designing new chemicals. The best way to reduce environmental damage is to prevent it from being designed into new products. We are an ingenious species, and properly motivated, we can build an economy that doesn't poison people and the planet.

    "content": "It seems like every website has a chatbot of some kind to help answer simple questions without having to wait for a customer service representative. However, sometimes in the course of connecting it may take awhile, and as your attention shifts to something else, your time expires and you have to start all over again. AtomChat is developing conversational artificial intelligence software focused on improving sales team performance by converting more via asynchronous messaging in WhatsApp. To accelerate its product development and international expansion plans, it secured $3.15 million in seed funding led by Mucker Capital, with participation from Techstars. Erick Holmann and Rene Mouynes started the Panama City, Panama-based company in 2019 after working together for more than 15 years automating credit initiation processes for Citi and sales processes for telecommunications companies in Latin America. AtomChat messages. Image Credits: AtomChat AtomChat is their third startup, and their previous outbound sales company was the inspiration, Holmann told TechCrunch. Today, a majority of people in Latin America skip shopping on the web and instead use a combination of apps like WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, where 3.5 billion monthly users send 20 billion messages each month, he added. \u201cWe saw conversational commerce with messaging was going to be to sales what browsers were to the internet in the 1990s,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you have a question about a car, you engage with the dealer via messaging. Automation is what everyone wants, but needs to be more focused on customer services and the big gap is on the human side. Customers want more one-on-one time and assisted buying.\u201d The company enables its customers to connect ongoing conversations that take place over days, weeks or months so that any customer service representative has the history versus having to start over each time.

    "full_description": "It seems like every website has a chatbot of some kind to help answer simple questions without having to wait for a customer service representative. However, sometimes in the course of connecting it may take awhile, and as your attention shifts to something else, your time expires and you have to start all over again. AtomChat is developing conversational artificial intelligence software focused on improving sales team performance by converting more via asynchronous messaging in WhatsApp. To accelerate its product development and international expansion plans, it secured $3.15 million in seed funding led by Mucker Capital, with participation from Techstars. Erick Holmann and Rene Mouynes started the Panama City, Panama-based company in 2019 after working together for more than 15 years automating credit initiation processes for Citi and sales processes for telecommunications companies in Latin America. AtomChat messages. Image Credits: AtomChat AtomChat is their third startup, and their previous outbound sales company was the inspiration, Holmann told TechCrunch. Today, a majority of people in Latin America skip shopping on the web and instead use a combination of apps like WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, where 3.5 billion monthly users send 20 billion messages each month, he added. \u201cWe saw conversational commerce with messaging was going to be to sales what browsers were to the internet in the 1990s,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you have a question about a car, you engage with the dealer via messaging. Automation is what everyone wants, but needs to be more focused on customer services and the big gap is on the human side. Customers want more one-on-one time and assisted buying.\u201d The company enables its customers to connect ongoing conversations that take place over days, weeks or months so that any customer service representative has the history versus having to start over each time.

    "content": "The reaction among TechCrunch staff was swift and, best I can tell, universal. I don\u2019t recall the last time I saw so many colleagues legitimately excited for one specific new feature. MagSafe is back. Not the iPhone version (not to say that isn\u2019t without its own charm) \u2014 the original. The laptop version. The version that Apple unceremoniously abandoned in 2017, with the arrival of the all-USB-C/Thunderbolt MacBook. This is, I fully recognize, a strange place to begin a lengthy review of a new Pro-focused laptop. MagSafe is hardly the most important arrival on the 2021 MacBook Pro. That distinction almost certainly belongs to the new M1 Pro and Max chips. But the proprietary connector is an important microcosm. It\u2019s a crowd-pleaser for longtime devotees who have stuck with the line through port feast and port famine. The new model isn\u2019t a kitchen-sink laptop \u2014 Apple doesn\u2019t really do kitchen-sink devices. But, in addition to the new features, it finds the company returning some old favorites that many in the community no doubt feared were long gone. As the MacBook has evolved, features have come and gone. \u201cCourage,\u201d as the company infamously phrased it, when it dropped the headphone jack, back in 2016. That\u2019s one of many instances where Apple was clearly ahead of the curve. But that\u2019s the thing about courage. It doesn\u2019t always wind up the way you\u2019d expect. Image Credits: Brian Heater We as the consumers both demand change while complaining about it. We\u2019re tough to please. Sometimes, as in the case of the headphone jack and the disk drive before it, mainstream consumer use catches up, and for many, the features are hardly missed. Other times, the manufacturer was hasty. The move from USB-A to USB-C was clearly a sign of inevitable progress. But losing MagSafe hurt. The connector is, happily, back \u2014 in improved form. It\u2019s joined by an SD card slot (support for SD 4.0 standard, UHS-I and UHS-II SDXC cards), HDMI port and a row of function keys (replacing the beleaguered Touch Bar), which are all but gone from the current Mac lineup (with last year\u2019s 13-inch MacBook Pro serving as the final holdout).There are three USB-C ports on-board \u2014 down from four on 13-inch. One never wants to lose any ports, but many will no doubt view the return of HDMI and MagSafe as a fair tradeoff. Your mileage may vary. Apple has made a concerted effort to recapture the creative pros who, for years, have been fundamental to its computer lineup. And in many ways, the new Pro models represent the purest manifestation of that. They\u2019re powerful, hulking machines that look to the future of the Mac, while bringing back some hits from the past. With a year of hindsight, it seems entirely plausible that last year\u2019s 13-inch MacBook Pro will go down as a kind of curiosity, like the 2016 MacBook before it. The device is sticking around in the lineup for the time being, as a 13-inch sibling to the newly announced 14- and 16-inch models. It\u2019s a strange fit. The truth of it is that the 13-inch MacBook has more common DNA with the Air it was introduced alongside \u2014 a MacBook Pro Lite or MacBook Air+, perhaps. It was clear then that the distinction wasn\u2019t as pronounced as we\u2019ve come to expect between the two models, and the arrival of this year\u2019s Pro models have only served to highlight the gulf. The heart of the product is, of course, Apple\u2019s latest silicon. We expected a new chip in the lead up to this month\u2019s Unleashed event, but Apple managed to surprise us by dropping two, the M1 Pro and M1 Max. Both are effectively souped-up versions of the M1 (built on the same 5nm architecture), and for most users in most scenarios, the differences between the two variants will be negligible. Heck, for most users in most scenarios, the regular old M1 will get the job done. But the core demo that Apple is going after here isn\u2019t most users. It\u2019s the creator class, the people who regularly push their systems to the limit with 3D rendering, 8K video editing and other activities that might have seemed a near impossibility on a laptop a decade back. Image Credits: Apple Quickly: M1: 16 billion transistors, 8 CPU cores, 7/8 GPU cores, 68.25 GBps memory bandwidth, 16GB max memory M1 Pro: 33.7 billion transistors, 8/10CPU cores, 14/16 GPU cores, 200 GBps memory bandwidth, 32GB max memory M1 Max: 57 billion transistors, 10CPU cores, 24/32 GPU cores, 400 GBps memory bandwidth, 64GB max memory After Apple unveiled the Pro and Max, the immediate question was how the company would divvy up the two chips. Ultimately, I think the company did the right thing here, offering the Max as an upgrade for both systems, at $200. These things add up fast, of course, but welcome to the Apple.com shopping cart. The company sent along the M1 Max with a 10-core PU and 32-core GPU, 64GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. Memory options range from 16 to 64GB (the latter of which can only be had with the Max) and 512GB all the way up to 8TB. This system is $4,100 as configured. Bump it up to 8TB of storage and you get all the way up to $5,899 (if you go for the 16-inch, meanwhile, you can move the needle over $6,000). That\u2019s a $3,900 premium over the $1,999 entry price. The benchmark gains bear out the leap in specs. GeekBench\u2019s single-core test for Apple Silicon didn\u2019t see a massive gain, from 1711 on the 2020 MacBook Pro to 1781, but the multi-core score saw an impressive jump from 7549 to 12674. The GFXBench Metal graphics test, meanwhile, shows off the new GPU, jumping from 3490 frames (at 54.3 fps) to 7717.5 in the Aztec demo, and from 4981 frames (77.4 fps) to 17981 (279.6 fps) in the offscreen version. The system still lags some Nvidia GPUs in the former, but impressively outperforms others in the latter. What may be most remarkable among these numbers is the fact that Apple is capable of seeing big performance numbers with significantly less power consumption than much of the competition. Image Credits: Brian Heater The notion that the system doesn\u2019t get hot is overstated \u2014 the bottom of the aluminum case gets toasty, but what is true is that you\u2019re going to have to really push this system to get those fans to kick in. The battery life is beefy on this thing well. I was able to squeeze out 17:29 hours of Apple TV+ playback on a charge (the new Velvet Underground documentary is good. I know because I watched it A LOT). The reintroduction of MagSafe, meanwhile, brings fast charging, getting the system from zero to 50% battery in half an hour (with the 96 or 140W power adapter). The system can still be charged via one of the three USB-C ports (great for those times when you inevitably leave the proprietary plug at home), albeit not as quickly, topping out at 100W. The MagSafe plug comes with a nice new braided cable, but otherwise looks and functions remarkably similarly to the quick detaching plug we all know and mostly love. The MacBook also gets a design change to match its new internals. The 16-inch, for instance is thicker and heavier than its predecessor, bumping from 4.3 to 4.7 pounds and increasing from 0.64 to 0.66 inches thick. The 14-inch, meanwhile, weighs 3.5 pounds compared to the 13-inch\u2019s three, while maintaining the same thickness as its smaller sibling. As someone who\u2019s been carrying around the 2020 Air (on those occasions I actually leave my apartment), that\u2019s not an insignificant difference. While my wild speculation questions the future of the 13-inch MacBook (at least in its current form), it\u2019s hard to imagine the thinner, lighter Air going anywhere. Image Credits: Brian Heater The 14.2-inch display is big and bright, at 3024 x 1964. That comes in at 254 ppi to the 13-inch\u2019s 227. Last year\u2019s 500 nit brightness has increased to 1,000 nits sustained and up 1,600 peak brightness. That comes courtesy of a mini-LED array, with a 120Hz refresh rate (which adapts to suit the task, courtesy of ProMotion technology). The underlying tech is similar to what we saw on the most recent iPad Pro \u2014 and to date, a handful of laptops. Left: MacBook Air 2020, Right: MacBook Pro 2021 Thankfully, in this era of remote work, the FaceTime camera gets an upgrade, following in the footsteps of this year\u2019s new iMac with a 1080p camera. That\u2019s a nice upgrade from the 720p models we got on last year\u2019s Pro and Air, which largely relied on computational photography and improvements from the M1 to improve things like white balance and reduce image noise. As you can see above, it\u2019s a pretty dramatic improvement over the camera on the most recent Air. Image Credits: Brian Heater The bezels have been decreased by 24% over previous models. It\u2019s not quite an edge-to-edge display, but it\u2019s getting there. Along with that change came, perhaps, the most controversial addition, the dreaded notch. For a spirited assessment of the notch, read Devin\u2019s piece. I\u2019m mostly notch-agnostic, which is to say, obviously full screen would be best, but I also understand why they\u2019re a thing. It\u2019s something Apple has maintained on the iPhone since the introduction of the iPhone X four years ago. As the company noted at the event the other week, \u201cit\u2019s a really smart way to give you more space for your content, and when you\u2019re in full-screen mode, you have that 16:10 window, and it looks great. It\u2019s seamless.\u201d I will say for certain that\u2019s going to take some getting used to. Other mobile companies have moved toward pinholes and, even in some cases, under-screen cameras. The latter has largely been a mess, dramatically impacting image quality. Something you definitely don\u2019t want on your webcam in the era of the Zoom call. Effectively the inclusion of the notch means additional screen real estate up top where the bezel would otherwise be. Most of the time, it\u2019s nothing a good, dark background can\u2019t mask, or in the case of full-screen video, letter box bars. It can, however, be a nuisance in full-screen mode, particularly in the case of apps with intensive menu systems. The menu bar automatically wraps around the notch. Developers don\u2019t need to anything, it simply moves the menu bar items down so as not to be obscured. This was the case with Audacity, which has yet to even release an Apple silicon version, let alone develop for that brand new notch. The pointer, meanwhile, effectively passes under the notch when you scroll past. If you need more than just a 14-inch display (don\u2019t we all, sometimes?), the Pro chip is capable of supporting two Pro Display XDRs. With the Max, you can run Pro Display XDRs and a 4K TV. The reintroduced HDMI port supports 4K60 and HDR video. Image Credits: Brian Heater The keyboard has been something of a sore spot for the MacBook line over the last several years. Thankfully, the company eventually returned to a mechanism that worked last year, after horror stories of stuck keys and an eventual keyboard replacement program. The current configuration tends toward the softer side of the laptop keyboard spectrum, but it\u2019s light years beyond the rocky missteps of a few years back. Whether the Touch Bar qualifies as a \u201crocky misstep\u201d itself is a question of perspective, but it seems pretty clear that it fell short of Apple\u2019s expectations. Having a super thin touch display over the keys is an interesting idea in theory, but I don\u2019t know many people who regularly interacted with it. It was one of those things you wanted to like, but ultimately never offered up enough reasons to justify its continued existence. Which is to say that I, for one, am not sad to see it go. Image Credits: Brian Heater It\u2019s too early to mourn its death completely, as it continues to hang on to the 13-inch MacBook for dear life, but, well, the future doesn\u2019t look particularly bright for that input device. In its place, the full-height function keys are back, and leave it to Apple to position their return as a great new feature. As the company writes: For the first time, Magic Keyboard brings a full\u2011height function key row to MacBook Pro \u2014 with the tactile feel of mechanical keys that pros love. The keys include brightness, dictation, volume, Spotlight, Siri, Do Not Disrupt and music play back. It also maintains what was always the best part of the Touch Bar: Touch ID. This time it\u2019s a full-size key, rather than the nub that you get on last year\u2019s Air. Image Credits: Brian Heater Much like the return of MagSafe, the abandonment of the Touch Bar is a prime example of why the new MacBooks are the best in years. They build on the technologies and learnings of previous generations introduce some key breakthroughs and, perhaps, most importantly, listened to user feedback. That means moving on from what doesn\u2019t work and doubling down on what does, and above all, not ever assuming you know what\u2019s best for the consumer \u2014 particularly in the case of extremely particular creative pros. Priced between $1,999 and $5,899, this is very much not the MacBook for everyone. For most consumers, the MacBook Air gets the job done \u2014 and then some. But if you\u2019re someone who regularly finds yourself pushing your machine to the limits, the new Pro is a great marriage of the line\u2019s best elements.",

If you need more than just a 14-inch display (don\u2019t we all, sometimes?), the Pro chip is capable of supporting two Pro Display XDRs. With the Max, you can run Pro Display XDRs and a 4K TV. The reintroduced HDMI port supports 4K60 and HDR video. Image Credits: Brian Heater The keyboard has been something of a sore spot for the MacBook line over the last several years. Thankfully, the company eventually returned to a mechanism that worked last year, after horror stories of stuck keys and an eventual keyboard replacement program. The current configuration tends toward the softer side of the laptop keyboard spectrum, but it\u2019s light years beyond the rocky missteps of a few years back. Whether the Touch Bar qualifies as a \u201crocky misstep\u201d itself is a question of perspective, but it seems pretty clear that it fell short of Apple\u2019s expectations. Having a super thin touch display over the keys is an interesting idea in theory, but I don\u2019t know many people who regularly interacted with it. It was one of those things you wanted to like, but ultimately never offered up enough reasons to justify its continued existence. Which is to say that I, for one, am not sad to see it go. Image Credits: Brian Heater It\u2019s too early to mourn its death completely, as it continues to hang on to the 13-inch MacBook for dear life, but, well, the future doesn\u2019t look particularly bright for that input device. In its place, the full-height function keys are back, and leave it to Apple to position their return as a great new feature. As the company writes: For the first time, Magic Keyboard brings a full\u2011height function key row to MacBook Pro \u2014 with the tactile feel of mechanical keys that pros love. The keys include brightness, dictation, volume, Spotlight, Siri, Do Not Disrupt and music play back. It also maintains what was always the best part of the Touch Bar: Touch ID. This time it\u2019s a full-size key, rather than the nub that you get on last year\u2019s Air. Image Credits: Brian Heater Much like the return of MagSafe, the abandonment of the Touch Bar is a prime example of why the new MacBooks are the best in years. They build on the technologies and learnings of previous generations introduce some key breakthroughs and, perhaps, most importantly, listened to user feedback. That means moving on from what doesn\u2019t work and doubling down on what does, and above all, not ever assuming you know what\u2019s best for the consumer \u2014 particularly in the case of extremely particular creative pros. Priced between $1,999 and $5,899, this is very much not the MacBook for everyone. For most consumers, the MacBook Air gets the job done \u2014 and then some. But if you\u2019re someone who regularly finds yourself pushing your machine to the limits, the new Pro is a great marriage of the line\u2019s best elements.",

    "full_description": "Article content Heading into its fourth generation, the Toyota Sienna rushes headlong into a shrinking minivan segment with new styling and an electrified hybrid powertrain. As a nameplate that stretches back the better part of 25 years, Toyota is one of the last vans standing in what was once an elbows-out and crowded marketplace. Article content I\u2019ll get my powertrain complaints out of the way before diving into other aspects of this well-thought out minivan. For 2021, Toyota has elected to plunk a hybrid powertrain into every Sienna it makes, regardless of trim level. Making just 245 horsepower from its combined gasoline and electric guts, it\u2019s just simply underpowered. Hoofing the Sienna to speed up a highway onramp produces a drone like Charlie Brown\u2019s teacher, except she\u2019s yelling at you constantly. The deployment of a continually variable transmission instead of a unit with real gears. Acceleration is surely even more tepid in heavier all-wheel drive variants compared to our front-drive tester.

You may use a different browser or device to view this in full screen. OK Article content But \u2014 and this is key \u2014 the trade-off with this powertrain is its ability to return tremendous fuel efficiency. We saw an indicated 5.3 L/100 km average on an hour\u2019s freeway jaunt while being sensible with the throttle but always maintaining the posted speed limit. Given that performance, keeping this bus in the 6.0 or 6.5 L/100 km bracket on the highway should not be a problem. In the long run, it is far more likely the typical minivan customer cares much more about those types of numbers than outright acceleration. It\u2019s clear Toyota has put an abundance of thought and effort into the new Sienna interior, starting with the so-called \u2018flying bridge\u2019 console which bifurcates the front seating area like those plastic partitions at the checkout counter. It places the gear selector and a couple of cupholders within easy reach, while providing space for a slick wireless phone charger and pass-thru storage area below deck. USB ports appear with the frequency of dandelions on a front lawn and controls for adjusting ventilation \u2014 in all the rows \u2014 couldn\u2019t be simpler. Driver Easy Speak, part of a $5,500 Tech Package, permits the pilot to clearly pipe their voice to the rear speakers in an effort to address Ungrateful Children.

This XSE trim features Super Long Slide seats in this area, able to be shuffled up to 25 inches forward or astern. This opens up limo-like legroom (at the expense of third-row passengers, of course) or the simple capability of placing warring siblings in locations not directly adjacent to each other. This is a bigger deal than non-parents might imagine. An optional rear entertainment screen drops down from the ceiling instead of being mounted on the front seat backs, blocking the view of those cops on your six. Tremendous power-operated sliding side doors have a sensor for hands-free opening when one\u2019s hands are full and \u2014 praise the pharaohs \u2014 a molded icon on the rocker panel to show exactly where one needs to kick so you don\u2019t stand in the parking lot looking like Leo Messi scoring goals. Article content More On This Topic Minivan Comparison: 2021 Chrysler Pacifica vs 2021 Toyota Sienna From an armada of minivans to just 5 contenders Annoyingly, since this is a Toyota, material quality falls off faster than third-period Maple Leafs as one moves into the rear cargo area. Chief amongst complaints from family units who sampled this machine was that the third-row bench doesn\u2019t fold completely flat. Where the Chrysler Pacifica tacos and flips this perch so the hard seat bottom becomes a flat load floor, engineers at Toyota simply elected to sandwich the thing \u2014 as if one were closing a book \u2014 and drop it into a deep well just ahead of the rear bumper. This sounds okay on paper (or even the digital screen you\u2019re reading) but in reality it is a poor solution. Since the seat back and not bottom now serves as the cargo floor, flimsy carpeted flaps are required to hide the now-sunken headrests in an attempt to cover vast crevasses into which various and sundry items will surely fall. As a parent, your author can guarantee that things will get lost down there \u2014 headphones, small toys, gummy bears, you name it. The walls of this area are also encased by hard plastic which is admittedly fine (and easily washable) for kids who are probably going to make a mess anyway but the materials are flimsy and feel cheap for a $53,000 bus.

This is a nicely styled vehicle, and not just in a left-handed \u2018for a van\u2019 type of compliment. The front fascia is said to have been inspired by the Shinkansen Japanese Bullet Train, with headlights wrapping around the sides as if they\u2019re being sculpted by the wind. In fact, there\u2019s plenty of aero sculpting all over the Sienna\u2019s new bodywork, including dips and flares towards the rear. The sliding door tracks neatly disappear into the base of the rear side windows. It\u2019s clear Toyota has placed an abundance of thought into practical aspects of their new Sienna and, save for that folding rear seat, it all functions extremely well. Perhaps more importantly for some, its hybrid powertrain is sure to save money at the pump while the available all-wheel drive permits some comparison with SUVs and crossovers in terms of surefooted winter driving. The minivan market might be shrinking rapidly but the ones which remain \u2014 like the 2021 Sienna \u2014 are exceptionally good at their job.",

Enlarge / Did you really think we were going to be able to get through a cybersecurity article without at least one guy-in-a-ski-mask-with-a-laptop stock photo? Pinopic / Getty Images In part one of our guide to securing your digital life, we\u2019ll talk briefly about that process and about basic measures anyone can take to reduce risks to their devices. In part two, coming in a few days, we\u2019ll address wider digital identity protection measures, along with some special measures for people who may face elevated risks. But if you\u2019re looking for tips about peanut butter sandwich dead drops to anonymously transfer data cards in exchange for cryptocurrency payments... we can\u2019t help you, sorry. You are not Batman A while back, we covered threat modeling \u2014a practice that encompasses some of what is described above. One of the most important aspects of threat modeling is defining your acceptable level of risk. Advertisement We make risk-level assessments all the time, perhaps unconsciously\u2014like judging whether it\u2019s safe to cross the street. To totally remove the threat of being hit by a car, you\u2019d either have to build a tunnel under or a bridge over the street, or you could completely ban cars. Such measures are overkill for a single person crossing the street when traffic is light, but they might be an appropriate risk mitigation when lots of people need to cross a street\u2014or if the street is essentially a pedestrian mall. Enlarge / This guy isn't actually Batman, either, but he's a lot closer to being Batman than we are. (This is cosplayer Auri Aminpour next to his Batmobile. Wicked!) The same goes for modeling the threats in your digital life. Unless you are Batman\u2014with vast reserves of resources, a secret identity to protect from criminals and all but a select few members of law enforcement, and life-or-death consequences if your information gets exposed\u2014you do not need Batman-esque security measures. (There are certainly times when you need additional security even if you\u2019re not Batman, however; we\u2019ll go into those special circumstances in the second half of this guide.) For those who want to lock things down without going offline and moving to a bunker in New Zealand, the first step is to assess the following things: What in my digital life can give away critical information tied to my finances, privacy, and safety? What can I do to minimize those risks? How much risk reduction effort is proportional to the risks I face? How much effort can I actually afford? Reducing your personal attack surface The first question above is all about taking inventory of the bits of your digital life that could be exploited by a criminal (or an unscrupulous company, employer, or the like) for profit at your expense or could put you in a vulnerable position. A sample list might include your phone and other mobile devices, personal computer, home network, social media accounts, online banking and financial accounts, and your physical identification and credit cards. We\u2019re going to cover the first few here; more will be covered in part two. Advertisement Each of these items offers an \u201cattack surface\"\u2014an opportunity for someone to exploit that component to get to your personal data. Just how much of an attack surface you present depends on many factors, but you can significantly reduce opportunities for malicious exploitation of these things with some basic countermeasures. Physical mobile threats Smart phones and tablets carry a significant portion of our digital identities. They also have a habit of falling out of our direct physical control by being lost, stolen, or idly picked up by others while we\u2019re not attending to them. Defending against casual attempts to get at personal data on a smart phone (as opposed to attempts by law enforcement, sophisticated criminals, or state actors) is fairly straightforward. First, if you're not at home, you should always lock your device before you put it down, no exceptions. Your phone should be locked with the most secure method you're comfortable with\u2014as long as it's not a 4-digit PIN, which isn't exactly useless but is definitely adjacent to uselessness. For better security, use a password or a passcode that's at least six characters long\u2014and preferably longer. If you're using facial recognition or a fingerprint unlock on your phone, this shouldn't be too inconvenient. Enlarge / Artist's impression of a person who has hacked a mobile phone. (In reality, phones don't actually say \"HACKED!\" to alert you that you've been hacked. Things would be a lot easier if they did.) D-Keine / Getty Images Second, set your device to require a password immediately after it\u2019s been locked. Delays mean someone who snatches your phone can get to your data if they bring up the screen in time. Additionally, make sure your device is set to erase its contents after 10 bad password attempts at maximum. This is especially important if you haven't set a longer passcode. Also, regularly back up your phone. The safest way to back up data if you\u2019re concerned about privacy is an encrypted backup to your personal computer; however, most iOS device owners can back up their data to iCloud with confidence that it is end-to-end encrypted (as long as they have iOS 13 or later). Your mileage will vary with different Android implementations and backup apps. Along the same lines, make sure you have installed the most recent version of the phone OS available to prevent someone from taking advantage of known security bypasses. For iOS, this is generally simple\u2014when your device prompts you to upgrade, do it . The upgrade situation on Android is somewhat more complicated, but the same general advice holds true: upgrade ASAP, every time. (There is a school of thought that says you should hold off on the latest upgrades in order for bugs to be worked out, but adhering to that advice will put you in a position where your device might have exploitable vulnerabilities. You can mitigate those vulnerabilities by upgrading.)",

    "description": "Apple is finally restoring balance to its portable lineup with the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros. If you wanted a big-screen Mac notebook for video editing over the past year, you were stuck paying a premium for outdated Intel and AMD hardware. So, we've been eagerly awaiting an M1 upgrade for the 16-inch MacBook Pro, a machine I called Apple's best laptop ever when it debuted two years ago.But it's worth remembering that, for all the hype around Apple's M1 chip last year, it was a let down for creative professionals. It just couldn\u2019t handle the kinds of heavy duty video editing and 3D rendering that they demanded, in part due to being capped at 16GB of RAM. That made the 13-inch MacBook Pro a bit of an odd duck, since the Air was nearly as fast.Apple's redesigned MacBook Pros, powered by its new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, are exactly what media professionals have been waiting for. The processors are far faster than last year's M1, they support up to 64GB of RAM, and both laptops feature XDR display technology borrowed from the iPad Pro. But Apple also looked backwards as it stepped forward, restoring ports and adopting a design that resembles many of its older machines. Just call them PowerBooks, reborn.What's newDevindra Hardawar/EngadgetApple isn\u2019t currently planning to replace the 13-inch model with the MacBook Pro 14. It\u2019s more an expansion of the highest-end model. It can do almost everything the 16-inch model can, it\u2019s just smaller. (The only exception is \"High Power Mode,\" which gives the 16-inch M1 Max version a temporary speed boost.) That's one way I've come to terms with the high $1,999 starting price. The bigger model now starts at $2,499, $100 more than the Intel version.Both notebooks still look like MacBook Pros, with sleek unibody aluminum cases. But lean in a bit closer and you'll notice some retro flourishes. They're slightly thicker, with more bulbous edges that hearken back to Apple's notebooks from the 2000's. They're also heavier than you'd expect: the 14-inch model comes in at 3.5 pounds, while the 16-inch varies between 4.7 and 4.8 pounds, depending on the chip you choose. That's about half a pound heavier than the last 16-inch MacBook Pro.\u00a0All of that heft isn\u2019t for naught, though. In part it allowed Apple to cram in a lot more ports. Joining three Thunderbolt 4 USB-C connections are a full-sized HDMI port, a MagSafe power connection, a high-impedance headphone jack and an SD card reader (cue triumphant horns). Sure, you\u2019ll still need adapters to connect older USB Type-A devices, but at least you can offload photos and video without extra gear. You can still charge the notebooks over USB-C \u2014 always useful in a pinch \u2014 but the MagSafe connection is less likely to cause accidental falls and you won't have to use a precious USB-C port just to stay powered up.Devindra Hardawar/EngadgetLooking at the MacBook Pro's screens makes it clear they're anything but retro, though. They feature 14.2-inch and 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR displays, respectively. Mini-LED backlighting lets them reach up to 1,600 nits of peak brightness, which is great for HDR content. The screens are a sharp 254 pixels per inch, with a 3,024 by 1,964 resolution on the 14-inch and 3,456 by 2,234 on the 16-inch. Neither are true 4K (the 16-inch comes close), but you'll still be able to work on 4K and 8K video, just at a reduced scale.Best of all is that the MacBook Pros support ProMotion, Apple's technology that enables refresh rates up to 120Hz. With that flipped on, scrolling through web pages and documents just felt silky smooth. And after spending hours writing up this review, I definitely noticed that my eyes were less fatigued thanks to the speedy refresh rate. This is becoming more common in the laptop world. Microsoft already beat Apple to the punch by putting a 120Hz screen in the Surface Laptop Studio. ProMotion is also intelligent enough to lower the refresh rate when it makes sense, which goes a long way towards saving battery life.Really though, you don't have to think about all of the technology going into Apple's Liquid Retina XDR displays. Just know that they look incredible, with eye-watering brightness in sunny HDR scenes and inky black darkness in night shots. These aren't OLED screens, but mini-LEDs get Apple pretty close to that level of contrast.\u00a0Embracing the notch lifeDevindra Hardawar/EngadgetNow let's talk about the elephant in the room: that notch in the middle of the screen. Much like the last batch of iPhones, Apple carved out a portion of the display to fit in a camera. In this case a 1080p webcam. Upon first glance, it's almost laughable that Apple is leaning even more into a design element that everyone hates. But, honestly, the notch isn't a big deal.Apple wisely pushed the MacOS menu bar around the camera, so it's really just taking up space that would go unused anyway. The menu bar also gets blacked out entirely whenever you put an app or video in fullscreen. You could also use a black wallpaper which effectively hides the notch.I'll happily give up a bit of screen real estate, though, if it means Apple can finally squeeze in a decent camera. And judging from the dozens of video calls I've been on over the past week, it's a huge upgrade. There's a clear leap forward in resolution, sharpness and detail compared to my 2017 MacBook Pro. And it definitely looks better than the M1 MacBook Air, which had a few tweaks, but was still stuck at 720p. It would have been nice to see FaceID on the MacBook Pro though, which would have brought it on-par with Windows Hello-equipped PCs. For now, you'll still have to rely on the TouchID sensor on the power button.In useOur 14-inch review model was equipped with an M1 Pro sporting 16 GPU cores, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. The 16-inch had the 32 GPU core M1 Max, a 2TB SSD and a whopping 64GB of RAM. (This, by the way, marks the first time I've reviewed a laptop with that much RAM.) Both of Apple's new chips also feature 10 CPU cores \u2014 for comparison, the M1 had eight CPU cores and eight GPU cores.Geekbench 5 CPUCinebench R23Disk speed (top reads/writes)Apple MacBook Pro (14-inch)1,767/11,7771,515/12,1185.1 GB/s / 5.8 GB/sApple MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021)1,783/12,6931,524/12,2815.1 GB/s / 6.2 GB/sApple MacBook Pro (Apple M1, 13-inch, 2020)1,696/7,1741,492/7,4673GB/s / 3GB/sDell XPS 15 (Intel i7-11800H, RTX 3050 Ti)1,536/7,5511,506/9,4532.8 GB/s / 2.6 GB/sRazer Blade 14 (AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX. RTX 3080)1,443/7,2261,461/11,5023 GB/s / 2 GB/sJust based on specs, I expected to see some wild performance improvements. And the benchmarks didn't disappoint: According to GeekBench 5, both MacBook Pros blew away every Windows PC we reviewed this year by a significant margin. That includes the NUC 11 Extreme powered by Intel's Core i9-11900KB, a high-end desktop CPU! The single-core performance on the M1 Pro and Max was similar to the M1, which is unsurprising. But the multi-core figures were far higher. Another nice plus: Both of these computers are equipped with very fast NVMe SSDs, which will be a huge help when working with large projects.\u00a0The GPU-heavy Geekbench 5 Compute score made it clear that Apple hasn't completely surpassed the likes of NVIDIA and AMD, though. The 14-inch MacBook Pro was more than twice as fast as the Surface Pro 8 (running Intel's Xe graphics) and the M1-equipped 13-inch MacBook Pro, while the bigger notebook was on-par with the Surface Laptop Studio equipped with an NVIDIA 3050 Ti. These aren't bad scores, but it makes it clear that users who need serious power for 3D rendering or data crunching may be better off with PCs equipped with dedicated GPUs.Devindra Hardawar/EngadgetI don't think those are the people Apple is trying to court, though. Instead, the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros seem like an attempt to get back in the good graces of audio and video producers. Apple's new chips will certainly be more than enough for dealing with media. Both computers managed to convert a 4K video clip to 1080p in 34 seconds with Apple's VideoToolbox hardware encoder, which is four seconds slower than the NUC 11 Extreme, but four seconds faster than the XPS 15. They were also among the fastest Cinebench R23 performers we saw this year \u2014 only the ASUS ROG Strix G15 gaming laptop bested them.And before you ask, no, the M1 Pro and M1 Max don't magically turn these computers into gaming rigs. Sure, everything on Apple Arcade runs smoothly, but that was true of the MacBook Air. When I tried to load Borderlands 3, one of the few semi-recent games that actually works on Macs, I just got an unplayable mess running below 30fps. Maybe the the guarantee of decent GPUs will encourage more game developers to build for Macs, but more likely they'll just end up making sure their iPhone and iPad games run smoothly.Surprisingly, I didn\u2019t notice a huge difference in performance when I was running the MacBook Pros on battery. PCs often slow down dramatically whenever they\u2019re disconnected from a socket, but not so with these notebooks. That\u2019s useful if you need to encode something remotely and you\u2019re willing to sacrifice battery life to get it done.Don\u2019t worry though, the efficiency of the M1 chip\u2019s ARM design leads to great battery performance. The 14-inch MacBook Pro lasted 12 hours and 35 minutes in our benchmark, while the 16-inch went for 16 hours and 34 minutes. That\u2019s over five hours longer than the last Intel model.Devindra Hardawar/EngadgetIt\u2019s clear that Apple listened to many of the complaints from Mac fans (and perhaps even lowly reviewers). But really, that\u2019s something the company has been doing more over the years, like when it finally moved away from those awful butterfly keyboards to more tactile Magic Keyboards. By the way, typing on the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro remains excellent, and the trackpad is a dream to use, as always.Apple didn't skimp on the audio front either. Both MacBook Pros sport a six-speaker array, made up of two tweeters and four force-cancelling woofers. Simply put, they sound miraculous. I normally just play a few songs on notebook speakers to confirm how disappointing they are. But these laptops sounded like I was listening to two small bookshelf speakers, with transparent vocals and punchy bass. Yes, I'm as shocked as you are.The 16-inch MacBook Pro sounds a bit better, since it has room for slightly bigger drivers, but both notebooks are enough for a private jam session. The MacBook Pro's microphones also do a solid job of capturing speech during video calls. I wouldn't use them to record professional music, as Apple suggested you could, but they\u2019re probably fine for a quick podcast session on the road.Wrap-upDevindra Hardawar/EngadgetSo if you\u2019re in the market for one of these new computers, which should you get? If you\u2019re mostly using it for general productivity tasks, then I\u2019d lean towards the 14-inch model, which was just easier to travel with. It\u2019s a good option for coders and people who may not need a ton of screen real estate. But all of the video and audio producers I\u2019ve talked to were unequivocal: they wanted to go big with the 16-inch model.The biggest downside of the new MacBook Pros are their high prices \u2014 but really, what else do you expect from Apple? The 14-inch model, in particular, will probably give you the vapors if you're comparing it to the 13-inch MacBook Pro. But in the world of gaming and high-end productivity notebooks, Apple's pricing isn't that far off. The Razer Blade 14, for example, is just two hundred dollars less than the MacBook Pro 14-inch. Dell's XPS 15 OLED is around $500 cheaper than the cheapest 16-inch MBP, but that's with a CPU that's much slower than Apple's. Once you start speccing that machine up, though, you\u2019ll likely pay close to $2,500.On the whole, these computers have practically everything we\u2019d want in a powerful notebook. If you're a creative professional with a large budget for a new computer, and you want something that'll genuinely speed up your workflow, the new MacBook Pros are exactly what you need.",

    "full_description": "Apple is finally restoring balance to its portable lineup with the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros . If you wanted a big-screen Mac notebook for video editing over the past year, you were stuck paying a premium for outdated Intel and AMD hardware. So, we've been eagerly awaiting an M1 upgrade for the 16-inch MacBook Pro , a machine I called Apple's best laptop ever when it debuted two years ago. Gallery: MacBook Pro 14-inch and 16-inch (2021) | 19 Photos /19 Gallery: MacBook Pro 14-inch and 16-inch (2021) | 19 Photos /19 But it's worth remembering that, for all the hype around Apple's M1 chip last year, it was a let down for creative professionals. It just couldn\u2019t handle the kinds of heavy duty video editing and 3D rendering that they demanded, in part due to being capped at 16GB of RAM. That made the 13-inch MacBook Pro a bit of an odd duck, since the Air was nearly as fast. Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021) 92 SCORE Engadget 92 Critics - Not yet scored N/A Users - Not yet scored N/A Pros Fast M1 Pro and Max processors Excellent Liquid Retina XDR Display Fantastic keyboard Most of the ports you want SD Card reader! Solid battery life Great speakers Cons Pricier than the competition No memory or storage expansion Notch may annoy some Apple's redesigned MacBook Pros, powered by its new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, are exactly what media professionals have been waiting for. The processors are far faster than last year's M1, they support up to 64GB of RAM, and both laptops feature XDR display technology borrowed from the iPad Pro. But Apple also looked backwards as it stepped forward, restoring ports and adopting a design that resembles many of its older machines. Just call them PowerBooks, reborn. What's new Devindra Hardawar/Engadget Apple isn\u2019t currently planning to replace the 13-inch model with the MacBook Pro 14. It\u2019s more an expansion of the highest-end model. It can do almost everything the 16-inch model can, it\u2019s just smaller. (The only exception is \"High Power Mode,\" which gives the 16-inch M1 Max version a temporary speed boost.) That's one way I've come to terms with the high $1,999 starting price. The bigger model now starts at $2,499, $100 more than the Intel version. Both notebooks still look like MacBook Pros, with sleek unibody aluminum cases. But lean in a bit closer and you'll notice some retro flourishes. They're slightly thicker, with more bulbous edges that hearken back to Apple's notebooks from the 2000's. They're also heavier than you'd expect: the 14-inch model comes in at 3.5 pounds, while the 16-inch varies between 4.7 and 4.8 pounds, depending on the chip you choose.

    "full_description": "A week out from the COP26 climate negotiations in Glasgow, all eyes are on two nations: China and the United States. Together, the superpowers are responsible for more than 40% of global carbon emissions. US-China relations have been fractious in recent years, and whether they can cooperate on climate action is crucial to success at COP26 and beyond. US progress on climate change went backwards under the Trump administration, but President Joe Biden has brought the nation back to the table. Biden wants to cooperate with China in this critical policy sphere, raising hopes of a less adversarial bilateral relationship. Throughout 2021, however, US-China relations have become increasingly strained. And China's cooperation at COP26 is far from guaranteed\u2014President Xi Jinping is reportedly unlikely to attend the negotiations. Together, China and the US could supercharge global progress on climate action . But if they fail to cooperate, the two nations risk a race to the bottom on climate change\u2014with dire consequences for all. An emissions snapshot China currently accounts for 28% of global carbon emissions . While its emissions rose rapidly during the 2000s and a good part of 2010s, emissions growth has slowed in recent years thanks to dedicated government efforts to improve energy security and promote renewable energy. China made its first international commitments on climate change at the 2015 Paris climate talks, including a pledge for carbon emissions to peak by around 2030. In 2017, US President Donald Trump pledged to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, giving China the chance to take the global leadership mantle on climate action. It looked like China might assume this role when, last year, it pledged to become carbon-neutral by 2060. China is on track to achieve its 2030 renewable energy and carbon intensity targets. But the target is considered inconsistent with the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5\u2103 this century. In the US, Biden has pledged to reverse the climate policy damage wrought by the Trump presidency. He will pursue ambitious national initiatives and international cooperation, including with China. On again-off again In April this year, Biden sent US Climate Envoy John Kerry to China to discuss collective climate action. During the visit, the two countries released a joint statement declaring a commitment to cooperation. However by September, China's tune had changed. Last month, during Kerry's second visit to China, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi declared cooperation on climate change cannot be divorced from the overall situation of China-US relations. This statement implied China would withhold cooperation on climate change until the US gave ground on broader strategic issues . Examples include the US relaxing its stance on: visa restrictions on Chinese students and members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and their familiessanctions against Chinese leaders, officials and government agenciesits request to extradite Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou from Canada over fraud allegations. But as ever, the relationship is complex. Shortly after Kerry's visit to China, presidents Biden and Xi spoke on the phone covering topics including climate change. Two weeks later, Xi announced China will no longer build new coal-fired power projects abroad. But we cannot deduce from this announcement that China has decided to cooperate with the US on climate. China has been scaling back its financing of coal-fired power stations abroad for years . Fork in the road Cooperation between China and the US will remain highly unpredictable. The key question is whether competition between the two nations on climate action will be constructive or destructive. Under a constructive scenario, the US and China would compete to ramp up their investments in clean energy, advance their technological capabilities and build internationally competitive industries. They would also compete to help emerging countries reduce their emissions. China and the US would both seek to prove the superiority of their respective governance models by making rapid progress on climate change. In other words, does China's party-state, quasi-Communist model offer the most desirable path forward? Or is the US model of democratic capitalism the better option? By contrast, destructive competition between the US and China would have dire consequences for the climate. First, it would make the international flow and diffusion of green technologies difficult. For example, the US controls advanced semiconductor technologies required for electric vehicles (EVs) while China is leading the world in EV battery technologies. If the nations began restricting tech exports to each other, advancement in electric vehicles would significantly slow. It may also become more complex to establish global standards for new major clean energy technologies such as offshore wind systems. Global markets for particular clean energy technologies would become fractured and much smaller than they would otherwise be. With a reduced market size, new climate technologies and products would then take longer to become affordable, slowing their global uptake. Second, an effective system for global climate governance requires most nations, if not all, to participate. Yet, without trust between the US and China, such a system would be untenable. Finally, the domestic climate actions of both the US and China may be adversely affected if tension between the two countries intensifies. In the US, hawkish politicians and media would likely denigrate the administration's position on climate change as its political weakness when dealing with China. The Chinese ruling party would likely face rising nationalist sentiment against further climate actions which would be viewed as caving in to US demands. This nationalist view has long argued that the West presses China on climate actions simply to hold back the country's development. How the US and China act and react on climate issues will continue to be of supreme importance, at COP26 and beyond.

    "full_description": "What is it? A single-player space adventure full of moral choices. Expect to pay: $60/\u00a350 Developer: Eidos Montreal Publisher: Square Enix Reviewed on: Windows 10, GeForce GTX 1070, Intel Core i7-9700 CPU, 16GB RAM Multiplayer? No Release date: October 26 Link: Official site I did not expect to root for Guardians of the Galaxy this much. It was weighed down by so many stagnant vibes during its pre-release cycle. The shadow of Marvel's Avengers, Square Enix's 2020 attempt to transmute the total media superiority of the Marvel Cinematic Universe into a living co-op videogame, loomed particularly large. That game's cast of Hollywood facsimiles\u2014all of these fake Chris Hemsworths\u2014left customers ice cold, and while the core narrative was decent, nobody enjoyed the meaningless currency grind. Guardians comes from the same publisher and appears to be made of the same stock, except that this time, it's a singleplayer-only campaign and the player is restricted to the least interesting member of the troupe, Star-Lord. There is a pervasive focus-tested coldness that corrodes so many products that bear the Marvel name in 2021, and I wasn't optimistic that Eidos Montreal would be capable of overcoming the taint. That is until I solved a puzzle involving a psychedelic space llama who I needed to coax into chewing up some wires on the ship. The beast was either enchanted or repelled by each crewmember's singing voice\u2014he'd come closer to Star-Lord's melody, run away from Rocket Raccoon's, and so on\u2014so we all took turns belting out Bobby McFerrin's \"Don't Worry Be Happy\" until our mercurial llama was finally in place. Guardians is full of sequences that capture the odder, funnier, lighter side of Marvel's cosmic expanse. I ran into a Soviet test-flight golden retriever blessed with celestial hyper-intelligence, and in a moment of weakness, he admitted to me how much he missed his former puny dog-intellect, those endless afternoons chasing tennis balls in the front lawn. There's a fourth-wall-breaking left-hook, taken right out of the Arkham playbook, tying to an amazing twist that caught me hilariously off-guard. Hell, deep into the game's final acts, I watched as the permanently chaffed Rocket Raccoon faced his one lingering trauma thanks to the encouragement and support of his teammates. The scene worked as a better emotional payoff than anything I've seen the character do on film. Guardians of the Galaxy has its heart in the right place\u2026 if only the game itself weren't constantly sabotaging those efforts with exhausting technical jank. Like Avengers before it, Guardians of the Galaxy is steeped deep in the character-action tradition. You take control of Star-Lord, as I mentioned earlier, and unload an endless stream of photon beams at all the toothy beasties, corrupt interplanetary cops, and deranged cult leaders that stand in your way. A bar on the left side of the screen fills up as the player deals damage, punctuated with Marvel-fied versions of those vintage Devil May Cry descriptors\u2014\"Marvelous!\" \"Uncanny!\" The remaining Guardians come into play with your unlockable special power rolodex. I could ask Groot to bind my enemies to the floor with his roots, or summon up Drax for an earth-shattering ground pound. But outside of those instances, your fellow superheroes are relegated to the nameless faces that tend to populate Call of Duty levels, offering the faint image of warfighting solidarity, without actually doing anything all that productive. It gets the job done. The combat isn't where Guardians of the Galaxy shines, but it is both flashy enough and simple enough to sustain some of the more active portions of the plot. I found that the villain-fighting got more engaging the closer I came to the game's conclusion. In the beginning, armed with only a pair of pea-shooters and a handful of basic attacks, Guardians is a shooting gallery with no pulse. But when you're popping off multiple cooldowns at once and enjoying a fully optimized arsenal, the design gets close to that overwhelming, splash-panel, polychromatic eye candy that is so often prioritized in the films. Lasers, bombs, swords, and Drax flying in off the top rope like a punishing Marvel vs Capcom assist. One of the best features in Guardians of the Galaxy is its \"Huddle Up\" function. Every once in a while you can call the team together, offer some words of encouragement, and re-enter the fray with a damage buff cued to a pulpy '80s classic pulled from the game's trove of licensed material. (I heard Gary Numan's \"Cars,\" Wham's \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go,\" Soft Cell's \"Tainted Love.\") It is genuinely incandescent. The story here is centered around the usual universe-threatening Marvel disaster. There's some sort of hyper-religious stellar church corrupting the minds of the Andromeda Galaxy. Our motley crew is here to stop it, even as the odds continue to pile up against us. The Guardians might be a roving batch of greedy malcontents, but at least they've got a heart of gold. The broad-strokes didn't interest me much, but Guardians does a good job integrating the uber-high stakes into the cloistered anxieties of the heroes themselves. One of the cult's first victims? A girl who may or may not be Star-Lord's illegitimate child. How could a bunch of daffy venerated nerds ever seduce a chiseled meathead like Drax? Maybe by introducing the memories of his dead wife and daughter. All of this is buttressed by Guardians' moral choice infrastructure, which is clearly ripped directly from the Telltale convention. Along the way, Star-Lord has a hand in shaping the team's plans and posture, which have a light impact on the narrative. In the interstitial periods between missions, you can chop it up with the team on the ship, akin to those elliptical therapy sessions hosted by Commander Shepard on the Normandy. The writers here are clearly bound by Marvel orthodoxy, but it was still cool to see some of their own flourishes. (Gamora, for instance, is a huge action figure collector in this timeline.) I should reiterate again that Guardians of the Galaxy is very much singleplayer and plot-focused. You move from chapter to chapter, disembarking on all sorts of famous Marvel locales, fighting through beautiful corridors that are occasionally broken up by some heavy-duty cutscenes. That makes the game a bit of a dinosaur, in a good way. A number of the attack unlocks are tied to certain wrinkles in the dramatic arc rather than meeting a certain threshold of resources. You will spend precisely zero minutes staring at talent trees or defensive integers. When I saw that the characters all had their own suite of greyed-out costumes, I thought for sure they were going to be cinched by some sort of depressing meta-grind and an in-game real money store. Nope, you just find those stashed away in the remote corners of the geography as a reward for taking the time to explore. It brings to mind the storytelling conventions of the Uncharted and God of War series. Eidos doesn't punch at quite that weight, but it does enough here to be mentioned alongside those influences. This level of jank is expected in the high-entropy continent of Tamriel, not in a series of combat arenas and connective tissue. That brings me to the core, debilitating issue with Guardians. This game is frequently, flagrantly broken. At one point I ran into three different crashes within a single hour of play. One was a bizarre soft-lock, the other two were straight-up hardcore freezes that required an alt-F4 to escape. The first boss I fought stopped moving a few times; it was stuck in stasis as I blasted away at its tentacles, scoring oodles of cheap damage. The game routinely believed Star-Lord had fallen down a phantom pit, and it dutifully teleported me back to some sort of crucible of danger completely haphazardly. I needed to reload checkpoints in order to get certain progression choke-points to trigger. It's bad, and Square Enix knows it. When I first downloaded my review code for Guardians, it came in at a ridiculous 150GB size. A few days later, the company issued a new version that reduced the file size and promised greater stability. The crashes I described earlier all occurred after that big patch, though. Another patch came after and more will come, but the odds that every physics anomaly and crash will be swept up within days of launch are slim\u2014the post-launch bug fixing phase can go for months and months with big games. This makes Guardians of the Galaxy a difficult game to recommend right now. Something clearly went awry during development, because it's weird for a singleplayer, linear game to have so many bizarre performance issues. This level of jank is expected in the high-entropy continent of Tamriel, not in a series of combat arenas and connective tissue. The closest analogue I can think of is Jedi Fallen Order; another Disney property that shipped with a well-hewn narrative, some neat combat tricks, and a boatload of sundering technical hangups. Unfortunately, I don't think Guardians is quite good enough to offset those problems the way Respawn did. But then I think back to a sequence early on, where Star-Lord runs into an old drinking buddy named Lipless at a slimy dive bar in Knowhere. The two of you fumble through a turgid hair-metal anthem that, apparently, the hero was too blacked-out to remember writing. The player chooses each line in the song, and Star-Lord does his best to half-mumble the lyrics to stay on Lipless' good side. Guardians of the Galaxy desperately wants to be a technicolor, starfaring adventure worthy of the multimedia powerhouse that shares its namesake. It accomplishes that with its story, its voice cast, and its wonderfully cheeky '80s pastiche. If only the technical side could better keep up with those ambitions.",

    "full_description": "Russian-linked hackers blamed for the massive cyberattack on the US last year have been targeting hundreds of companies and organizations in its latest wave of attacks on US-based computer networks \u2014 as the White House dismisses the incident as \u201cunsophisticated, run-of-the mill operations.\u201d In a blog post Sunday , Microsoft said Nobelium \u2013 the Russian-based agency behind last years\u2019 widespread SolarWinds attack \u2013 has been targeting cloud service providers and technology service organizations in a bid to obtain data. The attacks have targeted organizations in the US and Europe since May, Microsoft said. One of Microsoft\u2019s top security officers Tom Burt told the New York Times , which first reported the breach, that the latest attack was \u201cvery large and ongoing.\u201d \u201cNobelium has been attempting to replicate the approach it has used in past attacks by targeting organizations integral to the global IT supply chain. This time, it is attacking a different part of the supply chain: resellers and other technology service providers that customize, deploy and manage cloud services and other technologies on behalf of their customers,\u201d Microsoft said in its blog post. \u201cWe believe Nobelium ultimately hopes to piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers\u2019 IT systems and more easily impersonate an organization\u2019s trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers.\u201d Microsoft said it had notified 609 customers between July 1 and Oct. 19 they had been attacked. The company insisted only a small percent of the latest attempts were successful. \u201cThis recent activity is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling \u2013 now or in the future \u2013 targets of interest to the Russian government,\u201d Microsoft said. \u201cThe attacks we\u2019ve observed in the recent campaign against resellers and service providers have not attempted to exploit any flaw or vulnerability in software but rather used well-known techniques, like password spray and phishing, to steal legitimate credentials and gain privileged access.\u201d Microsoft said it had learned enough about these new attacks to provide information that \u201ccan be used to defend against this new approach.\u201d A Biden administration official told the Times the latest attacks were \u201cunsophisticated, run-of-the mill operations that could have been prevented if the cloud service providers had implemented baseline cybersecurity practices.\u201d \u201cWe can do a lot of things\u2026 but the responsibility to implement simple cybersecurity practices to lock their \u2014 and by extension, our \u2014 digital doors rests with the private sector,\u201d the official said. The US government blamed Russia for the major breach of government agencies last year known as the SolarWinds hack. President Biden hit Russia with sanctions back in April in the wake of the attack.",

    "full_description": "The Facebook Papers project represents a unique collaboration among 17 American news organisations, including The Associated Press. Journalists from a variety of newsrooms, large and small, worked together to gain access to thousands of pages of internal company documents obtained by Frances Haugen, the former Facebook product manager-turned-whistleblower. A separate consortium of European news outlets had access to the same set of documents, and members of both groups began publishing content related to their analysis of the materials at 7 a.m. EDT on Monday, Oct. 25. That date and time was set by the partner news organisations to give everyone in the consortium an opportunity to fully analyse the documents, report out relevant details, and to give Facebook\u2019s public relations staff ample time to respond to questions and inquiries raised by that reporting.

Every member also had the opportunity to attend group briefings to gain information and context about the documents. The launch of The Facebook Papers project follows similar reporting by The Wall Street Journal, sourced from the same documents, as well as Haugen\u2019s appearance on the CBS television show \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and her Oct. 5 Capitol Hill testimony before a U.S. Senate subcommittee. The papers themselves are redacted versions of disclosures that Haugen has made over several months to the Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging Facebook was prioritising profits over safety and hiding its own research from investors and the public. These complaints cover a range of topics, from its efforts to continue growing its audience, to how its platforms might harm children, to its alleged role in inciting political violence. The same redacted versions of those filings are being provided to members of Congress as part of its investigation. And that process continues as Haugen\u2019s legal team goes through the process of redacting the SEC filings by removing the names of Facebook users and lower-level employees and turns them over to Congress. 7 Things: Adrian Weckler on Tech Tech\u2019s stars and turkeys rounded up and served to you every Friday by Ireland\u2019s No. 1 technology writer.

T he discussions reveal staff warnings that the company was making mistakes in how it dealt with the content that its users post on its platform. It also shows concern for the damage it could be doing to its users, its attempts to fix that \u2013 and its fears that younger users are simply not using the site. The documents show that Facebook employees are raising those concerns, and that the issues are leading to large amounts of internal dissent.

They are likely to lead to yet more accusations that Facebook has looked to prioritise the engagement of its users over their safety, by promoting inflammatory or otherwise unhealthy content within its news feed and on its site. Much of the reporting of the documents examines how Facebook responded to threats of violence ahead of the 6 January protests, which would eventually become deadly riots. It shows how technical difficulties meant that it was unable to stop people being recommended civic groups to millions of people, for instance, despite launching a crackdown in an attempt to stop unrest spreading. The files also show how different those standards are across different countries, and how Facebook has struggled to police content in countries that don\u2019t speak English. Many places that are at significant risk of war and other major harms are also not covered by many of Facebook\u2019s more developed protections, such as artificial intelligence tools that can detect hate speech and misinformation, and extra staff to deal with potential problems more quickly, as pointed out by The Verge. 7 Things: Adrian Weckler on Tech Tech\u2019s stars and turkeys rounded up and served to you every Friday by Ireland\u2019s No. 1 technology writer.

The files, which detail internal conversations on Facebook\u2019s message boards, are just the latest difficult leak for Facebook, which has seen a host of information released to the public in recent weeks. Some of the documents were the basis of those reports, in the Wall Street Journal, which revealed among other things that Facebook seemed to be aware that Instagram was toxic for young girls. The existence of the new set of documents had been pre-emptively attacked by Facebook, which said that a \u201ccurated selection out of millions of documents at Facebook can in no way be used to draw fair conclusions about us\u201d. The files had been made available to some 30 different US news organisations before they were published on Monday, and Facebook had attempted to discredit them before they were published.

    "full_description": "Prologis, the San Francisco-based company, has bought out Countryside Properties, its London-listed joint venture partner, to take complete control of the second phase of expansion at the warehouse space at Cambridge Biomedical Campus. The life sciences hub which lies on the outskirts of Cambridge will remain as the largest centre of medical research in Europe. It is also home to AstraZeneca , GlaxoSmithKline, and Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital. Prologis plan to build an extra 400,000 sq ft of office and laboratory space. The first project will see the construction of 100,000 sq ft, five-storey space costing \u00a365million. Construction is scheduled to begin next spring and finish in the summer of 2023. The facility will be designed so that small businesses, which are becoming an increasingly more important feature of the life sciences sector in the UK, have ready-made labs to work from. The building is being developed \u201cspeculatively\u201d, which means that is yet to have any tenants line-up to use the space. Companies will no doubt be lining up to apply for the space, tipped to soon be in hot demand. Prologis\u2019s chief executive and chairman, Hamid Moghadam, said: \u201cA lot of innovation was [historically] done by Big Pharma companies, but now a lot of the scientists that are hanging around the major universities are taking advantage of venture capital that has become available. \u201cAll of a sudden it is changing from a big company activity to a very entrepreneurial activity and innovation happens much faster in smaller settings.\u201d Andrew Blevins, UK head of life sciences for Prologis, said the space is \u201cgoing to be pitching to that much more granular business community, such as start-ups. It\u2019s not just the domain of the Super Pharmas anymore.\u201d Britain\u2019s life sciences industry currently employs more than 250,000 people and is valued to be an industry worth \u00a38 \u200bbillion a year. READ MORE: State of emergency on EU's doorstep as Russia's gas runs dry This has been helped by an increased awareness of healthcare as well an improvement to the reliability of income from tenants. Lab technicians usually require a space to work outside of their homes and so this is an important development for the sector. This also helps to explain why life science is one of the most booming property sectors. A \u201cgolden triangle\u201d of spaces for innovative lab technicians now exists between Cambridge, London and Oxford, which pulls talent from its world-class universities. Blackstone, the American investment group, is also investing \u00a38550million in building 800,000 sq ft for office and laboratory space, also in Cambridge.

George, Charlotte and Louis spotted at Heathrow airport [REPORT] Brookfield also bought several life sciences sites in the golden triangle for \u00a37144mllion over the summer. Prologis has committed to building another \u00a31.5billion of warehouse space in Britain over the next three years on top of this \u00a3450million project. The group, which lists Amazon as one of their tenants, expects that the new warehouses will support about 14,000 jobs. This also comes after the Government announced its UK Life Sciences Vision, which set a 10-year strategy for the sector to solve some of the biggest healthcare problems of our generation, like cancer and dementia. Part of the plan included the setting up of the Life Sciences Investment Programme, which brings total amount of funding available to UK\u2019s most promising life sciences companies to \u00a31 billion",

    "content": "One of the big leaders in buying up and scaling third-party merchants selling on Amazon and other marketplace platforms is announcing a major round of funding today as it continues to expand its ambitions. Thrasio, the Boston-based startup, has closed an all-equity Series D of over $1 billion \u2014 a huge infusion in cash that it will be using to continue buying up more companies as well as to expand internationally. It said that it\u2019s currently on a rate of buying 1.5 businesses per week and now has some 200 brands in its portfolio. Silver Lake and Advent International led the round, with Advent remaining the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Upper90, funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P., PEAK6 Investments and Corner Capital \u2014 all previous backers \u2014 were also in the round. Thrasio has confirmed to me that the valuation is between $5 billion and $10 billion but declined to get more specific. As a marker of where it was prior to this round, in April of this year, when it raised $100 million, Thrasio was valued at $3.7 billion. Just on a straight added-capital basis that would put its valuation at close to $5 billion but the company also notes that it has been seeing accelerated growth \u2014 the number of brands under its wing has doubled since then to 200 \u2014 so very likely some ways higher than that. Current brands include Angry Orange pet deodorizers and stain removers, SafeRest mattress protectors and ThisWorx car cleaning and detailing products. The company, founded in 2018, has now raised $3.4 billion, including a $650 million debt round earlier this year. Thrasio is one of the pioneers of the modern \u201croll up\u201d player, and its traction, along with the wider opportunity in the market, have spawned dozens of other startups around the world building businesses replicating its model that have collectively raised hundreds of millions of dollars in equity and debt to build out their businesses. Other recent fundings in the space have included Heroes, which raised $200 million in August; Olsam ($165 million); Suma Brands ($150 million); Elevate Brands ($250 million); Perch ($775 million); factory14 ($200 million); as well as Heyday, The Razor Group, Branded, SellerX, Berlin Brands Group (X2), Benitago, Latin America\u2019s Valoreo and Rainforest and Una Brands out of Asia. One of the reasons it has raised so much in this round is to better target that global opportunity. Thrasio already has operations in the UK, Germany China and Japan and the plan is to expand that further, both as a means of finding more companies to gobble up, but also to expand its wider supply chain. That wider opportunity, meanwhile, remains a large one despite how crowded the market is getting. By various estimates there are between 5 million and 10 million third-party merchants selling on Amazon alone, leveraging the e-commerce giant\u2019s giant audience of shoppers and its Fulfillment by Amazon platform for delivery and other distribution logistics to cut down the operational costs and inefficiencies of building a direct-to-consumer business from the ground up. Thrasio\u2019s co-CEO and co-founder Josh Silberstein told me earlier this year that Thrasio estimates that there are around 50,000 businesses out of those that make more than $1 million in revenues annually, so the tail of what is out there in terms of size is very long. Thrasio is building out a bigger economy of scale play around that basic model, and in some cases replacing some of the Amazon components with scale of its own, which \u2014 the theory goes \u2014 only improves as it grows. That includes sourcing for products (as well as wider supply chain challenges), analytics both to source the more interesting companies to buy up as well as to market those products once under the Thrasio wing, even its own fulfillment technology. It is also increasingly also looking at opportunities to build sales and customer relationships outside of the Amazon ecosystem, using other marketplaces, other sales channels and in some cases direct-to-consumer plays. (And that analytics engine for sourcing potential acquisitions is working hard: Thrasio says that it has \u201cevaluated\u201d some 6,000 businesses overall.) \u201cOur business is getting better as it gets bigger, and these investments will be invaluable as we continue on that path,\u201d said Carlos Cashman, the other co-founder and CEO of Thrasio, in a statement. \u201cAdvent and Silver Lake both have phenomenal track records of building successful global businesses, and the additional funds from existing investors including Upper90 and PEAK6 are extremely rewarding votes of confidence in a crowded space.\u201d \u201cThrasio created the Amazon aggregator category, and their innovative approach and impressive growth have brought a lot of attention to this space,\u201d said Greg Mondre, co-CEO, and Stephen Evans, managing director, of Silver Lake, in a joint statement. \u201cWe believe Carlos Cashman and his team are well positioned to accelerate their growth and build the preeminent next-generation, technology-driven consumer goods company.

    "pubDate": "2021-10-25 12:33:00",
    "full_description": "Facebook the company is losing control of Facebook the product not to mention the last shreds of its carefully crafted, decade-old image as a benevolent company just wanting to connect the world. Thousands of pages of internal documents provided to Congress by a former employee depict an internally conflicted company where data on the harms it causes is abundant, but solutions, much less the will to act on them, are halting at best. The crisis exposed by the documents shows how Facebook, despite its regularly avowed good intentions, appears to have slow-walked or sidelined efforts to address real harms the social network has magnified and sometimes created. They reveal numerous instances where researchers and rank-and-file workers uncovered deep-seated problems that the company then overlooked or ignored. Final responsibility for this state of affairs rests with CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who holds what one former employee described as dictatorial power over a corporation that collects data on and provides free services to roughly 3 billion people around the world. Ultimately, it rests with Mark and whatever his prerogative is and it has always been to grow, to increase his power and his reach,\" said Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University communications professor who's followed Facebook closely for years. Zuckerberg has an ironclad hold on Facebook Inc. He holds the majority of the company's voting shares, controls its board of directors and has increasingly surrounded himself with executives who don't appear to question his vision. But he has so far been unable to address stagnating user growth and shrinking engagement for Facebook the product in key areas such as the United States and Europe. Worse, the company is losing the attention of its most important demographic teenagers and young people with no clear path to gaining it back, its own documents reveal. Young adults engage with Facebook far less than their older cohorts, seeing it as an outdated network\" with irrelevant content\" that provides limited value for them, according to a November 2020 internal document. It is boring, misleading and negative,\" they say. In other words, the young see Facebook as a place for old people. Facebook's user base has been aging faster, on average, than the general population, the company's researchers found. Unless Facebook can find a way to turn this around, its population will continue to get older and young people will find even fewer reasons to sign on, threatening the monthly user figures that are essential to selling ads. Facebook says its products are still widely used by teens, although it acknowledges there's tough competition\" from TikTok, Snapchat and the like. So it can continue to expand its reach and power, Facebook has pushed for high user growth outside the U.S. and Western Europe. But as it expanded into less familiar parts of the world, the company systematically failed to address or even anticipate the unintended consequences of signing up millions of new users without also providing staff and systems to identify and limit the spread of hate speech, misinformation and calls to violence. In Afghanistan and Myanmar, for instance, extremist language has flourished due to a systemic lack of language support for content moderation, whether that's human or artificial intelligence-driven. In Myanmar, it has been linked to atrocities committed against the country's minority Rohingya Muslim population. But Facebook appears unable to acknowledge, much less prevent, the real-world collateral damage accompanying its untrammeled growth. Those harms include shadowy algorithms that radicalize users, pervasive misinformation and extremism, facilitation of human trafficking, teen suicide and more. Internal efforts to mitigate such problems have often been pushed aside or abandoned when solutions conflict with growth and, by extension, profit. Backed into a corner with hard evidence from leaked documents, the company has doubled down defending its choices rather than try to fix its problems. We do not and we have not prioritized engagement over safety,\" Monika Bickert, Facebook's head of global policy management, told The Associated Press this month following congressional testimony from whistleblower and former Facebook employee Frances Haugen. In the days since Haugen's testimony and appearance on 60 Minutes\" during which Zuckerberg posted a video of himself sailing with his wife Priscilla Chan Facebook has tried to discredit Haugen by repeatedly pointing out that she didn't directly work on many of the problems she revealed. A curated selection out of millions of documents at Facebook can in no way be used to draw fair conclusions about us,\" Facebook tweeted from its public relations newsroom account earlier this month, following the company's discovery that a group of news organizations was working on stories about the internal documents. At the heart of these stories is a premise which is false. Yes, we're a business and we make profit, but the idea that we do so at the expense of people's safety or wellbeing misunderstands where our own commercial interests lie,\" Facebook said in a prepared statement Friday. The truth is we've invested $13 billion and have over 40,000 people to do one job: keep people safe on Facebook. Statements like these are the latest sign that Facebook has gotten into what Sophie Zhang, a former Facebook data scientist, described as a siege mentality at the company. Zhang last year accused the social network of ignoring fake accounts used to undermine foreign elections. With more whistleblowers notably Haugen coming forward, it's only gotten worse. Facebook has been going through a bit of an authoritarian narrative spiral, where it becomes less responsive to employee criticism, to internal dissent and in some cases cracks down upon it,\" said Zhang, who was fired from Facebook in the fall of 2020. And this leads to more internal dissent.\" I have seen many colleagues that are extremely frustrated and angry, while at the same time, feeling powerless and (disheartened) about the current situation,\" one employee, whose name was redacted, wrote on an internal message board after Facebook decided last year to leave up incendiary posts by former President Donald Trump that suggested Minneapolis protesters could be shot. My view is, if you want to fix Facebook, do it within. This story is based in part on disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by Haugen's legal counsel. The redacted versions received by Congress were obtained by a consortium of news organizations, including The Associated Press. They detail painstakingly collected data on problems as wide-ranging as the trafficking of domestic workers in the Middle East, an over-correction in crackdowns on Arabic content that critics say muzzles free speech while hate speech and abuse flourish, and rampant anti-vaccine misinformation that researchers found could have been easily tamped down with subtle changes in how users view posts on their feed. The company insists it does not conduct research and then systematically and willfully ignore it if the findings are inconvenient for the company.\" This claim, Facebook said in a statement, can only be made by cherry-picking selective quotes from individual pieces of leaked material in a way that presents complex and nuanced issues as if there is only ever one right answer.\" At this stage, that seems unlikely. There is a deep-seated conflict between profit and people within Facebook and the company does not appear to be ready to give up on its narrative that it's good for the world even as it regularly makes decisions intended to maximize growth. Facebook did regular surveys of its employees what percentage of employees believe that Facebook is making the world a better place, Zhang recalled. It was around 70 percent when I joined. It was around 50 percent when I left, said Zhang, who was at the company for more than two years before she was fired in the fall of 2020. Facebook has not said where the number stands today.

    "full_description": "The Facebook Papers project represents a unique collaboration among 17 American news organizations, including The Associated Press. Journalists from a variety of newsrooms, large and small, worked together to gain access to thousands of pages of internal company documents obtained by Frances Haugen, the former Facebook product manager-turned-whistleblower. A separate consortium of European news outlets had access to the same set of documents, and members of both groups began publishing content related to their analysis of the materials at 7 a.m. EDT on Monday, Oct. 25. That date and time was set by the partner news organizations to give everyone in the consortium an opportunity to fully analyze the documents, report out relevant details, and to give Facebook's public relations staff ample time to respond to questions and inquiries raised by that reporting. Each member of the consortium pursued its own independent reporting on the document contents and their significance. Every member also had the opportunity to attend group briefings to gain information and context about the documents. The launch of The Facebook Papers project follows similar reporting by The Wall Street Journal, sourced from the same documents, as well as Haugen's appearance on the CBS television show 60 Minutes and her Oct. 5 Capitol Hill testimony before a U.S. Senate subcommittee. The papers themselves are redacted versions of disclosures that Haugen has made over several months to the Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging Facebook was prioritizing profits over safety and hiding its own research from investors and the public. These complaints cover a range of topics, from its efforts to continue growing its audience, to how its platforms might harm children, to its alleged role in inciting political violence. The same redacted versions of those filings are being provided to members of Congress as part of its investigation. And that process continues as Haugen's legal team goes through the process of redacting the SEC filings by removing the names of Facebook users and lower-level employees and turns them over to Congress. The Facebook Papers consortium will continue to report on these documents as more become available in the coming days and weeks. AP regularly teams up with other news organizations to bring important journalism to the world, said Julie Pace, senior vice president and executive editor. The Facebook Papers project is in keeping with that mission. In all collaborations, AP maintains its editorial independence.",

While it\u2019s a whole new chapter with the new Windows OS, taking screenshots on Windows 11 is almost as traditional as the previous OS. If you need to capture a screenshot of something important on your PC, here are a bunch of methods that can simplify the process. How to take a screenshot on PC in simple steps With PrtScn key The most easiest way to take a screenshot on the computer screen is by pressing the \u201cPrint Screen\u201d key on your keyboard that you will find labeled as \u201cPrtSc\u201d in the top row near the Function keys. The option lets you copy the entire screen to the clipboard. You can then paste the screenshot into a program that displays images (Paint or MS Word) by entering Ctrl+V. Windows Key + PrtScr If you want to capture a screenshot of your entire screen, save it as a file then you can follow this method. On hitting the keys entire desktop will darken for a second to show that the screenshot has been captured and a new PNG file will be saved to the Pictures/Screenshots folder. Snipping tool This is a utility tool in Windows 10 that you can use to take a screenshot and save it as an image file without being required to first paste it into another program. to do so just open the Snipping Tool from the Start menu and in the \u2018Mode\u2019 drop down choose the shape you want for your snap. After that click on the New option and it will freeze the screen. By using the mouse you can create the screenshot which will then appear in the Snipping Tool window. Once you are done click \u2018File\u2019 and then click \u2018Save As\u2019 to save the screenshot to your desktop. Game Bar You can also use the Game bar to snap a screenshot by hitting the Windows key + G key. This method is useful if you are in the middle of the game and want to take a snap of that killer shot or record a video. You can set your own Game bar screenshot keyboard shortcut by heading to Settings > Gaming > Game bar. The post How to take a screenshot on PC in simple steps appeared first on BGR India.",

    "full_description": "The Russian-based agency behind last year's massive SolarWinds cyberattack has targeted hundreds more companies and organizations in its latest wave of attacks on US-based computer systems, Microsoft said in a blog post. Microsoft , in a blog post dated October 24, said Nobelium's latest wave targeted \"resellers and other technology service providers\" of cloud services. Those attacks were part of a broader campaign over the summer, Microsoft said, adding it had notified 609 customers between July 1 and October 19 that they had been attacked. Just a small percent of the latest attempts were successful, Microsoft told the New York Times , which first reported the breach, but it gave no further details. US cybersecurity officials could not be immediately reached to confirm the report. US officials confirmed to the Times that the operation was underway, with one unnamed senior administration official calling it \"unsophisticated, run-of-the mill operations that could have been prevented if the cloud service providers had implemented baseline cybersecurity practices.\" \"This recent activity is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling \u2013 now or in the future \u2013 targets of interest to the Russian government,\" Microsoft wrote. \u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2021 .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

    "full_description": "Geneva \u2014 Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere reached new record levels last year, the United Nations said on Monday in a stark warning ahead of the COP26 summit about worsening global warming . The Greenhouse Gas Bulletin from the UN's World Meteorological Organization said the annual rate of increase last year was above the yearly average between 2011 and 2020 \u2014 and the trend continued in 2021. The WMO said the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a temporary decline in new emissions, but had no discernible impact on the atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases and their growth rates. How climate change is hurting your health The organization said that as long as emissions continue, global temperatures will continue to rise. And given the long life of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, the temperature level already observed will persist for several decades even if emissions are rapidly reduced to net zero. White House wants climate action before COP26... 06:42 COP26, the UN Climate Change Conference, is being held in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12. \"The Greenhouse Gas Bulletin contains a stark, scientific message for climate change negotiators at COP26,\" said WMO chief Petteri Taalas. \"At the current rate of increase in greenhouse gas concentrations , we will see a temperature increase by the end of this century far in excess of the Paris Agreement targets of 1.5 to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. \"We are way off track.\" The greenhouse gases The three major greenhouses gases are CO2, methane and nitrous oxide. CO2 is the most important, accounting for around 66% of the warming effect on the climate. U.S. intel chiefs warn climate change will \"exacerbate risks\" U.N.'s warning on climate change 09:36 CO2 concentrations reached 413.2 parts per million in 2020, up 2.5 ppm, and is at 149% of the 1750 pre-industrial level, the WMO said. The report said that roughly half of the CO2 emitted by human activity remains in the atmosphere, with the other half ending up in the oceans and the land. \"The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3C warmer and sea level was 10-20 meters [yards] higher than now. But there weren't 7.8 billion people then,\" said Taalas. Methane averages reached a new high of 1,889 parts per billion in 2020, up 11ppb on the year before, and is at 262% of the pre-industrial benchmark. Study looks at cattle methane emissions 05:16 Around 40% of methane is emitted from natural sources such as wetlands, while 60% comes from human activity, including rice agriculture and landfills. Nitrous oxide averages reached 333.2 ppb, up 1.2 ppb, at 123 percent of 1750 levels. Need to \"revisit\" our \"whole way of life\" The WMO said that with continued rising greenhouse gas emissions, alongside rising temperatures, the planet could also expect more weather extremes. That includes intense heat and rainfall, ice melt, sea-level rise and ocean acidification \u2014 all of which will have far-reaching socio-economic impacts. Climate deal faces challenges over spending 06:43 \"We need to transform our commitment into action that will have an impact on the gases that drive climate change,\" said Taalas. \"We need to revisit our industrial, energy and transport systems and whole way of life. The needed changes are economically affordable and technically possible. There is no time to lose.\" Euan Nisbet, from the University of London's Greenhouse Gas Group, compared greenhouse gas measurements to \"skidding into a car crash.\" \"The disaster gets closer and closer but you can't stop it. You can clearly see the crash ahead, and all you can do is howl.\" Dave Reay, director of the Edinburgh Climate Change Institute, said the report provided a \"brutally frank\" assessment of COP achievements so far: \"an epic fail.\" Climate Change More World leaders prepare for UN climate summit Here's how climate change is hurting your health Intel community says climate change effects will \"exacerbate risks\" to national security La Ni\u00f1a expected to bring warmer-than-average winter to parts of U.S. World is set to extract twice as much fossil fuel as climate allows More Download our Free App For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app iOS Android Fire TV Apple TV Roku All Smart TV Apps",

    "content": "<article> <p>We may have finally seen what the new VR headset that will replace the Oculus Quest 2 looks like. Convincing-looking leaked tutorial videos are showing off an all-new Oculus headset design for the Oculus Quest 2 Pro or <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/oculus-quest-3-price-release-date-specs\">Oculus Quest 3</a> we\u2019ve been waiting for - and it might be at Facebook Connect in just a few days.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/basti564/status/1452366495053488135\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Twitter thread</u></a> shows off multiple clips that claim to be instructional videos found in the \u201cSeacliff firmware\u201d - with Seacliff being the codename of a supposed new Oculus VR headset. </p><p>In the videos, we see a new VR headset that seems to be wireless like the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/oculus-quest-2-review\">Oculus Quest 2</a> but has a much less bulky front visor, with the weight instead distributed across the front and with a pack at the back.</p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/best-horror-vr-games\">Best Horror VR Games</a> you can play right now</li><li>Check out the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/the-best-vr-games\">best VR Games of 2021</a></li><li>Looking to upgrade your VR setup? Here are the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/the-best-vr-headset\">best VR headsets of 2021</a></li></ul> <p>The biggest change of all though looks to be the design of the controllers. The new controllers (which are shown to be charged up via a dock alongside the new headset) also lack the Quest 2\u2019s tracking rings. </p><p>This likely means that the controllers are able to manage their own inside-out tracking rather than relying on the headset. However it\u2019s not 100% clear from what\u2019s shown if this is the case. </p><p>We have to remember to take these videos with a pinch of salt though, as there\u2019s no guarantee that these are legitimate. However if they are the real deal they suggest that the next Oculus Quest headset could be nearly completed and that makes it a shoe-in to appear later this week at Facebook Connect.</p> <div class=\"see-more see-more--clipped\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet hawk-ignore\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Quest Pro / Seacliff [thread]found by Samulia in the Seacliff firmware pic.twitter.com/0pGODx2HCp<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Basti564/status/1452366495053488135\">October 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class=\"see-more__filter display-see-more\"></div><div class=\"see-more__button-container display-see-more\"><span class=\"see-more__button\">See more</span></div></div> <hr> <h2 id=\"analysis-the-oculus-quest-2-pro-or-oculus-quest-3-xa0-5\">Analysis: The Oculus Quest 2 Pro or Oculus Quest 3? </h2> <p>Back in April, it was suggested that we\u2019d be getting the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/oculus-quest-pro-will-arrive-long-before-any-oculus-quest-3-vr-headset\">Oculus Quest 2 Pro before the next proper upgrade to the Oculus Quest line of headsets</a> - the Oculus Quest 3 - but now we\u2019re less certain of that based on what we\u2019ve seen.</p><p>The device shown off in the instructional videos looks like more than just an incremental upgrade.

    "full_description": "We may have finally seen what the new VR headset that will replace the Oculus Quest 2 looks like. Convincing-looking leaked tutorial videos are showing off an all-new Oculus headset design for the Oculus Quest 2 Pro or Oculus Quest 3 we\u2019ve been waiting for - and it might be at Facebook Connect in just a few days. A Twitter thread shows off multiple clips that claim to be instructional videos found in the \u201cSeacliff firmware\u201d - with Seacliff being the codename of a supposed new Oculus VR headset. In the videos, we see a new VR headset that seems to be wireless like the Oculus Quest 2 but has a much less bulky front visor, with the weight instead distributed across the front and with a pack at the back. The biggest change of all though looks to be the design of the controllers. The new controllers (which are shown to be charged up via a dock alongside the new headset) also lack the Quest 2\u2019s tracking rings. This likely means that the controllers are able to manage their own inside-out tracking rather than relying on the headset. However it\u2019s not 100% clear from what\u2019s shown if this is the case. We have to remember to take these videos with a pinch of salt though, as there\u2019s no guarantee that these are legitimate. However if they are the real deal they suggest that the next Oculus Quest headset could be nearly completed and that makes it a shoe-in to appear later this week at Facebook Connect. Quest Pro / Seacliff [thread]found by Samulia in the Seacliff firmware pic.twitter.com/0pGODx2HCp October 24, 2021 Back in April, it was suggested that we\u2019d be getting the Oculus Quest 2 Pro before the next proper upgrade to the Oculus Quest line of headsets - the Oculus Quest 3 - but now we\u2019re less certain of that based on what we\u2019ve seen. The device shown off in the instructional videos looks like more than just an incremental upgrade. We can\u2019t tell what the internals are from the video, but if Oculus is going to create a headset and controllers that look vastly different to what\u2019s come before it would be smart to make this headset a more meaningful upgrade than just an \u2018Oculus Quest 2 Pro\u2019. Case in point, look at what Sony did with the PS4 Pro vs the PS5 . The Pro looks nearly identical to the PS4 - albeit turning the double-stacked console into a triple stack to highlight the power boost. Meanwhile, the PS5 looks nothing like its predecessor telling players that this isn\u2019t just a minor upgrade but a full-blown next-gen machine. Based on what we\u2019ve seen the new Oculus Quest headset would be more than capable of supporting beefier components to amp up its internal power. With what looks to be better heat and weight distribution it could very easily be equipped with more powerful processors, more RAM and displays with higher definition than what the Oculus Quest 2 currently uses. Oculus will want to be careful with how much extra juice it pumps in for now. The Oculus Quest 2 has sold so well because it\u2019s a very affordable entry into VR - this all-new headset might forget that and blow past many more casual users\u2019 budgets. For now, we\u2019ll have to wait for Facebook Connect on Thursday to know for sure what Facebook and Oculus have in store for us. Based on what we\u2019ve seen though, the day can\u2019t come soon enough.",

    "full_description": "Facebook employees have warned for years that as the company raced to become a global service it was failing to police abusive content in countries where such speech was likely to cause the most harm, according to interviews with five former employees and internal company documents viewed by Reuters. For over a decade, Facebook has pushed to become the world\u2019s dominant online platform. It currently operates in more than 190 countries and boasts more than 2.8 billion monthly users who post content in more than 160 languages. But its efforts to prevent its products from becoming conduits for hate speech, inflammatory rhetoric and misinformation \u2013 some which has been blamed for inciting violence \u2013 have not kept pace with its global expansion. Read more: Explainer: What are the Facebook Papers? Internal company documents viewed by Reuters show Facebook has known that it hasn\u2019t hired enough workers who possess both the language skills and knowledge of local events needed to identify objectionable posts from users in a number of developing countries. The documents also showed that the artificial intelligence systems Facebook employs to root out such content frequently aren\u2019t up to the task, either; and that the company hasn\u2019t made it easy for its global users themselves to flag posts that violate the site\u2019s rules. Story continues below advertisement Those shortcomings, employees warned in the documents, could limit the company\u2019s ability to make good on its promise to block hate speech and other rule-breaking posts in places from Afghanistan to Yemen. In a review posted to Facebook\u2019s internal message board last year regarding ways the company identifies abuses on its site, one employee reported \u201csignificant gaps\u201d in certain countries at risk of real-world violence, especially Myanmar and Ethiopia. The documents are among a cache of disclosures made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager who left the company in May. Reuters was among a group of news organizations able to view the documents, which include presentations, reports and posts shared on the company\u2019s internal message board. Their existence was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. 4:28 Implications for Facebook after Congressional hearing Implications for Facebook after Congressional hearing \u2013 Oct 6, 2021 Facebook spokesperson Mavis Jones said in a statement that the company has native speakers worldwide reviewing content in more than 70 languages, as well as experts in humanitarian and human rights issues. She said these teams are working to stop abuse on Facebook\u2019s platform in places where there is a heightened risk of conflict and violence. Story continues below advertisement \u201cWe know these challenges are real and we are proud of the work we\u2019ve done to date,\u201d Jones said. Still, the cache of internal Facebook documents offers detailed snapshots of how employees in recent years have sounded alarms about problems with the company\u2019s tools \u2013 both human and technological \u2013 aimed at rooting out or blocking speech that violated its own standards. The material expands upon Reuters\u2019 previous reporting on Myanmar and other countries, where the world\u2019s largest social network has failed repeatedly to protect users from problems on its own platform and has struggled to monitor content across languages. Among the weaknesses cited were a lack of screening algorithms for languages used in some of the countries Facebook has deemed most \u201cat-risk\u201d for potential real-world harm and violence stemming from abuses on its site. The company designates countries \u201cat-risk\u201d based on variables including unrest, ethnic violence, the number of users and existing laws, two former staffers told Reuters. The system aims to steer resources to places where abuses on its site could have the most severe impact, the people said.

Story continues below advertisement In 2018, United Nations experts investigating a brutal campaign of killings and expulsions against Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya Muslim minority said Facebook was widely used to spread hate speech toward them. That prompted the company to increase its staffing in vulnerable countries, a former employee told Reuters. Facebook has said it should have done more to prevent the platform being used to incite offline violence in the country. Ashraf Zeitoon, Facebook\u2019s former head of policy for the Middle East and North Africa, who left in 2017, said the company\u2019s approach to global growth has been \u201ccolonial,\u201d focused on monetization without safety measures. More than 90 per cent of Facebook\u2019s monthly active users are outside the United States or Canada. LANGUAGE ISSUES Facebook has long touted the importance of its artificial-intelligence (AI) systems, in combination with human review, as a way of tackling objectionable and dangerous content on its platforms. Machine-learning systems can detect such content with varying levels of accuracy. Story continues below advertisement But languages spoken outside the United States, Canada and Europe have been a stumbling block for Facebook\u2019s automated content moderation, the documents provided to the government by Haugen show. The company lacks AI systems to detect abusive posts in a number of languages used on its platform. In 2020, for example, the company did not have screening algorithms known as \u201cclassifiers\u201d to find misinformation in Burmese, the language of Myanmar, or hate speech in the Ethiopian languages of Oromo or Amharic, a document showed. These gaps can allow abusive posts to proliferate in the countries where Facebook itself has determined the risk of real-world harm is high. 1:41 Zuckerberg hits back at claims by Facebook whistleblower Zuckerberg hits back at claims by Facebook whistleblower \u2013 Oct 6, 2021 Reuters this month found posts in Amharic, one of Ethiopia\u2019s most common languages, referring to different ethnic groups as the enemy and issuing them death threats. A nearly year-long conflict in the country between the Ethiopian government and rebel forces in the Tigray region has killed thousands of people and displaced more than 2 million. Story continues below advertisement Facebook spokesperson Jones said the company now has proactive detection technology to detect hate speech in Oromo and Amharic and has hired more people with \u201clanguage, country and topic expertise,\u201d including people who have worked in Myanmar and Ethiopia. In an undated document, which a person familiar with the disclosures said was from 2021, Facebook employees also shared examples of \u201cfear-mongering, anti-Muslim narratives\u201d spread on the site in India, including calls to oust the large minority Muslim population there. \u201cOur lack of Hindi and Bengali classifiers means much of this content is never flagged or actioned,\u201d the document said. Internal posts and comments by employees this year also noted the lack of classifiers in the Urdu and Pashto languages to screen problematic content posted by users in Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. Jones said Facebook added hate speech classifiers for Hindi in 2018 and Bengali in 2020, and classifiers for violence and incitement in Hindi and Bengali this year. She said Facebook also now has hate speech classifiers in Urdu but not Pashto.

An undated document laid out how its content moderation operation struggled with Arabic-language dialects of multiple \u201cat-risk\u201d countries, leaving it constantly \u201cplaying catch up.\u201d The document acknowledged that, even within its Arabic-speaking reviewers, \u201cYemeni, Libyan, Saudi Arabian (really all Gulf nations) are either missing or have very low representation.\u201d Story continues below advertisement Facebook\u2019s Jones acknowledged that Arabic language content moderation \u201cpresents an enormous set of challenges.\u201d She said Facebook has made investments in staff over the last two years but recognizes \u201cwe still have more work to do.\u201d Three former Facebook employees who worked for the company\u2019s Asia Pacific and Middle East and North Africa offices in the past five years told Reuters they believed content moderation in their regions had not been a priority for Facebook management. These people said leadership did not understand the issues and did not devote enough staff and resources. Facebook\u2019s Jones said the California company cracks down on abuse by users outside the United States with the same intensity applied domestically. The company said it uses AI proactively to identify hate speech in more than 50 languages. Facebook said it bases its decisions on where to deploy AI on the size of the market and an assessment of the country\u2019s risks. It declined to say in how many countries it did not have functioning hate speech classifiers. 2:04 Whistleblower: Facebook harms children, weakens democracy Whistleblower: Facebook harms children, weakens democracy \u2013 Oct 5, 2021 Facebook also says it has 15,000 content moderators reviewing material from its global users. \u201cAdding more language expertise has been a key focus for us,\u201d Jones said. Story continues below advertisement In the past two years, it has hired people who can review content in Amharic, Oromo, Tigrinya, Somali, and Burmese, the company said, and this year added moderators in 12 new languages, including Haitian Creole. Facebook declined to say whether it requires a minimum number of content moderators for any language offered on the platform. LOST IN TRANSLATION Facebook\u2019s users are a powerful resource to identify content that violates the company\u2019s standards. The company has built a system for them to do so, but has acknowledged that the process can be time consuming and expensive for users in countries without reliable internet access. The reporting tool also has had bugs, design flaws and accessibility issues for some languages, according to the documents and digital rights activists who spoke with Reuters. Next Billion Network, a group of tech civic society groups working mostly across Asia, the Middle East and Africa, said in recent years it had repeatedly flagged problems with the reporting system to Facebook management. Those included a technical defect that kept Facebook\u2019s content review system from being able to see objectionable text accompanying videos and photos in some posts reported by users. That issue prevented serious violations, such as death threats in the text of these posts, from being properly assessed, the group and a former Facebook employee told Reuters. They said the issue was fixed in 2020. Story continues below advertisement Facebook said it continues to work to improve its reporting systems and takes feedback seriously. Read more: Done with doomscrolling? Why people choose to quit social media Language coverage remains a problem. A Facebook presentation from January, included in the documents, concluded \u201cthere is a huge gap in the Hate Speech reporting process in local languages\u201d for users in Afghanistan. The recent pullout of U.S. troops there after two decades has ignited an internal power struggle in the country. So-called \u201ccommunity standards\u201d \u2013 the rules that govern what users can post \u2013 are also not available in Afghanistan\u2019s main languages of Pashto and Dari, the author of the presentation said. A Reuters review this month found that community standards weren\u2019t available in about half the more than 110 languages that Facebook supports with features such as menus and prompts. Facebook said it aims to have these rules available in 59 languages by the end of the year, and in another 20 languages by the end of 2022.

How many gummy bears could you fit in an airplane? How long would it take to fill the Mariana Trench with peanut butter? Like most people, you\u2019d probably need some time and maybe a whiteboard to guess these answers. Not only are the questions difficult to imagine and rationalize, but also there\u2019s a lot of relevant background information needed to be able to make an accurate guess. Without collecting all relevant data, any answer is a guess. Imagine watching any sports game where you could only see one team and no scoreboard. You would be able to guess how each team is doing from positioning and reactions, but it would be difficult to say confidently which team is winning or who is more likely to win the entire game. It would be even more difficult to win bets against someone else watching normally on TV being spoon-fed a plethora of statistics and hearing the opinions of professional commentators. Despite the unfairness of this competition, this is how many people invest in stocks. Dark Pools can consist of more than half of the overall trade volume for a stock, and yet despite this huge imbalance, many people don\u2019t know they exist let alone monitor their activities. Gaining access and utilizing all the information available before making critical decisions can level the playing field and facilitate educated decisions. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event Data can help us make sense of big numbers and simplify complex ideas. Pluto is roughly 3 billion miles away, so how long would it take to walk there? About a billion hours, which is longer than watching all the content on all major streaming sites back to back 20,000 times. While the number and the analogy mean the same thing, one is substantially easier to understand intuitively than the other. Data explanation and visualization is a crucial component of understanding complex data points. Financial data is infamously one of the largest data sets in the world and endlessly complicated, so seeing it in easy-to-process graphs instead of raw metrics helps elucidate. It\u2019s difficult to visualize two numbers of orders of magnitude apart, but it\u2019s easy to see how big one circle is against another. Likewise, it\u2019s almost impossible to rationalize numbers without context for what they mean. Financial data is rife with jargon and acronyms that require a dictionary to read, let alone understand. Being able to process this information is knowing not just what the words mean, but also how it affects a company and how it compares to other similar companies. One of the best ways to use data is not as a standalone item in a complex sheet but as a living, breathing, dynamic guide for making better decisions. Data in isolation is hard to understand intuitively and even worse to try to act upon. Combined with visualizations, it can form a complete picture for faster understanding and superior intuitive answers. Not all data is created equal. This paradigm is far from original, with many of the most prominent data sources using citations and best practices to try to eliminate the uncertainty. One of the largest crypto data providers revealed that 65%-95% of all their data was inaccurate and untrustworthy. In the wake of the LIBOR scandal , cracks in the financial system were exposed and the underbelly of market manipulation was revealed. Recently, payment for order flow was popularized, selling people\u2019s trades to big institutions and allowing them to take profit away from investors. Far from novel, these are just several examples of data being difficult to trust. The commonality from all three of these is a fundamental agency problem; each of these groups stood to gain financially from manipulating their data or failing to correct incorrect data. The solution is to find data sources that are fundamentally incentivized to provide accurate data. Most brokers provide access to financial data, but often there is a conflict of interest, such as a broker selling their own stock, or fees on trading either explicit or invisible through slippage . For this reason, it\u2019s essential to carefully evaluate the trustworthiness of data sources and not take information at face value, especially when critical decisions are being made from it. Healthy skepticism and asking if there is a conflict of interest can expose early on whether a data set is purely analytical or might be inaccurate and skewed. Data is one of the most valuable resources in the world. Almost half of the top seven biggest companies in the world use data as their primary product for good reason. Making informed, objective decisions can eliminate uncertainty on correct choices and often guarantee the best possible outcomes. Learning to make these decisions off of comprehensive, well understood and trustworthy data can drastically increase the effectiveness of any decision and bring order to an otherwise chaotic world.

    "full_description": "Taking advantage of the growing craze of the dystopian South Korean horror series Squad Games\u2014cybercriminals are now targetting unsuspecting individuals in the name of Netflix\u2019s series. Cybersecurity expert and researcher Lukas Stefanko, who studies malware at security firm ESET, through a tweet revealed that a notorious app called \u2018Squid Wallpaper 4K HD\u2019, which was available on Google Play Store (not available now), was developed by threat actors to infect Android phones with the Joker malware. Interestingly, the Joker malware has been spotted on Google Play Store earlier as well, but this is the first instance of a Squid Game-based app being used to spread it. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png What happens if you download the app? Stefanko in his post notes that the malicious app had been installed more than 5,000 times before it was identified and taken down. The app could download and execute native libraries and even execute malicious apps on the target devices. Squid Game themed Android Joker 1) downloads and executes native lib 2) native lib downloads and executes apk payload Running this app on device might result in malicious ad-fraud and/or unwanted SMS subscription actionshttps://t.co/PTDtPlUkBy pic.twitter.com/AFs8gkEuab \u2014 Lukas Stefanko (@LukasStefanko) October 19, 2021 The cyber researcher further warned that the flagged app allowed hackers to carry out \u201cmalicious ad-fraud and/or unwanted SMS subscription actions\u201d. Besides gaining unauthorised access to one\u2019s bills, the malware also allows certain operations without receiving consent from the user. Read more | What is Joker malware that affected apps on Google Play store? Cybercriminals could also sign up affected users for premium services, which can cost them a lot of money. It is worth noting that anyone downloading the \u201cSquid Game Wallpaper 4K HD\u201d app is said to be falling victim to a costly SMS scam. How can you stay safe? Stefanko asserted in the tweet that at least 200 apps based on Squid Game are available on Google Play. The most downloaded out of these apps reached one million downloads within 10 days.\u201cSeems like a great opportunity to make money on in-app ads from one of the most popular TV shows without an official game,\u201d he stated. Considering how cybercriminals can use the craze to trick people into falling trap to such malware, users need to be very cautious while installing any applications on their devices. The best course of action for Android users is to delete such apps from their devices to minimize the chances of getting the Joker malware. In addition, packing your device with anti-malware can go a long way to protect against viruses.",

That actor\u2014known as Nobelium\u2014is a hacking group suspected of being affiliated with the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). The recent wave came between July 1 and October 19 this year, and included over 140 retail companies and technology service providers. Tom Burt, Corporate Vice President at Microsoft says \"as many as 14\" of these were left compromised, though of the 600+ other targets, Burt declares the hacking success rate to be \"in the low single digits,\" (via. BleepingComputer ). To put the numbers into perspective, whether or not the attacks were successful, the recent wave includes more instances in the past four or so months than the past three years combined . As Burt notes, \"by comparison, prior to July 1, 2021, we had notified customers about attacks from all nation-state actors 20,500 times over the past three years.\" Known also as APT29, Cozy Bear, or The Dukes, the group is thought to be working for potentially several Russian intelligence agencies, and allegedly breached several US government agencies last year by hacking through SolarWinds software solutions, on what was deemed a \"broad scope cyber espionage campaign.\" The recent attacks go to show that Nobelium is not letting up. And the group's offense is expansive, with its arsenal including persistent malware strains, phishing campaigns, as well as its own malware and shellcode downloaders, named 'BoomBox,' and 'VaporRage,' respectively. Best CPU for gaming : the top chips from Intel and AMD Best graphics card : your perfect pixel-pusher awaits Best SSD for gaming : get into the game ahead of the rest Microsoft is now sharing anti-Nobelium specific measures it recommends service providers and tech organisations take, in order to help prevent future attacks. In the security notice, Microsoft details some of Nobelium's tactics, including \"the abuse of indirect paths and trust relationships to target and gain access to victims of interest for intelligence gain. \"In the most recent campaign, this has manifested in a compromise-one-to-compromise-many approach\u2014exploiting the service providers\u2019 trust chain to gain broad access to multiple customer tenants for subsequent attacks.\" Welcome to a world where countries are believed to be waging silent cyberwars in the backdrop of our everyday lives.

    "full_description": "New research revealed that the majority of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are owned by whales \u2014 big investors that have tied up most available options \u2014 accounting for over 80 percent of the market. Individual investors pooled together accounted for less than 20 percent of the total NFT market on Ethereum, between April 1 and September 25, 2021, according to research by blockchain analytics platform Moonstream. NFTs are virtual collectibles which make use of blockchain technology to identify the ownership of virtual assets, which could be music, videos, images, or any other digital files such as in-game equipment or characters. And over the course of this year, NFTs have been one of the hottest assets in the crypto space , ever since one collection was auctioned for $69 million , or over Rs. 500 crore. But it's perhaps no surprise that most of the holdings are concentrated among the big investors. Blockchain analytics platform Moonstream said that their scan of 1,145,767 blocks yielded transfer activity for 7,020,950 tokens from 9,292 Ethereum NFT contracts across 727,102 addresses. As highlighted by the report , these NFT mints and transfers play a key role in forming the core of the Ethereum dataset. \u201cMany of those owners are marketplaces and clearinghouses like OpenSea, Nifty Gateway, and other platforms of the same ilk,\u201d the report said listing some NFT whales on Ethereum. While the current distribution pattern of the NFTs on the Ethereum network shows an inclination towards whale wallets, the report has noted that small NFT investors are also around, participating in the growth of this space. \u201cWhat this data shows us is that the Ethereum NFT market is open in the sense the vast majority of its participants are small-time purchasers who likely make their purchases manually,\u201d the report highlighted. Currently, 83.29 percent Ethereum enthusiasts own the remaining 19.02 percent of the NFTs available on the blockchain. With the likes of several celebrities like Amitabh Bachchan, Salman Khan, and Snoop Dogg among others, the NFT space is prospering in several parts of the world. NFT sales volume surged to $10.7 billion (roughly Rs. 79,820 crore) in the third quarter of 2021, according to data from market tracker DappRadar . This figure is eight times more than what it was in the previous quarter. Surging sales and hefty prices of NFTs \u2014 items that do not physically exist \u2014 have baffled many, but the multi-fold growth is showing no depreciation whatsoever. On the biggest NFT marketplace, OpenSea, sales volumes hit $3.4 billion (roughly Rs. 25,320 crore) in August and remained strong even in September when the global stock markets faltered. There are some serious environmental impacts associated with NFTs though. Recently, Chris Hinkle, the chief technical officer at the US-based TRG Datacenters said that most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain which has been largely criticised because a single transaction has a carbon footprint equivalent to 140,893 Visa credit card transactions. \u201cEthereum has promised to cut its energy consumption by 99 percent come early 2022. As NFTs evolve and become more commonplace, it's critical that as NFTs grow in popularity they take steps to safeguard our environment from further negative impact,\u201d Hinkle had said in an NFT-focussed report by TRG Datacenters.",

Journalists from a variety of newsrooms, large and small, worked together to gain access to thousands of pages of internal company documents obtained by Frances Haugen , the former Facebook product manager-turned-whistleblower. A separate consortium of European news outlets had access to the same set of documents, and members of both groups began publishing content related to their analysis of the materials at 7 a.m. EDT on Monday, Oct. 25. That date and time was set by the partner news organizations to give everyone in the consortium an opportunity to fully analyze the documents, report out relevant details, and to give Facebook\u2019s public relations staff ample time to respond to questions and inquiries raised by that reporting.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Founder of Predikly , a data innovation company, and venture partner with Z Nation Lab, a startup accelerator. getty Now that Covid-19 has put the impetus on all organizations across the technology, finance and HR fields to digitize and improve productivity, RPA (robotic process automation) is top-of-mind for nearly everyone. As it becomes more mainstream, small and medium-sized businesses must start to get the most out of this technology. After serving many SMB customers with employees between 1,500 and 7,500, I've learned that when it comes to RPA, skills shortages, iterating and hiring are some of the key challenges organizations face while embracing this technology. In particular, because the cost of iteration is so high, SMBs are impacted most by these digitization initiatives. Even though organizations know they should be embracing RPA, they often aren't sure where to start, and this is where many of them find themselves bottlenecked. I've worked with over 50 customers and prospects on developing use cases for RPA and have accumulated over 2,500 bots in the process. My goal is to share the information I've learned from these projects to help you better identify where to start with RPA. I've found that this information both helps organizations learn where to start and helps them identify whether they are actually ready to start in the first place. You don't want to sink several thousands of dollars into a project you aren't ready to take on in full. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event Where Is RPA Useful? RPA is useful in countless industries and has various applications across the board, from transcript processing and new-student registration in the education industry to data entry, case submission and pharmacy processing in the health care industry. In the finance industry, accounts payable teams have to perform multiple processes on a regular basis in multiple departments. Often, they have to perform these tasks manually. With the help of a batch creation bot, teams can sign off on batches of similar reports instead of individual reports. Communication bots can also streamline email transactions with all suppliers listed in a batch. One of our clients has over 25 legal entities. Every month, they record multiple transactions in a general ledger. We developed a bot to automate this monthly process to help them close out their monthly books. The bot is able to open the general ledger, extract data on the entries within, then add the data to the organization's ERP system. You can imagine how much time this process would take manually. In the oil and gas industry, RPA can be used to process receipts, manage orders and import line closures. In real estate, estate listings and country record searches can be automated. In mortgage banking, flood guard and credit invoice orders can be automated. If there is a manual process in your organization that is tedious and that takes valuable time away from your employees, it's worth looking into whether that process can be automated. Getting RPA Right It's important to note here that your first implementation of RPA may not immediately result in a higher ROI. Sometimes, it takes a minimum of three years to see results. But don't give up! We've seen that organizations with larger backlogs tend to see results faster with RPA than those that apply RPA to a singular process. As such, implementing RPA for multiple use cases will help you better justify the fixed cost of investing in a software solution. When investing in RPA, you need the support of top-level executives in your organization, and they need to be involved in its implementation. It's also important to maintain both early and consistent communication with any vendors you might be vetting for a solution, as this will help you grow your program faster. Additionally, I would highly suggest embracing an agile development strategy, rather than a waterfall development strategy when implementing RPA. This will help you automate processes more efficiently and deliver the highest-quality product possible within your time and budget constraints. Because you need your RPA process to be flexible, agile development is a perfect match. I hope this has given you a few use cases to consider when starting your own RPA journey. I wish you the best!

This work was published in Science Advances . Transition metal phosphorus trichalcogenides (MPX 3 , X= S or Se; M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, etc.), as the representatives of two-dimensional (2D) vdW magnetic materials , have gained wide attention in various fields, including superconductivity, optoelectronics and catalysis. In particular, NiPS 3 exhibits intriguing quantum properties owing to the intrinsic strong charge-spin correlation effects. It is an antiferromagnetic (AFM) material with a model Hamiltonian of the XXZ type. In this study, researchers found that the existence of crystal defects in chemically synthesized Ni 1-x Co x PS 3 nanosheets, i.e., sulfur vacancies (S v ), could suppress the strong intralayer antiferromagnetic exchange interaction (J3) in NiPS 3 , and the Co substitution decreases the formation energy of S v during the synthesis process. Besides, they found that the conversion synthesis process for the Ni 1-x Co x PS 3 nanosheets are necessary to promote the formation of S v . S v do not seem to exist in sufficient quantity in chemical vapor transport grown single crystal. The presence of S v in Ni 1-x Co x PS 3 nanosheets led to the suppression of long-range AFM correlations while other competing ferromagnetic exchange interactions dominate at low temperatures, creating a magnetically frustrated system. As a consequence, the magnetic field required to tune this defect mediated ferromagnetic state (< 300 oersted) is much lower than the value needed to tune a typical vdW antiferromagnet (> several thousand oersted), which made these nanosheets more appealing for spintronic applications. Theoretically, in correlated NiPS 3 , the half-filled Ni e g orbitals coupled with half-filled S 3 p orbitals, which mediates the electron hooping between neighboring Ni sites through superexchange interaction. Owing to the negative charge transfer energy, the S ligand transfers one electron to the half-filled e g Ni 3 d orbital to form a d 9 L ground state , namely negative charge transfer (NCT) state. NCT state also dominates between antiferromagnetically aligned neighboring Ni atoms. In this case, the presence of S v could affect the electronic correlation and then tune the magnetic ordering in correlated NiPS 3 . These findings provide a less explored route for controlling competing correlated states and magnetic ordering by defect engineering in 2D vdW magnets. Explore further",

    "full_description": "Even after more than 30 years of research, high-temperature superconductivity is still one of the great unsolved mysteries of materials physics. The exact mechanism that causes certain materials to still conduct electric current without any resistance even at relatively high temperatures is still not fully understood. Two years ago, a new class of promising superconductors was discovered: so-called layered nickelates. For the first time, a research team at TU Wien has now succeeded in determining important parameters of these novel superconductors by comparing theory and experiment. This means that for the first time a theoretical model is now available that can be used to understand the electronic mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity in these materials. In search of high-temperature superconductors Many superconductors are known today, but most of them are only superconducting at extremely low temperatures, close to absolute zero. Materials that remain superconducting at higher temperatures are called \"high-temperature superconductors\"\u2014even though these \"high\" temperatures (often in the order of magnitude of less than -200\u00b0C) are still extremely cold by human standards. Finding a material that still remains superconducting at significantly higher temperatures would be a revolutionary discovery that would open the door to many new technologies. For a long time, the so-called cuprates were considered particularly exciting candidates\u2014a class of materials containing copper atoms. Now, however, another class of materials could turn out to be even more promising: Nickelates, which have a similar structure to cuprates, but with nickel instead of copper. \"There has been a lot of research on cuprates, and it has been possible to dramatically increase the critical temperature up to which the material remains superconducting. If similar progress can be made with the newly discovered nickelates, it would be a huge step forward,\" says Prof. Jan Kune\u0161 from the Institute of Solid State Physics at TU Wien. Hard-to-access parameters Theoretical models describing the behavior of such superconductors already exist. The problem, however, is that in order to use these models, one must know certain material parameters that are difficult to determine. \"The charge transfer energy plays a key role,\" explains Jan Kune\u0161. \"This value tells us how much energy you have to add to the system to transfer an electron from a nickel atom to an oxygen atom.\" Unfortunately, this value cannot be measured directly, and theoretical calculations are extremely complicated and imprecise. Therefore, Atsushi Hariki, a member of Jan Kune\u0161' research group, developed a method to determine this parameter indirectly: When the material is examined with X-rays, the results also depend on the charge transfer energy. \"We calculated details of the X-ray spectrum that are particularly sensitive to this parameter and compared our results with measurements of different X-ray spectroscopy methods,\" explains Jan Kune\u0161. \"In this way, we can determine the appropriate value\u2014and this value can now be inserted into the computational models used to describe the superconductivity of the material.\" Important prerequisite for the search for better nickelates Thus, for the first time, it has now been possible to explain the electronic structure of the material precisely and to set up a parameterised theoretical model for describing superconductivity in nickelates. \"With this, we can now get to the bottom of the question of how the mechanics of the effect can be explained at the electronic level,\" says Jan Kune\u0161. \"Which orbitals play a decisive role? Which parameters matter in detail? That's what you need to know if you want to find out how to improve this material further, so that one day you might be able to produce new nickelates whose superconductivity persists up to even significantly higher temperatures.\" Explore further",

    "full_description": "Some PC games use anti-tamper tech to help prevent piracy, but it can come with a serious performance hit as Shadow of the Tomb Raider has just revealed. As DSOG reports , last week Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics decided to remove Denuvo's digital-rights management (DRM) and anti-tamper technology from Shadow of the Tomb Raider on PC. The update on Steam also added an improved shadow denoiser, upgraded Nvidia DLSS, and multiplayer updates, but no CPU or memory performance improvements were noted. For some reason, publisher Square Enix rolled back the update, but DSOG managed to download and benchmark the Steam version of the game with Denuvo removed. They used a PC running a Core i9 9900K ,16GB of DDR4 RAM (3,600Mhz), a GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card, and Windows 10 64-bit. What they discovered was a significant performance improvement. At the highest settings running at 1080p there was a small improvement in performance, but switching to Lowest settings saw the frame rate jump by between 8-17 fps compared to the Denuvo-protected version. On older CPUs the performance improvement should be even higher, and if Hyper-Threading is disabled, the difference between the two versions jumped as high as 30 fps. If you're running a fairly new gaming PC then removing Denuvo will offer a slight performance gain, but for anyone wishing to play the latest games using an older PC, Denuvo could make the difference between a game being playable or not. At least, that's what these benchmarks suggest.",

    "content": null,
    "pubDate": "2021-10-25 11:37:00",
    "full_description": "Facebook employees have warned for years that as the company raced to become a global service it was failing to police abusive content in countries where such speech was likely to cause the most harm, according to interviews with five former employees and internal company documents viewed by Reuters. For over a decade, Facebook has pushed to become the world's dominant online platform. It currently operates in more than 190 countries and boasts more than 2.8 billion monthly users who post content in more than 160 languages. But its efforts to prevent its products from becoming conduits for hate speech, inflammatory rhetoric and misinformation - some which has been blamed for inciting violence - have not kept pace with its global expansion. Internal company documents viewed by Reuters show Facebook has known that it hasn't hired enough workers who possess both the language skills and knowledge of local events needed to identify objectionable posts from users in a number of developing countries. The documents also showed that the artificial intelligence systems Facebook employs to root out such content frequently aren't up to the task, either; and that the company hasn't made it easy for its global users themselves to flag posts that violate the site's rules. Those shortcomings, employees warned in the documents, could limit the company's ability to make good on its promise to block hate speech and other rule-breaking posts in places from Afghanistan to Yemen. In a review posted to Facebook's internal message board last year regarding ways the company identifies abuses on its site, one employee reported \"significant gaps\" in certain countries at risk of real-world violence, especially Myanmar and Ethiopia. The documents are among a cache of disclosures made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager who left the company in May. Reuters was among a group of news organizations able to view the documents, which include presentations, reports and posts shared on the company's internal message board. Their existence was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Facebook spokesperson Mavis Jones said in a statement that the company has native speakers worldwide reviewing content in more than 70 languages, as well as experts in humanitarian and human rights issues. She said these teams are working to stop abuse on Facebook's platform in places where there is a heightened risk of conflict and violence. \"We know these challenges are real and we are proud of the work we've done to date,\" Jones said. Still, the cache of internal Facebook documents offers detailed snapshots of how employees in recent years have sounded alarms about problems with the company's tools - both human and technological - aimed at rooting out or blocking speech that violated its own standards. The material expands upon Reuters' previous reporting https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/myanmar-facebook-hate on Myanmar and other countries https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-india-content/facebook-a-megaphone-for-hate-against-indian-minorities-idUSKBN1X929F, where the world's largest social network has failed repeatedly to protect users from problems on its own platform and has struggled to monitor content across languages. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-languages-insight-idUSKCN1RZ0DW Among the weaknesses cited were a lack of screening algorithms for languages used in some of the countries Facebook has deemed most \"at-risk\" for potential real-world harm and violence stemming from abuses on its site. The company designates countries \"at-risk\" based on variables including unrest, ethnic violence, the number of users and existing laws, two former staffers told Reuters. The system aims to steer resources to places where abuses on its site could have the most severe impact, the people said. Facebook reviews and prioritizes these countries every six months in line with United Nations guidelines aimed at helping companies prevent and remedy human rights abuses in their business operations, spokesperson Jones said. In 2018, United Nations experts investigating a brutal campaign of killings and expulsions against Myanmar's Rohingya Muslim minority said Facebook was widely used to spread hate speech toward them. That prompted the company to increase its staffing in vulnerable countries, a former employee told Reuters. Facebook has said it should have done more to prevent the platform being used to incite offline violence in the country. Ashraf Zeitoon, Facebook's former head of policy for the Middle East and North Africa, who left in 2017, said the company's approach to global growth has been \"colonial,\" focused on monetization without safety measures. More than 90% of Facebook's monthly active users are outside the United States or Canada. LANGUAGE ISSUES Facebook has long touted the importance of its artificial-intelligence (AI) systems, in combination with human review, as a way of tackling objectionable and dangerous content on its platforms. Machine-learning systems can detect such content with varying levels of accuracy. But languages spoken outside the United States, Canada and Europe have been a stumbling block for Facebook's automated content moderation, the documents provided to the government by Haugen show. The company lacks AI systems to detect abusive posts in a number of languages used on its platform. In 2020, for example, the company did not have screening algorithms known as \"classifiers\" to find misinformation in Burmese, the language of Myanmar, or hate speech in the Ethiopian languages of Oromo or Amharic, a document showed. These gaps can allow abusive posts to proliferate in the countries where Facebook itself has determined the risk of real-world harm is high. Reuters this month found posts in Amharic, one of Ethiopia's most common languages, referring to different ethnic groups as the enemy and issuing them death threats. A nearly year-long conflict in the country between the Ethiopian government and rebel forces in the Tigray region has killed thousands of people and displaced more than 2 million. Facebook spokesperson Jones said the company now has proactive detection technology to detect hate speech in Oromo and Amharic and has hired more people with \"language, country and topic expertise,\" including people who have worked in Myanmar and Ethiopia. In an undated document, which a person familiar with the disclosures said was from 2021, Facebook employees also shared examples of \"fear-mongering, anti-Muslim narratives\" spread on the site in India, including calls to oust the large minority Muslim population there. \"Our lack of Hindi and Bengali classifiers means much of this content is never flagged or actioned,\" the document said. Internal posts and comments by employees this year also noted the lack of classifiers in the Urdu and Pashto languages to screen problematic content posted by users in Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. Jones said Facebook added hate speech classifiers for Hindi in 2018 and Bengali in 2020, and classifiers for violence and incitement in Hindi and Bengali this year. She said Facebook also now has hate speech classifiers in Urdu but not Pashto. Facebook's human review of posts, which is crucial for nuanced problems like hate speech, also has gaps across key languages, the documents show. An undated document laid out how its content moderation operation struggled with Arabic-language dialects of multiple \"at-risk\" countries, leaving it constantly \"playing catch up.\" The document acknowledged that, even within its Arabic-speaking reviewers, \"Yemeni, Libyan, Saudi Arabian (really all Gulf nations) are either missing or have very low representation.\" Facebook's Jones acknowledged that Arabic language content moderation \"presents an enormous set of challenges.\" She said Facebook has made investments in staff over the last two years but recognizes \"we still have more work to do.\" Three former Facebook employees who worked for the company's Asia Pacific and Middle East and North Africa offices in the past five years told Reuters they believed content moderation in their regions had not been a priority for Facebook management. These people said leadership did not understand the issues and did not devote enough staff and resources. Facebook's Jones said the California company cracks down on abuse by users outside the United States with the same intensity applied domestically. The company said it uses AI proactively to identify hate speech in more than 50 languages. Facebook said it bases its decisions on where to deploy AI on the size of the market and an assessment of the country's risks. It declined to say in how many countries it did not have functioning hate speech classifiers. Facebook also says it has 15,000 content moderators reviewing material from its global users. \"Adding more language expertise has been a key focus for us,\" Jones said. In the past two years, it has hired people who can review content in Amharic, Oromo, Tigrinya, Somali, and Burmese, the company said, and this year added moderators in 12 new languages, including Haitian Creole. Facebook declined to say whether it requires a minimum number of content moderators for any language offered on the platform. LOST IN TRANSLATION Facebook's users are a powerful resource to identify content that violates the company's standards. The company has built a system for them to do so, but has acknowledged that the process can be time consuming and expensive for users in countries without reliable internet access. The reporting tool also has had bugs, design flaws and accessibility issues for some languages, according to the documents and digital rights activists who spoke with Reuters. Next Billion Network, a group of tech civic society groups working mostly across Asia, the Middle East and Africa, said in recent years it had repeatedly flagged problems with the reporting system to Facebook management. Those included a technical defect that kept Facebook's content review system from being able to see objectionable text accompanying videos and photos in some posts reported by users. That issue prevented serious violations, such as death threats in the text of these posts, from being properly assessed, the group and a former Facebook employee told Reuters. They said the issue was fixed in 2020. Facebook said it continues to work to improve its reporting systems and takes feedback seriously. Language coverage remains a problem. A Facebook presentation from January, included in the documents, concluded \"there is a huge gap in the Hate Speech reporting process in local languages\" for users in Afghanistan. The recent pullout of U.S. troops there after two decades has ignited an internal power struggle in the country. So-called \"community standards\" - the rules that govern what users can post - are also not available in Afghanistan's main languages of Pashto and Dari, the author of the presentation said. A Reuters review this month found that community standards weren't available in about half the more than 110 languages that Facebook supports with features such as menus and prompts. Facebook said it aims to have these rules available in 59 languages by the end of the year, and in another 20 languages by the end of 2022.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Amit Samsukha, Director & CTO at EmizenTech , is an eCommerce consultant, proficient at improvising IT infrastructure. getty The worldwide lockdown has increased online purchases as compared to previous years. In 2020, about 42% of the U.S. population bought groceries online because of Covid-19, which is nearly twice the amount recorded in 2018. Because of that, retailers are waiting for things to return to normal to witness increased footfall in their physical stores again. So, what can store owners do to raise foot traffic? One way to invite that crowd back to stores and increase in-store sales is to adopt an online-to-offline (O2O) retail strategy. Let's understand O2O commerce better, along with its benefits. What's online-to-offline (O2O) commerce? O2O commerce is a business model that strives to move potential customers from online platforms to physical stores. This approach aims to make the digital experience seamless at every stage: before, during and after the purchase. Retailers also run various advertising and email campaigns to attract online customers to make purchases from brick-and-mortar stores. How does O2O commerce work? About 80% of shoppers will buy an item from a physical store instead of purchasing it online if they have an urgent need for it. By following an O2O commerce strategy, retailers can create awareness for their goods and services online and encourage customers to visit brick-and-mortar stores to make purchases. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event With an O2O retail strategy, companies help customers by: \u2022 Enabling shoppers to place their orders online, even while at a physical store using mobile retail kiosks. \u2022 Allowing products to be purchased online and picked up from physical stores. \u2022 Offering in-store returns or exchanges of goods purchased online. In this way, O2O commerce allows customers to move between online and offline stores with ease. Benefits Of The O2O Business Model Curbside pickup and in-store returns save on logistics costs and help draw people into the store. When Covid-19 left retailers with locked stores, the buy-online-pick-up-in-store (BOPIS) model, also known as curbside pickup, emerged as their savior. The results of a survey of over 1,000 consumers conducted in February 2021 show that about 35% of U.S. online shoppers chose curbside pickup during the previous six months. Additionally, as of early 2021, about 50% of top retail chains provided curbside pickup. The BOPIS model allows users to order products online and pick up in store. Together with allowing online purchases to be returned in physical stores, these O2O services assist merchants in cutting shipping charges. Retailers can also utilize a percentage of their physical store's space to store products that have been ordered online through e-commerce stores. This way, retailers can reduce the expenses of third-party logistics partners. So, by following this O2O commerce trend, retailers can attract online customers to offline stores. Once they reach the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers also have the opportunity to entice customers to buy other products. It improves the customer experience, brand awareness and sales. About 61% of shoppers prefer shopping with brands that have a physical location rather than those with e-commerce stores only. Brands with online and offline stores can offer their customers a chance to connect with their sales reps, touch and feel the products in person and have in-store experiences that may motivate them to buy from the physical stores. Retailers can also allow customers to use reward points and discount coupons both online and offline to get products at a discounted price. When customers go online, they can shop from various channels and stores. For instance, social media sites usually have e-commerce features. Retailers can use these various online channels to build relationships and ultimately draw potential customers to their brick-and-mortar stores. Wrapping Up These insights suggest that the future of O2O commerce is bright. An O2O strategy allows retailers to treat online and offline shopping channels as complementary to each other, instead of competitors. By adopting O2O commerce, they can draw more customers to their offline stores and potentially improve the bottom line.

The Plastic Flamingo, or \u201cThe Plaf\u201d, as they are commonly known, collect the waste, shred it and then mould it into posts and planks called \u201ceco-lumber\u201d that can be used for fencing, decking or even to make disaster-relief shelters. If you would own these eco-lumbers made from plastic waste, what would you build? Comment your answers below \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/XangoQe7hz \u2014 The Plaf (@zeplaf) September 16, 2021 \u201c(It) is 100% upcycled material, 100% made from plastic waste materials, we also include some additives and colorants and it is rot-free, maintenance-free, and splinter-free,\u201d said Erica Reyes, The Plaf\u2019s chief operating officer. Having collected over 100 tonnes of plastic waste to date, the social enterprise is doing its bit to address a local problem that has global ramifications. Approximately 80% of global ocean plastic comes from Asian rivers, and the Philippines alone contributes a third of that total, according to a 2021 report by Oxford University\u2019s Our World in Data. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png Waterproof planks made of plastics are stacked in the factory of social enterprise The Plastic Flamingo or The Plaf, in Muntinlupa, Philippines, October 18, 2021. (REUTERS) The Philippines does not have a clear strategy on tackling its plastics problem and its environment department has said it has been in contact with manufacturers to identify ways to manage waste. COVID-19 , though, has made the battle against plastic waste harder to win. Some 300 million tonnes of plastic waste are produced annually, according to the United Nations Environment Programme, a problem that has been exacerbated by the pandemic which sparked a rush for plastic face shields, gloves, takeaway food containers and bubble wrap as online shopping surged. \u201cPeople are unaware of how to dispose of these plastics,\u201d said Allison Tan, The Plaf\u2019s marketing associate. \u201cWe give that avenue that instead of putting it in landfills or oceans\u2026you give it to recycling centres like us and we would upcycle them into better products.\u201d As well as tackling waste problems, the group says it is in talks with other non-government organisations to help rebuild houses destroyed by typhoons using their sustainable building materials.",

    "full_description": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Airbus Ventures announced an investment Oct. 25 in ispace, the Toyko-based company preparing to send its first lander to the moon next year. Airbus Ventures brought ispace into its portfolio because \u201cit\u2019s an extraordinary team that has positioned the right technologies at the right time,\u201d Lewis Pinault, the Airbus Ventures partner who leads the firm\u2019s investments in Asia, told SpaceNews . \u201cThey have every chance of being the first private company on the moon.\u201d Airbus Ventures also is enthusiastic about ispace\u2019s plan to acquire data on lunar mineral and energy resources, Pinault said. Since it was founded in Japan in 2010, ispace has established offices in Luxembourg and Denver , and relationships with space agencies and private companies around the world. A Series 1 ispace lunar lander is undergoing final assembly in an ArianeGroup facility in Germany ahead of its flight scheduled for the second half of 2022 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The ispace\u2019s lander is slated to deliver lunar payloads for the UAE-based Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre, the Japanese Space Agency JAXA, and commercial firms in Japan and Canada. Like ispace, Airbus Ventures is eager to explore how the moon\u2019s natural resources could provide clean energy and rare metals to support life on Earth. The moon also \u201chas the opportunity to become the first space for off-world manufacturing, which would alleviate the stresses that manufacturing puts on our planet,\u201d Pinault said. Ispace is \u201cwell-positioned to build a data-driven business to help us think differently about the future of the moon as a partner of the Earth for Earth sustainability,\u201d he added. Ispace has raised approximately $200 million to date, according to the Oct. 25 news release. After announcing that it raised $46 million in a Series C investment round in August, ispace announced Oct. 20 that Axiom Asia Private Capital was providing additional funding as part of an extension to the Series C round. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to receive this investment from a truly global organization like Airbus Ventures, which is another first direct investment from an international institutional investor for ispace, along with Axiom Asia Private Capital,\u201d ispace CEO Takeshi Hakamada, said in a statement. In 2023, ispace plans to launch its second lunar mission. Airbus Ventures\u2019 space portfolio also includes Morpheus Space and LeoLabs . Airbus Ventures and Axiom Asia Private Capital did not disclosed the value of their investments in ispace.",

Bing, for anyone who may need reminding, is Microsoft's own search engine, designed to rival the likes of Google in offering information to users across the globe.

As the nail in the coffin of its competitors, it has 2.4GHz Wireless, Bluetooth, and wired connectivity. The Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed isn\u2019t that new of a release, hitting the shelves back in 2019. However, it remains a solid contender if you\u2019re looking for a reliable wireless gaming mouse. Its 16,000 DPI and up to 40G acceleration remain impressive even in 2021 standards, as is its 285 hours of battery life (more if you\u2019re using Bluetooth). And, for a budget option, this has fully customizable buttons and onboard memory so you can take up to five profiles with you wherever you go. Both HyperSpeed wireless and Bluetooth connectivity are on hand as well for versatility. Read the full review: Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed The aptly-named Razer Basilisk Ultimate might cost a pretty penny, but the fact that it\u2019s loaded with extra frills makes it well worth the money if you can spare it. This wireless gaming mouse comes with up to 20,000DPI, dual connectivity, onboard memory for up to five profiles, and practically latency-free performance. But, what sets it apart from all others is that it\u2019s highly customizable. There are 11 programmable buttons here, 14 customizable Razer Chroma RBG lighting zones, and even a scroll wheel whose resistance you can customize to fit your comfort level. Its Chroma-enabled charging dock makes your setup look cool and, of course, charging a breeze. Read the full review: Razer Basilisk Ultimate HyperX\u2019s offering, the HyperX Pulsefire Dart, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t need a dedicated dock to juice up \u2013 although the manufacturer does sell its own wireless charger if you\u2019d like to complete the set. This wireless mouse is Qi-certified for wireless charging, which means that any Qi wireless chargers should do the trick. But, there\u2019s more to love here, like its leatherette-padded sides to give users a good grip, up to 5 DPI settings to quickly cycle through, and a USB wireless adapter included that lets you extend the mouse\u2019s signal range. Customizations also abound via the HyperX Ngenuity Software Read the full review: HyperX Pulsefire Dart Much like most of Roccat\u2019s releases, the Roccat Kain 202 AIMO is a smart-looking mouse, touting a design that\u2019s equal parts angular and curvy, game-esque and sophisticated. Even its AIMO Illumination RGB lighting feels elegant somehow. And, much like its design, it\u2019s luxurious to use as well thanks to its ergonomic design and Titan Click switches. In fact, it delivers a great and satisfying click response alongside its high-end performance. Those concerned with numbers should be happy with its 16,000 DPI, 1,000Hz polling rate, 40G acceleration, and 512kB onboard memory. We only wish the battery life was better, but at least it\u2019s rechargeable. Read the full review: Roccat Kain 202 AIMO",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Co-Founder of Women in Cloud . I influence brands and entrepreneurs to unlock economic access through digital strategy and partnerships. getty The early 2010s marked a change in the way workforces were structured around the world. The world was greatly focused on gender diversity, and, in theory, those goals were realized. Yet, time and time again, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) were looked at as a box that needed to be checked in the organizational structure until now. It's no longer a secret that enabling diverse teams is a good business decision while contributing to building an inclusive economy. DEI efforts not only benefit organizations but, according to the results of research conducted by economists from the University of Chicago and Standard University, the last 50 years of economic history further proves that an inclusive workforce makes everybody wealthier and helps communities prosper. What are we missing? So, there's really no downside to creating a diverse and inclusive workplace while being equitable. Yet, somehow, corporate America has consistently fallen short in this regard, as organizations ignore one simple fact: DEI is about people. People representation is at the core of DEI practices. Governments, corporations and community organizations are often so focused on meeting DEI goals that the basic purpose behind these efforts is easily forgotten. The DEI model is built to bring a sense of belonging to people in workforces worldwide. Nothing screams infinite opportunities and possibilities like watching somebody relatable to you break all barriers and make it! MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event But how do we move away from DEI reports and meeting quotas? The pandemic shed light on policies and issues that have been overlooked for decades. This has led to companies now stepping forward and thinking of improvements to their DEI strategies as something that must be done rather than something that should be done . As we move forward in an attempt to further enforce and infuse DEI practices in corporations and community organizations in a post-pandemic world, we're presented with a perfect opportunity to shift toward people representation in several areas. These include the board and leadership, supplier networks, the channel ecosystem, the employee workforce and community representation. Multilevel representation opens up and drives cultural change in organizations to develop an inclusive corporate strategy and digital transformation to support a hybrid workforce. Tools that can be used to accelerate your DEI practices. As we shift our DEI focus to people rather than just the growth of the company, we need to continue adopting new working styles, organizational restructuring and tools that can measure people's performance to create a long-standing impact. These include the following methods and tools: \u2022 Inclusion Scorecard: An inclusion scorecard is designed to measure representation across the organization. The first step to embark on is to ensure representation in all areas of the company. This should start at the top with the board and C-suite and encompass not only the employees but also suppliers and channels. \u2022 People Representation Map: The scorecard will show you the diversity of people in your organization and gaps in representation that need to be filled, paving a path for the second tool, the people representation map. This tool will enable you to eliminate any unconscious bias in the organization across all levels by prompting you to ask the question, \"Do I have the right people represented?\" \u2022 Surveys: This tried and tested tool \u2014 the survey \u2014 assists leadership in establishing and enforcing DEI practices. Including questions like \"Do I belong here?\" \"Am I safe here?\" \"Am I valued here?\" and \"Can I look up to leadership here?\" will help corporate leaders understand the culture and representation they've created for their employees, enabling them to better tackle their DEI goals. \u2022 Corporate Partnerships And Pledges: Bringing Fortune 500 brands and bigger corporations into this conversation can immensely impact DEI growth and people representation. Furthermore, enforcing commitments like the Women in Cloud Pledge , which is focused on enabling equitable opportunities for women technology entrepreneurs, moves the needle further in the right direction. \u2022 Community Engagement: The power of the people should never be doubted. Building communities within the organization or integrating leadership into communities helps employees and partners understand DEI initiatives better, enables honest conversations and fosters a community that drives change in the industry. People will continue to be the focus. People are at the center of everything in this world. As people build more technologically advanced sustainable societies, DEI will grow in importance. And people's representation will become increasingly essential as Millennials and Gen-Z continue to dominate the workforce. In fact, Millennials are expected to make up 75% of the workforce by 2025 . So, regardless of whether you're ready, DEI is soon going to be an integral part of every organization. Organizations that focus on implementing DEI with people in the center will stay ahead in the long run while delivering sustainable growth.

    "full_description": "Rocket launches can inject huge amounts of soot into higher layers of Earth's atmosphere, depending on their fuel, possibly contributing to climate change. A pair of British rocket startups now claim their rocket technology can reduce spaceflight's environmental footprint by switching to renewable fuel. Both of these startups plan to launch their rockets from different spaceports located in Scottish wilderness , and being green has been part of their pitch from the start. While Edinburgh-based Skyrora plans to fly their rockets using rocket fuel made from non-recyclable plastics. Their counterpart, the Inverness-based Orbex , is betting on biopropane, a natural gas made as a byproduct during biodiesel production. Last week, Orbex released a study by experts from the University of Exeter in the U.K., which claims that the company's bio-propane-powered rocket Prime, a micro-launcher, will produce 86% less emissions than a similar-sized fossil fuel launcher. The comparison was made with launchers that burn RP-1, or Rocket Propellant 1, a refined form of aviation fuel kerosene. RP-1 is widely used by rocket builders all over the world. SpaceX 's Falcon 9 uses this fuel in both of its stages. The fossil fuel also powers Russia's workhorse Soyuz rockets and the first stages of America's Atlas V . Related: The rise of space tourism could affect Earth's climate in unforeseen ways, scientists worry Most of the carbon dioxide emissions reductions achieved by Orbex come from the negative carbon footprint of the biofuel production rather than by the launcher emitting considerably less, according to the report's executive summary. The company that supplies the biopropane, U.K.-based Calor, makes the fuel from a mixture of waste residues and \"sustainably sourced materials\", according to Calor's website . However, most experts are not that concerned with the carbon dioxide emissions of spaceflight, simply because there are currently not that many rocket launches. In an earlier interview this year, Martin Ross, of the U.S. Aerospace Corporation, a leading expert on atmospheric effects of rocket launches, told Space.com that the space industry burns only about 1% of the fossil fuel consumed by aviation. There is another component of rocket exhaust that climate experts are concerned about: soot. Rockets inject huge amounts of it into the otherwise pristine upper layers of Earth's atmosphere , where it could trigger possibly far-reaching changes. And here, technology such as Orbex's biopropane-fueled Prime rocket could make a difference. The University of Exeter study says that the Prime vehicle, which is 62 feet (19 meters) long and designed to carry small payloads of up to 330 lbs. (150 kilograms ) to low Earth orbit, will emit much less soot than a similar micro-launcher using RP-1. The company added in a statement that Prime \"almost entirely eliminates\" soot emissions. Soot in the atmosphere can absorb heat and affect the temperature of the higher layers of the atmosphere \u2014 the mesosphere and the stratosphere. Orbex said in its statement that 120 rocket launches emit as much soot as the entire global aviation industry emits in a year. Overall, a single Orbex rocket launch will generate a total of 15 tons (13.8 tonnes) of greenhouse gas emissions, which is equivalent to the annual carbon footprint of an average U.K. citizen, Orbex said in the statement. Related: In photos: First look inside Orbex's Scotland rocket factory Orbex expects to fly its reusable 3D-printed Prime rocket for the first time next year from the Space Hub Sutherland on the northern coast of Scotland. The spaceport recently received planning permission after winning a court case against a billionaire landowner who questioned its environmental impact. Orbex's counterpart Skyrora hasn't launched its three-stage Skyrora XL orbital rocket yet either but has performed several successful test flights of their sub-orbital missile Skylark Micro, which reached the altitude of up to 17 miles (27 kilometers). In 2020, the company tested a small prototype of its engine, which runs on fuel made from non-recyclable plastics. According to the company's website, the new fuel, called Ecosene, showed a 1- 3% better energy profile compared to RP-1. Derek Harris, CEO of Skyrora's Ecosene division, told Space.com that Ecosene comes much cheaper than RP-1, at about $2 per gallon. \"The plastics that we are using actually come from waste disposal,\" Harris said. \"We even get paid to take it, so feedstock is a negative value.\" \u2014 SpaceX's most-flown Falcon 9 rocket is a sooty veteran after 10 launches and landings (photos) \u2014 3D-printed rocket engines: The technology driving the private sector space race \u2014 Startup bluShift Aerospace launches its 1st commercial biofuel rocket from Maine Harris said the company's experiments show the Ecosine-fuelled rocket engine, which uses hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizer to burn with the fuel, produces about 40% less emissions overall, including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, soot and sulfur. Harris said the company hopes to fly its rocket prototype in late 2022 from a spaceport on the Shetland Islands north off the coast of Scotland. Orbex and Skyrora are not the only ones pursuing biofuel. In February this year, American start-up bluShift Aerospace flew its first stage rocket prototype Stardust 1.0, which uses proprietary solid biofuel made from agricultural waste. The test rocket reached less than one mile in altitude. Follow Tereza Pultarova on Twitter @TerezaPultarova . Follow us on Twitter @Spacedotcom and on Facebook .",

    "full_description": "With Winter coming, air pollution in India is going to once again hit crisis levels soon. At the individual level we can wear masks and use air purifiers in our homes, but more broadly, cities and municipalities have also been installing outdoor air purifiers over several years now \u2014 but do these actually work? Have smog towers and outdoor air purifiers made an impact on the air quality in India? Despite the outdoor air purifiers and smog towers, the PM2.5 concentration in India air is currently 5.2 times above the WHO annual air quality guideline. The air quality in India is simply not getting better even after all the money and efforts spent to curb the air pollution problem in the country. We talked to a number of experts to try and understand why this is, and whether there are any better solutions possible. Cities like Mumbai have been deploying Wind Augmentation Purifying Unit (WAYU) since 2015, in an effort to cut down the air pollution problem in India. Major Indian cities like Delhi and Bengaluru have also resorted to installing outdoor purifiers and smog towers along the city roads in an effort to curb pollution problems. Delhi got a new smog tower in Connaught Place in August this year. Yet, India stood third in a list of top ten countries that had the worst air quality in 2020, coming only behind Bangladesh and Pakistan. According to research by the Council on Energy, Environment, and Water (CEEW) \u2014 a Delhi-based policy research institute \u2014 Delhi's air quality in winter 2020 was worse than winter 2019 despite the lockdown. The study also found out that Delhi residents were exposed to air that does not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (60 \u00b5g/m3) for more than half of 2020 despite low economic activity levels for close to eight months (March to November) due to the pandemic-induced lockdown. According to Tanushree Ganguly, an air quality researcher from CEEW, the air pollution that India is facing is an urban infrastructure problem. \u201cIf there is an unpaved road, it is bound to have more dust,\u201d Ganguly said. \u201cVehicular pollution also results in air pollution. In winters, a significant amount of pollution also comes from biomass that people burn for their heating requirements.\u201d WAYU devices, jointly developed by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), and Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) have been around since 2015. The Central Pollution Control Board had installed WAYU units across some major locations in Delhi in 2018. \u201cIts creators claim it can reduce pollution at busy traffic junctions by 40-60 percent,\" Dr. Prashant Gargava, member secretary of the Central Pollution Control Board, had said at the time of installation. \u201cThe air pollution levels change depending on the time it was measured,\u201d Ganguly said. \u201cSo when was it measured, in what area is the air quality being improved \u2014 is it just within ten metres of the air purifiers or within 500 metres of the air purifier \u2014 all these factors need to be considered to show that it is really making any impact. I have not come across any publicly available research or database which clearly says that WAYU devices have actually impacted air quality in the 500 metre radius.\u201d \u201cThere is a constant dynamism in the system and you are not just trying to address sources of pollution which are present at the moment; you are also trying to address the sources which are outside the city,\u201d she added. \u201cI'm not sure how these filters are able to cater to these varying dynamics outdoors. I think the idea is to have credible evidence on their impact before we go ahead and have them across the city.\u201d Vivel Chattopadhyay, Senior Programme Manager of the Clean Air Programme at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a research and advocacy organisation based in Delhi said that apart from the installation costs, outdoor air purifiers come with several added costs. This includes the cost of maintenance, cost of the filters which will have to be changed periodically, components like sensors which require periodic calibration, operational costs, manpower, the cost of the land which is being occupied by the air pollutants and more. These are not easy to solve problems, but the companies making these solutions are also aware of them and working on solutions. \u201cWe have nano-filters in our outdoor air purifiers which can be reused up to four times, thus saving a lot of maintenance costs, \u201c said Rajeev Krishna, founder of ATechTron, a product development company based in Bengaluru. ATechTron have installed their outdoor air purifiers in locations including Marathahalli junction, Whitefield, and PR Nagar in Bengaluru. CEEW had suggested in their research that Delhi needs a dedicated air quality forecasting cell to facilitate the rollout of preventive measures. \u201cIf we have the forecast for the next 72 hours, we can clearly see the contribution ratio to the pollution \u2014 for example, urban dust at night is the highest,\u201d said Ganguly. \u201cPerhaps, this is due to the trucks at night. The government can take measures to cut out the activities which they really can through forecasting \u2014 it's very difficult to execute these activities due to the significant economic repercussions.\u201d \u201cWherever in the world where pollution reduction has happened in a big manner, the solution has been cleaner fuel and technology working to controlling pollution from the sources, better assessment and study of where the pollution is coming from,\u201d said Chattopadhyay. Chattopadhyay added that the amount of money that is being spent on outdoor air purifiers can be used to cut down the emission from the sources. \u201cThe same amount of money can be spent to buy electric buses, you can have waste collection and segregation centres. That will eliminate the source of the problems. That will give us better long term gains. Outdoor air purifiers are really futile efforts. Government is letting the pollution be released from the source. The emissions are taking place from industry, from vehicles, and multiple sources. Cutting down from the source will have a wider implication in terms of exposure too,\u201d added Chattopadhyay. Ganguly also suggested that the transit infrastructure, including waste collection, waste transport, and waste management infrastructure need to be improved. \u201cIn winters, a significant amount of pollution also comes from biomass that people burn for their heating requirements,\u201d she noted. \u201cThe Delhi shelters are perhaps not able to cater to all the homeless people in Delhi. So I think it is also important how the government is planning on upgrading these existing shelters, so that at least their utilisation is better. At night, if these shelters can accommodate the homeless population, then their reliance on garbage or dry leaves for their heating requirements could be reduced.\u201d Chattopadhyay also added that tighter emission control norms must be in place. \u201cTighter emission control norms for power plants will lead to a reduction (in air pollution). The government has to put in the money into the right sources \u2014 cutting emissions from the sources and maintaining regulations. Smog towers are not a right policy decision. Such methods give a signal to the polluters that it is okay to pollute,\u201d he said. Krishna, of ATechTron, disagreed with the researchers' suggestions that forecasting and air quality monitoring is a better solution. He suggested that strategically placing outdoor air purifiers within a distance of two-three kilometres to each other throughout the city will surely lead to a reduction in air pollution. Angad Daryani, founder of Praan, a deep tech startup which makes outdoor air purifiers also said that what the NCR government is doing with smog-free towers is non-scientific. When asked if outdoor air purifiers can really contribute to solving the pollution problem in India, he said that the outdoor air purifiers from Praan serve as a bandage solution to the pollution problem while we transition to cleaner energy. I asked Ganguly if this was the case, but she remained unconvinced. \u201cLet's not call it a solution before we know for sure it is one,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce the entire range of measures has been taken and if we still don't see any significant impact, then perhaps this could be looked at as a solution. But this cannot precede all the other solutions. As a researcher, that is what I have an issue with.\u201d .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

Like them or not, they\u2019re a convenient way to keep from convening at the office. While the commute might be improved, the increased amount of distractions we experience at home can severely diminish the quality of our interactions. The unwanted sounds picked up by the sensitive microphone in your computer can interfere with hearing crucial information during important calls. Changing your setup or improving your hardware can certainly help reduce some interference. But if you really want to reduce all background noise, your best bet is to use a software application like Krisp. You\u2019ll get better results without having to use filters or upgrading to a better microphone. Krisp also works with all microphones and headphones, harnessing the power of AI to recognize and remove unwanted sounds. Powered by Deep Neural Networks Krisp\u2019s AI-based noise reduction technology will cut out any background noise from your meetings, video chats, online courses and conference calls \u2014 leaving only the human voice discernible. The background noise from other participants can also be removed during calls, so you\u2019ll no longer need to ask anyone to \u201cmute themselves,\u201d which always sounds a bit rude. Krisp technology is based on deep neural networks and is trained using thousands of hours of audio. Its bi-directional noise removal takes away noise from both the microphone and the speaker. Additionally, Krisp removes the acoustic echo that can occur from your own voice, as well as removing room echo, which can resonate from walls of empty rooms during calls. Adding this protective layer to your microphone, Krisp delivers clean-sounding audio and HD voice quality. Sounding like you\u2019re speaking from a submarine below sea level will be a thing of the past, as will be any distortion. Say Goodbye to Distractions Whether you\u2019re an entrepreneur, salesperson, or consultant, this one simple application can help limit your distractions and keep them from hijacking your focus during important calls. For some uncanny reason, the gardeners next door seem to have impeccable timing for starting their work during video chats or, worse, an already stressful interview. If you don\u2019t have this issue, then maybe it\u2019s a baby crying, a dog barking, the roof being replaced, or traffic outside your window. Perhaps woodworking is your neighbor\u2019s hobby? Inside the house, we contend with the vacuum cleaner, washing machine, and dishwasher, along with the fan and air-conditioner on a hot day. Even someone clicking away at their keyboard can be bothersome when trying to concentrate. Limiting all these distractions, and more, for both you and your clients will help you conduct more productive meetings and focus on what\u2019s really important. Seamless Integration Krisp works with any wired or wireless microphone, speaker, headset, and headphones. It seamlessly integrates with any communication and recording app that includes audio and microphone settings, like Microsoft Teams, Slack, Zoom, and around 800 others. With Krisp, it\u2019s easy to record the audio of your meetings at any time and share them with your colleagues. You\u2019ll find other software on the market with similar functions that edit out ambient noises from recordings, like Audacity, GarageBand, Wavosaur, and Wavepad. Krisp, however, actually blocks ambient noises from entering the recording, providing studio-like audio quality in real-time during your meetings and calls. Recognized Industry-Favorite Krisp\u2019s enhanced security features protect your data with maximum privacy.

    "full_description": "Former Facebook data scientist turned whistleblower Frances Haugen plans to answer questions Monday from lawmakers in the United Kingdom who are working on legislation to rein in the power of social media companies. Haugen is set to appear before a parliamentary committee scrutinizing the British government\u2019s draft legislation to crack down on harmful online content, and her comments could help lawmakers beef up the new rules. She\u2019s testifying the same day Facebook is expected to release its latest earnings. It will be her second appearance before lawmakers after she testified in the US Senate earlier this month about the danger she says the company poses, from harming children to inciting political violence and fueling misinformation. Haugen cited internal research documents she secretly copied before leaving her job in Facebook\u2019s civic integrity unit. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png She told US lawmakers that she thinks a federal regulator is needed to oversee digital giants like Facebook, something that officials in Britain and the European Union are already working on. The UK government\u2019s online safety bill calls for setting up a regulator that would hold companies to account when it comes to removing harmful or illegal content from their platforms, such as terrorist material or child sex abuse images. \u201cThis is quite a big moment,\u201d Damian Collins, the lawmaker who chairs the committee, said ahead of the hearing. \u201cThis is a moment, sort of like Cambridge Analytica, but possibly bigger in that I think it provides a real window into the soul of these companies.\u201d Collins was referring to the 2018 debacle involving data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica, which gathered details on as many as 87 million Facebook users without their permission. Haugen also is scheduled to meet next month with European Union officials in Brussels, where the bloc\u2019s executive commission is updating its digital rulebook to better protect internet users by holding online companies more responsible for illegal or dangerous content. Under the UK rules, expected to take effect next year, Silicon Valley giants face an ultimate penalty of up to 10% of their global revenue for any violations. The EU is proposing a similar penalty. The UK committee will be hoping to hear more from Haugen about the data that tech companies have gathered. Collins said the internal files that Haugen has turned over to U.S. authorities are important because it shows the kind of information that Facebook holds \u2013 and what regulators should be asking when they investigate these companies. The committee has already heard from another Facebook whistleblower, Sophie Zhang, who raised the alarm after finding evidence of online political manipulation in countries such as Honduras and Azerbaijan before she was fired.",

    "full_description": "The Indianapolis Motor Speedway saw a different kind of race car take to the track this past weekend. University of Waterloo students Brian Mao and Ben Zhang were part of a team that competed in the Indy Autonomous Challenge on Saturday for a $1 million U.S. top prize. The challenge: to advance and push autonomous vehicle technology to the next level. \"And what better way to do that than to push the limits and drive at speeds much faster than any regular car,\" Mao told CBC News from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. \"That would force control design or path finder algorithms to be that much more robust, that much more accurate and that much more competitively efficient.\" Mao and Zhang teamed up with students from schools like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Pittsburgh and the Rochester Institute of Technology. There were nine other teams from around the globe taking part in the race, each tasked with modifying a Dallara AV-21 race car. This is the racecar University of Waterloo students Ben Zhang and Brian Mao helped build. All teams were given the same hardware for the cars, but had to create their own software to make them race. (Submitted by: Ben Zhang and Brian Mao/Indy Autonomous Challenge) \"We make minor tweaks on where to place the ethernet cables and what hardware we decide to use as the interface between the computer and the car,\" explained Zhang, who is a master's student in electrical and computer engineering. \"What distinguishes each team is the software stack that's running behind the car, what algorithms are you using for each part that's required to achieve a fully autonomous vehicle,\" Mao added, who is a master's student in applied mathematics. Zhang said the driver's seat was replaced with a computer system that is made up of different sensors and radars and cameras to allow the the vehicle to drive autonomously. The price tag on Zhang's and Mao's team race car was about $1 million US, and it had the ability to top speeds of up to 200 km/h. Brian Mao, front, talks with his teammates during a practice session at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway ahead of the Indy Autonomous Challenge. (Submitted by: Ben Zhang and Brian Mao/Indy Autonomous Challenge) 'Feels amazing' The competition was fierce, however. Zhang said other teams have dedicated research labs for this project and more time. But Zhang and Mao said a great asset to their team is the diversity of engineering, computer and mathematics background. \"We have all sorts of different ideas that could blend together,\" Mao said. \"The diversity is what distinguishes us.\" Mao and Zhang said after pouring many hours working and practicing with a simulator for this race, actually setting foot on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway,\"feels amazing.\" 'It's the future of the sport': Local racer chases dream in electric car Video Windsor home to virtual model of Project Arrow concept vehicle \"Seeing the real thing, in person, is completely different. This arena is huge. The videos do not do it justice,\" Mao said. \"It's such a fulfilling experience seeing a physical car drive around in front of your own eyes rather than just a bunch of pixels on a simulation.\" Zhang said after the race wraps up on Saturday, he plans on taking a short break before he tackles other projects they have in the works. Mao said he is hoping to persue a career in autonomous vehicles. On Sunday, a team spokesperson told CBC News that the car was unable to finish the race due to a GPS issue that resulted in it crashing. The TUM Autonomous Motorsport from the Technical University of Munich won the challenge on Saturday and claimed the grand prize of one million dollars.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin AFP via Getty Images Facebook\u2019s had a rough few weeks. And it\u2019s only likely to get worse for the trillion-dollar company over the next couple of days. The social media company will report third-quarter earnings Monday after the market closes, and it has already warned that changes to Apple\u2019s privacy settings is impacting its ads business, hurting sales. (Apple in April began to allow iOS users to block apps from tracking them. Facebook and many other Big Tech firms relied on collecting such user data to fuel advertising revenue .) In addition to Facebook\u2019s previous red flares, Snap on Thursday narrowly missed expectations around its revenue\u2014by no more than $3 million\u2014and cited Apple as a core problem. Snap investors panicked, and shares sank almost as much as 30%, prompting a drop in Facebook and other tech stocks. For the third quarter, analysts have forecast Facebook bringing in $29.6 billion in sales on $3.2 billion in profit. And just as it must fess up to possibly lackluster sales figures, the company is fully engulfed in an ever-widening scandal, the worst it has experienced in several years. Earlier this month, whistle-blower Frances Haugen went public with Congressional testimony and leaked internal documents showing Facebook struggle to contain misinformation and other harmful content on its apps\u2014despite extensive research from its employees about the problems. The Wall Street Journal published the first reports using Haugen\u2019s documents. She has since made the documents available to a small group of other news organizations, and those outlets published additional reports over the weekend. Those stories documented Facebook\u2019s role in the Jan. 6 riots and decision to wade into foreign markets like India with perilous consequences, among other things. In response to the crisis, Facebook has responded with an aggressive public-relations campaign to discredit Haugen and the documents at the center of the media coverage. The company reportedly hopes to further distance itself from the past by changing its name , perhaps to align with a new focus on augmented- and virtual-reality technology. The rechristening could come during Facebook\u2019s Connect conference on Thursday, a summit devoted to those VR plans.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Four phases of growth in analytics tech getty Many years ago, I went looking for some \u201cdesktop AI\u201d\u2014artificial intelligence that would allow me to tease out trends in data. I knew about IBM\u2019s Watson , so I went to the website in hopes of uploading data and getting access to some machine learning. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works,\u201d a friend who worked at IBM told me at the time. \u201cYou can\u2019t just press a button and get AI.\u201d That\u2019s not the case anymore. Today, AI tools and workbenches allow you to click your way to some pretty advanced modeling techniques, without requiring any knowledge of coding or programming language. That\u2019s certainly not to imply that everyone can be a data scientist. But business professionals today can have AI at their fingertips for making data-based projections. Sometimes, it\u2019s as simple as clicking a button that says \u201cpredictor.\u201d To put this in perspective, let\u2019s examine the four phases of data analytics technology for the businessperson\u2014three that brought us to this point, and then what lies ahead. Phase One \u2013 Simple Data Management For years, businesses have been organizing information on spreadsheets\u2014most notably Excel\u2014to run analyses, such as summary statistics by group. Of course, to get value out of the tool, the user needed to understand the output; otherwise, the exercise was meaningless\u2014and potentially dangerous when making decisions based on something not fully known or understood. MORE FOR YOU Remote, Hybrid Or In-Office: 3 Workforce Considerations For CFOs 10 Open Questions For The 40 Trillion-Dollar ESG Industry The ESG Reporting Endgame: Lessons From Human Capital Reporting For example, back in the spreadsheet days, a data analyst might have compared customer purchasing behaviors across different groups or segments. Let\u2019s say the analysis showed higher average purchasing among Segment 1 than Segment 2, which led to the conclusion that Segment 1 customers were more important to the business. A slightly deeper analysis of variability might reveal that Segment 2 customers were actually more consistent purchasers. That is, a better understanding of what the tool could produce yielded a more effective use of the tool. While the spreadsheet was a great start for the everyday business professional\u2019s analytic needs, it could be a blunt tool without the necessary nuances for deeper insights. Phase Two \u2013 Powerful, But Inaccessible Tools The next phase brought advanced AI technology for analyzing data into the business world mainstream. But until a few years ago, the most powerful AI analysis was limited to only the programmers and developers who built models with code. If someone wanted to compare 10 different models to see which one was most effective at predicting an outcome, it would be necessary to write code for 10 different models. Phase 3 \u2013 Powerful, Accessible AI Workbenches Today\u2019s new consumer-facing tech tools combine powerful algorithms with great user interfaces. Unlike the Phase 2 tools, AI workbenches no longer require knowledge of coding to build many AI models. Additionally, the best AI workbenches easily run many models simultaneously and identify the best model for the data. What remains unchanged from the earliest days of simple data management, however, is the importance of understanding the outcome. When an algorithm produces a result, there are right and wrong, simple and nuanced, ways of using that result. Returning to the example of the customer segments, if an AI model indicates that a certain customer segment is likely to increase in value, humans still need to decide what to do about it. Should they engage more with these customers to ensure a good outcome occurs; or keep the status quo because these customers are likely to lead to a good outcome on their own? In other words, it takes human expertise, while AI provides valuable inputs to supplement that expertise. I recently saw this in action as I watched a business team making decisions of how to deploy sales team talent and resources in the coming year. Without any formal data science training, the team had built an AI-generated graphic that predicted with high accuracy the purchasing behaviors of AI-defined customer segments. Five years ago, this same team would have needed an expensive external data analytics resource to tackle this project. But more likely, they would never have thought about building a predictive model in the first place. Today, though, this analysis is part of how they do business. A recent Harvard Business Review article stated that the digital transformation that has emerged from the Covid pandemic has shown the importance of data analytics and AI for business leaders. It cited a recent survey by The AI Journal that found 72% of business leaders believe AI will play a positive role in the future. The question, then, is what the future of consumer-facing AI tools will look like. Phase 4 \u2013 The Next Frontier of Analytics Tech As we look ahead, a new frontier of productivity is emerging as analytics insights are integrated into everyday business processes and workflows. Currently, common \u201cdesktop AI\u201d tools can show how various factors relate to outcomes; therefore, it would not be a heavy computational lift to take the next step and use those relationships to prescribe some optimal mix of inputs. To be clear, I don\u2019t just want to see what\u2019s behind the models (that is, \u201cglass box AI\u201d); I want the model to show me the optimal mix of inputs for all potential outcomes, and to tie that to the benefits of being right and the costs of being wrong for my specific decision. My wish list for the future would also include improvements in the integration of data. Increasingly, AI is getting better with relevant external data. This seems to indicate a future market boom around AI\u2019s ability to identify valuable external datasets, and easily integrate and configure them. From there, it\u2019s natural to imagine a suite of decision-making tools that can be truly customized, putting the power of AI tools at business professionals\u2019 fingertips. This won\u2019t turn them into data scientists, nor will it dilute the value of professional data scientists. However, more seamless integration of AI into everyday business will increase its value and usability, provided that the outcomes are well understood.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin CEO at Fabric , a headless commerce platform focused on The End of Replatforming\u2122. Previously COO at Wing, Google, Staples, and Amazon. Getty The concept of commerce as a \"platform of platforms\" stems from the need to provide a platform of internet-level commerce services to support trade on any other platform. With a commerce platform-as-a-service (PaaS), companies can focus on expanding their core IP and building differentiating features instead of building commerce services such as product management, order management, shopping cart and checkout. Popular examples of platforms of platforms that deliver internet-level services in areas outside of commerce are AWS, Okta and Stripe. With these platforms, companies can focus on their core IP instead of managing technical infrastructure and services. Through AWS, Amazon offers infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) for computing, storage and networking, while Okta offers identity-as-a-service (IDaaS) that companies use to offer simple and secure sign-on. The Stripe platform is a payment service that plugs into other platforms like Shopify , so Shopify and small businesses using the platform can accept payments. (My company also uses Stripe to power the payment product within our commerce platform, making Stripe a payment platform of platforms for us.) The point is: You don't build a payment gateway to start accepting payments, just like you don't build a commerce platform to start conducting trade. Instead, you plug into a platform of platforms to perform essential activities that are not unique to your business. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event In addition to being convenient, a platform of platforms is also flexible. Services can be used independently and plugged into any business model. Further, companies using the services don't have to manage the underlying infrastructure as this is managed by the platform. But, until recently, there has been no platform of commerce services like there has been a platform for web services, identity services and payment services. Why The Commerce Platform Of Platforms Got Missed Commerce as a domain in this platform of platforms paradigm got missed because building a platform of platforms is hard. Consider Stripe, a company that started in 2009 and has just started gaining major traction. The platform did not evolve over the course of a couple of years; it took over a decade's worth of work from visionaries and engineering talent that believed in that vision. Compare Stripe that focuses strictly on payments with a commerce platform that must focus on product management, inventory management, pricing, promotions, subscriptions, loyalty and customer experience. This is a significant undertaking that many software providers only take on pieces of. A few examples include Salsify for product management, ReCharge for subscriptions and Bloomreach for experience. To date, companies have had to use third-party services like this alongside custom-built services and monolithic platforms. Take Roblox, an online game platform that achieves monetization by letting users create and sell games to other users. When it launched in 2005, there were third-party e-commerce platforms available but they were not platforms of platforms; they were monolithic platforms and not flexible and adaptable to cutting-edge business cases like their own. Just like they needed the AWS platform to support internet infrastructure , Roblox needed a commerce platform to support commerce infrastructure. They developed a homegrown e-commerce platform , but other companies might rather focus on other lines of business than to divert resources to develop their own. Even if Roblox had wanted to look elsewhere, no service provider was up to the challenge \u2014 but this is starting to change. There is now demand for a commerce platform of platforms, much like there was demand for a web services platform of platforms when AWS launched its IT infrastructure services in 2006. New Commerce Platforms Are Starting to Emerge New commerce software platforms and initiatives have appeared over the past few years (including my own) attempting to build scalable commerce services. The issue is that many are too focused on the headless commerce trend and missing out on the big picture. Headless commerce directs the front-end customer experience, but not internet-level services, which is what's needed as 77% of software engineers , including those at Roblox, move to service-oriented software architectures . To fill the commerce platform of platforms gap and support a variety of use cases, a platform must be both headless and modular (i.e., service-oriented). In addition to supporting common use cases for D2C, B2C and B2B commerce, a platform must support emerging use cases on gaming platforms, digital publishing platforms and consumer-to-consumer (C2C) platforms . In short, the commerce platform of platforms must be agnostic to the desired use case or business model. In addition to meeting requirements for flexibility, the platform must also scale. For example, with traditional commerce platforms, open-source e-commerce software and custom-built e-commerce solutions, large enterprises and high-growth brands must plan months in advance to support holiday shopping that occurs online. And, even after this planning, e-commerce sites from Costco, Home Depot, H&M and Nordstrom Rack still go down , costing up to $11 million in sales. With cloud-native services that a true commerce platform of platforms is composed of, scalability should no longer be an issue, leaving time for developers and engineers to build business-differentiating features, not e-commerce infrastructure. Identifying a Scalable Commerce Platform Overall, this is a very new space with many new entrants, and choosing a commerce platform of platforms could quickly get confusing. A simple way to test a platform is to answer these questions: 1. Is it flexible? Determine whether the platform exposes APIs that enable unrestricted customization on the front end without relying on a rigid, monolithic back end (i.e., headless commerce). 2. Is it service-oriented? Determine whether the PIM, OMS and other commerce software are separated into distinct modules, which are further separated into services or APIs (i.e., modular commerce). 3. Is it scalable? Determine whether the platform is cloud-native to streamline DevOps and customizable through configuration rather than code to streamline feature development. Choosing a commerce platform that checks these boxes will serve you well as you build new e-commerce features, expand existing features or migrate from legacy commerce technology.

    "description": "A roundup of the best electric bikes from all disciplines of pedal-powered cycling",
    "content": "When you're looking to invest in one of the best electric bikes you can buy, the amount of choice out there can be daunting. Gone are the days when e-bikes were a rare novelty and only a small handful of household name brands actually sold them. Nowadays almost every brand you can think of is gunning for a slice of the pedal-assisted pie, and you can choose from a veritable smorgasbord of options. For example, if you need something you can carry upstairs or hoick over fences, you should check out the best lightweight electric bikes. Meanwhile if you're shopping on a budget you can find something in your price range by perusing the best electric bikes under \u00a31,000 / $1,000, or the best electric bike under $2,000 / \u00a32,000 if you have a bit more to spend. Finally, if you're not ready to invest in a new bike altogether, consider the best electric bike conversion kits to breathe new life into an old bike and give it a much-needed boost.To help you narrow down your choices and find the right electric bike for your needs, we've rounded up our top picks of the best e-road bikes, e-hybrid bikes and e-mountain bikes, exploring their pros and cons and deconstructing all that marketing jargon you're no doubt encountering wherever you look.Read on for our picks of the best electric bikes you can buy today, or jump ahead to find out how to choose the best electric bike for you. Best electric road bikes (Image credit: Courtesy) Specialized Turbo Creo SL ExpertOne of the lightest electric bikes you can buyDrive System: Specialized SL 1.1 | Battery capacity: 480Wh | Claimed weight: 12kg | Price: \u00a37,499.00 / $9,000.00 / \u20ac8,499.00 / AU$12,000.00Lightweight Mission control app Future ShockBattery not removable from the frame Specialized\u2019s Turbo Creo SL looks almost identical to a standard road bike, and thanks to the nifty SL1.1 drive system it isn't all that much heavier. Specialized worked with Brose to design its own motor, which is claimed to weigh just 1.96kg and produce 240watts of assistance. Integrated into the downtube is a 320Wh battery, which is said to weigh 1.8kg, and Specialized makes a 60Wh range extender that fits into a bottle cage should you be headed out for an epic adventure. Specialized has integrated its e-bike system with the Mission Control App, which allows you to run diagnostics and customize how much pedal assist is on offer.The Turbo Creo SL Expert is the brand's second-tier model and sees a Fact11 carbon frame and the Future Shock 2.0 with tunable dampening. The frame uses thru-axles front and rear and sees Shimano Deore XT Di2/Ultegra Di2 drivetrain with an 11-42- cassette. (Image credit: Courtesy) Trek Domane + LTEndurance assisted platform with premium comfortDrive System: Fazua | Battery capacity: 250Wh | Claimed weight: 14.7kg | Price: \u00a36,000.00 / $6,499.00 / \u20ac6,099.00 / AU$9,299.00Isospeed front and rear Stable handling Resistance free pedalingHeavy For 2021 Trek\u2019s Domane LT platform takes almost everything we love about the Trek\u2019s endurance road bike and gives you a bit of extra oomph to get you up and climb. The frame is made from 500 Series OCLV carbon, features the brand\u2019s IsoSpeed decoupler, clearance for up to 38c tires, and sees a nearly identical geometry to the non assisted version. Using a Fauza drive system, the motor can output 250w and is powered by a 250w removable battery stored in the downtube, which means you don\u2019t have to charge your entire bike, but also that it can be replaced as the battery degrades over time.The Domane + LT sees almost all the bells and whistles the non-pedal-assist version offers including the dual IsoSpeed decouplers although it doesn't get the downtube storage as that is where the battery is stored. (Image credit: Bianchi) Bianchi E-ImpulsoThe best looking of the bunchDrive System: Ebikemotion X35+ | Battery capacity: 250Wh | Claimed weight: TBC | Price: \u00a34,599.99 / $4,240.00 / \u20ac4,335.00 / AU$6,550.00Nearly indistinguishable from the standard bikeBattery is fixed inside the downtube The Bianchi e-Impulso takes advantage of the Ebikemotion drive system and is one of the most stealthy-looking electric bikes on the market. The power button on the top tube gives the game away; the 250Wh battery is hidden inside the downtube, and the rear hub-based motor provides up to 40Nm of torque at full bore. The aluminium frame is mated with a carbon fork, while the bike sees an 11-speed Ultegra drivetrain, Vision Velomann tubeless-ready wheels finished in 32mm Vittoria rubber, and Velomann finishing kit. It's a road bike at heart, but Bianchi also makes the bike with a gravel-friendly build that will also tackle the rough stuff. Best electric gravel bikes (Image credit: Courtesy) Cannondale Topstone Neo Lefty 3Almost full suspension gravel bike sure to polarize opinionDrive System: Bosch | Battery capacity: 500Wh | Claimed weight: 18kg | Price: \u00a35,600.00 / $6,300.00 / \u20ac6,099.00 / AU$9,799.00Handling and grip Torque Lefty Oliver forkUglyHeavy Cannondale's Topstone Neo is a spiritual descendant on steroids of the veritable Slate. Based on the chassis of the carbon Topstone, the 30mm KingPin pivot based rear suspension is matched with the Lefty Oliver single stanchion fork, offering 30mm of air-spring suspension. The Lefty is a bit of an engineering marvel, and is one of the stiffest forks on the market, and sees hydraulic damping and lockout. Suspension on a gravel bike always induces audible eye-rolls from drop bar purists, but the fact of the matter adds considerable improvements to both comfort and grip. In the middle of the triangles is Bosch\u2019s Performance Line Speed motor and removable 500Wh battery. With up to 250-watts of assistance and 85nm of torque on tap, the Bosch drive unit will help you crawl up that impossibly steep fire road, while a bar-mounted Purion display keeps all the vitals at your fingertips. (Image credit: Courtesy) Ribble CGR AL eBang for your buck Gravel e-bikeDrive System: Ebikemotion | Battery capacity: 250Wh | Claimed weight: 13.6kg | Price: Starting from \u00a32,399.00 / $N/A / \u20ac2,369.41 / AU$N/AAlloy frame Price Rack and fender mountsFixed battery Our favourite thing about Ribble is the way it sells its bikes because the Bikebuilder platform allows you to customise every component from drivetrain to wheels, tyres and touchpoints. The CGR AL e is the brand's alloy eGravel platform. The alloy frame will take both 700x35c or 650bx2in wheels and tyres with mudguards, and sees rack and fender mounts galore.Taking advantage of the eBikemotion system, the motor is a rear hub-based, and the 250Wh battery is integrated into the downtube. This system is lightweight and doesn't change the frame's silhouette, but most of all is friction-free when the motor is not in use. The Ribble CGR AL E is also one of the most affordable eGravel bikes, with an SRAM Apex version going for $2,724 \u2014 there is a less expensive Shimano Tiagra build, but the rear derailleur is not clutched, which is a non-starter for us. (Image credit: Courtesy) Canyon Grail:OnGravel e-bike from the futureDrive System: Bosch | Battery capacity: 250Wh | Claimed weight: 17.1kg | Price: \u00a34,999.00 / $TBC / \u20ac4,999.00 / AU$TBCHoverbar Tyre clearance Drag free pedalingLooks Heavy With room for 50mm tires, the eclectic hover bar, and a Bosch Performance Line CX motor, the Canyon Grail: On eGravel bike is anything but vanilla. Based around the ever successful Grail, the geometry has been tweaked ever so slightly for a more upright riding position. While Canyon\u2019s other drop bar eBikes utilised the sleeker-looking Fauza system, the brand says it opted for the Bosch motors for the additional torque on offer, which is what you need to get up and over those steep techy features. With the new geometry, the wheelbase is a tad longer to increase stability and make room for mudguards and the balloon-like 50mm tires. The Grail: On CF7 sits in the middle of the pricing spectrum and comes equipped with a Shimano GRX drivetrain, an FSA carbon crankset with a 44t chainring at the front and 11-42 cassette out the back Best electric commuter bikes (Image credit: Specialized) Specialized Turbo Vado SL Commuter that comes with all the bells and whistlesDrive System: Specialized SL 1.1 | Battery capacity: 320Wh | Claimed weight: 14.9kg | Price: \u00a33,000.00 / $\u200c3,695.00 / \u20ac3,775.00 / AU$5,705.00Natural ride feelReasonably low weight1x drivetrainRelaxed, upright riding positionIntegrated lightsCan feel underpowered on particularly hilly rides With an upright riding position, robust alloy frame, integrated lights and a lightweight design, the Specialized Turbo Vado SL 4.0 is a great option for the everyday commuter and urban cyclist running errands by bike. The drive system is the brand's own, and sees a 400Wh battery integrated into the frame. The mid-drive drive unit system makes the bike a 1x system, but that simplifies shifting, and coming with the 10-speed 11-42 cassette, can mountain goat up many a city climb. Rolling on 700c wheels, the 38mm Specialized Pathfinder Sport tyres will take the sting out of curbs and potholes. When you need to drop the anchors, Tektro hydraulic disc brakes and 160mm rotors will stop on a dime. (Image credit: Courtesy) Cube Kathmandu Hybrid Pro 625Ideal for carrying heavy gearDrive System: Bosch | Battery capacity: 625Wh | Claimed weight: 25.9kg | Price: \u00a33,099.00 / $TBC / \u20acTBC / AU$TBCIntegrated rackExpandably battery capacityBosch Gen 4 drive unitHeavy Available in standard, drop top tube and step through versions, the Cube Kathmandu Hybrid Pro is a commuter bike built for riders of all shapes and sizes. Using Bosch\u2019s fourth-generation GX drive unit and Cube\u2019s Modular Battery system, the Kathmandu hides the battery behind an easy-access cover on the down tube, which not only protects it from the elements but also leaves space should you want to slot in a bigger cell. Instead of the typical bolt-on racks you find on most commuter bikes; Cube has opted to make the Integrated Carrier 2.0 over the rear wheel a permanent fixture of the bike. This provides a more stable platform for whatever you may be carrying, and makes for a clean, integrated look. At the front, the bike sees a tapered head tube and 100mm SR Suntour fork. The cables are routed internally, and shifting duties are looked after by a Shimano Deore 10-speed drivetrain. (Image credit: Courtesy) Brompton ElectricPedal assisted folderDrive System: Brompton | Battery capacity: 300Wh | Claimed weight: 11.6kg | Price: \u00a33,020.00 / $4,050.00 / \u20ac3,730.00 / AU$N/AWeight Compact & foldableRemovable batteryFront-wheel drive systems can get squirrely Whether you live in a small apartment, using multiple forms of transport on your commute, or your destination doesn\u2019t have secure bike storage, a folding bike might just be your best option. Brompton has long been the gold standard in folding bikes, and its electric version takes the origami bike you know and love, and adds pedal assist. The bike still gets the M-type handlebar, Sturmey Archer wide range gear hub, and even the rear damper to improve ride comfort. Using a 250-watt front hub-based motors and a handlebar-mounted 300Wh removable battery pack, that Brompton says has enough juice for between 30km and 70km, and takes four hours to recharge. What\u2019s most surprising is Brompton says the bike only weighs 11.6kg, which is on par with some non-pedal assist folders Best electric mountain bikes (Image credit: Whyte) Whyte E-150 SA very sweet-handling chariotDrive System: Bosch Performance Line CX | Battery capacity: 625Wh | Claimed weight: TBC | Price: \u00a34,750.00 / \u20ac5,700.00 / $6,000.00 / AU$N/AOutstanding handlingBosch overdrive Shimano componentsBrakes pushed to the limit Our testers over on our sister site Bike Perfect were really impressed by the Whyte E-150 S, finding its handling to be outstanding, thanks to the well-performing Bosch drive system and a great suite of components from Shimano. Its low centre of gravity and balance of agility and stability make it a champion on the turns too.It comes with a 140mm RockShox Deluxe Select + RT shock paired with a 150mm RockShox Yari RC fork, while Shimano's Deore groupset handles the braking and shifting. (Image credit: Orbea) Orbea Rise M20A sleek-looking trail bikeDrive System: Shimano EP8 | Battery capacity: 360Wh | Claimed weight: 16.5kg | Price: \u00a35,600.00 / \u20ac6,300.00 / $7,000.00 / AU$N/AGreat lookNice spec listLightweight for MTBNo Display Looking at the Orbea Rise, it's surprising how much it looks like a regular trail bike. That's thanks to the hidden Shimano EP8 motor, integrated into the lower portion of the frame. Alongside its powerhouse and battery, you get Shimano supplied SLX drivetrain components and M6100 disc brakes.In terms of suspension, the Rise M20 comes equipped with Fox Float Performance suspension, with 140mm in the front and rear. When it comes to e-mountain bikes, the Orbea Rise M20 is undeniably a looker, and could well be the best looking e-MTB on this list. You'll have fun fooling other riders on the trails too, who probably won't spot that you're getting a boost. (Image credit: Courtesy) Trek Rail 7Rides lighter than it isDrive System: Bosch | Battery capacity: 625Wh | Claimed weight: : 23.7kg | Price: \u00a35,500.00 / $6,499.99 / \u20ac5,999.00 / AU$9,499.99RE:aktive suspensionShort chainstays Updated GeometryRIB Battery Trek\u2019s Rail is the successor to the Powerfly eMTB, and it's shorter, lighter, and more powerful. Many of these upgrades are thanks to the new Gen 4 Bosch Performance Line CX drive units, which are more compact, allowing Trek to chop serious yardage out of the chainstays. The battery has also received an upgrade with a 625Wh group stored in the Trek\u2019s Removable Integrated Battery (RIB) side access system. Arguably the most significant advantage to the new Gen 4 motors is they allow for a standard crank and chainring, meaning there is considerably less friction to overcome when the motor is not engaged. With 150mm of travel at the back, the rear shock sees the brands RE:aktiv with thru shaft shock, which allows for improved small bump sensitivity without sacrificing mid-stroke support. To balance out the squish, Trek supplies a 160mm RockShox Lyrik fork. How to choose the best electric bike for you Are there e-bike restrictions? Regardless of whether your electric bike has a Shimano, Bosch, Fauza, or any other drive system, it will be limited to comply with regional laws and restrictions. This will affect the maximum wattage, pedal-assist speed, and the need for licensing and insurance.These vary depending on whereabouts in the world you reside and ride your bike, so here are the key things you need to know about regional restrictions in the UK and US: UKIn the UK, eBikes are classed as regular non-pedal assist bikes provided the motor cuts out a 25kph, does not generate more than 250-watts of assistance, and does not kick in until the bike is already in motion. Riders must also be at least 14-years old. If your bike meets these criteria, you can legally ride it anywhere a bike can be ridden. If your eBike doesn\u2019t meet these standards, it will need to be registered and insured as a motor vehicle, and you will need a license and a helmet. USAThe US is one of the more difficult countries to navigate eBike regulations because the rules will vary depending on what state you live in, and even then, the laws are written in legal-ese that just about require a member of your local bar association to translate.According to federal legislation enacted by congress in 2002, an eBike is defined as, \u201cA two- or three-wheeled vehicle with fully operable pedals and an electric motor of less than 750 watts (1 h.p.), whose maximum speed on a paved level surface, when powered solely by such a motor while ridden by an operator who weighs 170 pounds, is less than 20 mph.\u201dUnfortunately, state laws surrounding eBikes often supersede this legislation. Currently, 33 states have statutes that define an eBike in some manner while the rest lack a specific definition, and may lump them in with another vehicle class. To make things even more confusing, in states like Mississippi there is no mention of eBikes in the wording of the laws, but a general opinion issued by the Attorney General says an electric bicycle should be classified as a regular bike. Thirteen states have taken up the three-tiered system outlined by The Bicycle Product Suppliers Association which divides electric bikes up based on their maximum assisted speed: Class 1: the motor provides assistance only when the rider is pedalling and cuts out a 20mphClass 2: the motor can contribute regardless of pedalling but is governed to 20mphClass 3: the motor provides assistance when the rider is pedalling but cuts out at 28mph and must be equipped with a speedometer. Regardless of class, the motor can only generate a maximum of 750-watts, and the class must be labelled clearly. In the 17 states that lump eBikes in with other classes of vehicles, licensing and registration may be required to operate an eBike. If your head is spinning trying to keep these rules straight, our friends over at People for Bikes have a handy state by state guide. AustraliaAustralians love simplicity and that is why eBikes are split into throttle operated and non-throttle operated. Throttle operated eBikes must be limited to 200-watts and 25kph, while pedal assist can provide up to 250-watts of assistance but is limited to the same speed limit. In keeping with this simplicity, anything that doesn\u2019t abide by the above is considered a motorbike by law, and must be licensed and insured. Which motor and battery do I need? The best e-bike motors can be located in several areas of the bike, depending on which brand and model you opt for, and generally consist of a front-drive, mid-drive or rear-drive motor system, located in the front hub, bottom bracket and rear hub respectively.While any of the three options will serve you fine, the motor system location will often have an impact on the handling of your bike, so it's worth considering whether or not you would have a preference. Generally, a mid-drive motor system is the best of the three, as it spreads the weight more evenly throughout the bike. Since the motor and battery are the heaviest parts, it's better to have that heft closer to the ground and between the wheels, so as not to throw off your centre of gravity.Batteries on the other hand are described in Wh (watt-hours), which takes into account both their output and capacity. The larger the number, the further your battery will take you on a single charge, and the heavier it will be.",

Best electric road bikes (Image credit: Courtesy) Specialized Turbo Creo SL Expert One of the lightest electric bikes you can buy Drive System: Specialized SL 1.1 | Battery capacity: 480Wh | Claimed weight: 12kg | Price: \u00a37,499.00 / $9,000.00 / \u20ac8,499.00 / AU$12,000.00 Check Amazon Visit Site Lightweight Mission control app Future Shock Battery not removable from the frame Specialized\u2019s Turbo Creo SL looks almost identical to a standard road bike, and thanks to the nifty SL1.1 drive system it isn't all that much heavier. Specialized worked with Brose to design its own motor, which is claimed to weigh just 1.96kg and produce 240watts of assistance. Integrated into the downtube is a 320Wh battery, which is said to weigh 1.8kg, and Specialized makes a 60Wh range extender that fits into a bottle cage should you be headed out for an epic adventure. Specialized has integrated its e-bike system with the Mission Control App, which allows you to run diagnostics and customize how much pedal assist is on offer. The Turbo Creo SL Expert is the brand's second-tier model and sees a Fact11 carbon frame and the Future Shock 2.0 with tunable dampening. The frame uses thru-axles front and rear and sees Shimano Deore XT Di2/Ultegra Di2 drivetrain with an 11-42- cassette.

The frame is made from 500 Series OCLV carbon, features the brand\u2019s IsoSpeed decoupler, clearance for up to 38c tires, and sees a nearly identical geometry to the non assisted version. Using a Fauza drive system, the motor can output 250w and is powered by a 250w removable battery stored in the downtube, which means you don\u2019t have to charge your entire bike, but also that it can be replaced as the battery degrades over time. The Domane + LT sees almost all the bells and whistles the non-pedal-assist version offers including the dual IsoSpeed decouplers although it doesn't get the downtube storage as that is where the battery is stored. (Image credit: Bianchi) Bianchi E-Impulso The best looking of the bunch Drive System: Ebikemotion X35+ | Battery capacity: 250Wh | Claimed weight: TBC | Price: \u00a34,599.99 / $4,240.00 / \u20ac4,335.00 / AU$6,550.00 Check Amazon Visit Site Nearly indistinguishable from the standard bike Battery is fixed inside the downtube The Bianchi e-Impulso takes advantage of the Ebikemotion drive system and is one of the most stealthy-looking electric bikes on the market. The power button on the top tube gives the game away; the 250Wh battery is hidden inside the downtube, and the rear hub-based motor provides up to 40Nm of torque at full bore. The aluminium frame is mated with a carbon fork, while the bike sees an 11-speed Ultegra drivetrain, Vision Velomann tubeless-ready wheels finished in 32mm Vittoria rubber, and Velomann finishing kit. It's a road bike at heart, but Bianchi also makes the bike with a gravel-friendly build that will also tackle the rough stuff. Best electric gravel bikes (Image credit: Courtesy) Cannondale Topstone Neo Lefty 3 Almost full suspension gravel bike sure to polarize opinion Drive System: Bosch | Battery capacity: 500Wh | Claimed weight: 18kg | Price: \u00a35,600.00 / $6,300.00 / \u20ac6,099.00 / AU$9,799.00 Check Amazon Visit Site Handling and grip Torque Lefty Oliver fork Ugly Heavy Cannondale's Topstone Neo is a spiritual descendant on steroids of the veritable Slate. Based on the chassis of the carbon Topstone, the 30mm KingPin pivot based rear suspension is matched with the Lefty Oliver single stanchion fork, offering 30mm of air-spring suspension. The Lefty is a bit of an engineering marvel, and is one of the stiffest forks on the market, and sees hydraulic damping and lockout. Suspension on a gravel bike always induces audible eye-rolls from drop bar purists, but the fact of the matter adds considerable improvements to both comfort and grip. In the middle of the triangles is Bosch\u2019s Performance Line Speed motor and removable 500Wh battery. With up to 250-watts of assistance and 85nm of torque on tap, the Bosch drive unit will help you crawl up that impossibly steep fire road, while a bar-mounted Purion display keeps all the vitals at your fingertips. (Image credit: Courtesy) Ribble CGR AL e Bang for your buck Gravel e-bike Drive System: Ebikemotion | Battery capacity: 250Wh | Claimed weight: 13.6kg | Price: Starting from \u00a32,399.00 / $N/A / \u20ac2,369.41 / AU$N/A Check Amazon Visit Site Alloy frame Price Rack and fender mounts Fixed battery Our favourite thing about Ribble is the way it sells its bikes because the Bikebuilder platform allows you to customise every component from drivetrain to wheels, tyres and touchpoints. The CGR AL e is the brand's alloy eGravel platform. The alloy frame will take both 700x35c or 650bx2in wheels and tyres with mudguards , and sees rack and fender mounts galore. Taking advantage of the eBikemotion system, the motor is a rear hub-based, and the 250Wh battery is integrated into the downtube. This system is lightweight and doesn't change the frame's silhouette, but most of all is friction-free when the motor is not in use. The Ribble CGR AL E is also one of the most affordable eGravel bikes, with an SRAM Apex version going for $2,724 \u2014 there is a less expensive Shimano Tiagra build, but the rear derailleur is not clutched, which is a non-starter for us. (Image credit: Courtesy) Canyon Grail:On Gravel e-bike from the future Drive System: Bosch | Battery capacity: 250Wh | Claimed weight: 17.1kg | Price: \u00a34,999.00 / $TBC / \u20ac4,999.00 / AU$TBC Visit Site Hoverbar Tyre clearance Drag free pedaling Looks Heavy With room for 50mm tires, the eclectic hover bar, and a Bosch Performance Line CX motor, the Canyon Grail: On eGravel bike is anything but vanilla. Based around the ever successful Grail, the geometry has been tweaked ever so slightly for a more upright riding position. While Canyon\u2019s other drop bar eBikes utilised the sleeker-looking Fauza system, the brand says it opted for the Bosch motors for the additional torque on offer, which is what you need to get up and over those steep techy features. With the new geometry, the wheelbase is a tad longer to increase stability and make room for mudguards and the balloon-like 50mm tires. The Grail: On CF7 sits in the middle of the pricing spectrum and comes equipped with a Shimano GRX drivetrain, an FSA carbon crankset with a 44t chainring at the front and 11-42 cassette out the back Best electric commuter bikes (Image credit: Specialized) Specialized Turbo Vado SL Commuter that comes with all the bells and whistles Drive System: Specialized SL 1.1 | Battery capacity: 320Wh | Claimed weight: 14.9kg | Price: \u00a33,000.00 / $\u200c3,695.00 / \u20ac3,775.00 / AU$5,705.00 Check Amazon Natural ride feel Reasonably low weight 1x drivetrain Relaxed, upright riding position Integrated lights Can feel underpowered on particularly hilly rides With an upright riding position, robust alloy frame, integrated lights and a lightweight design, the Specialized Turbo Vado SL 4.0 is a great option for the everyday commuter and urban cyclist running errands by bike. The drive system is the brand's own, and sees a 400Wh battery integrated into the frame. The mid-drive drive unit system makes the bike a 1x system, but that simplifies shifting, and coming with the 10-speed 11-42 cassette, can mountain goat up many a city climb. Rolling on 700c wheels, the 38mm Specialized Pathfinder Sport tyres will take the sting out of curbs and potholes. When you need to drop the anchors, Tektro hydraulic disc brakes and 160mm rotors will stop on a dime. (Image credit: Courtesy) Cube Kathmandu Hybrid Pro 625 Ideal for carrying heavy gear Drive System: Bosch | Battery capacity: 625Wh | Claimed weight: 25.9kg | Price: \u00a33,099.00 / $TBC / \u20acTBC / AU$TBC Check Amazon Integrated rack Expandably battery capacity Bosch Gen 4 drive unit Heavy Available in standard, drop top tube and step through versions, the Cube Kathmandu Hybrid Pro is a commuter bike built for riders of all shapes and sizes. Using Bosch\u2019s fourth-generation GX drive unit and Cube\u2019s Modular Battery system, the Kathmandu hides the battery behind an easy-access cover on the down tube, which not only protects it from the elements but also leaves space should you want to slot in a bigger cell. Instead of the typical bolt-on racks you find on most commuter bikes; Cube has opted to make the Integrated Carrier 2.0 over the rear wheel a permanent fixture of the bike. This provides a more stable platform for whatever you may be carrying, and makes for a clean, integrated look. At the front, the bike sees a tapered head tube and 100mm SR Suntour fork. The cables are routed internally, and shifting duties are looked after by a Shimano Deore 10-speed drivetrain. (Image credit: Courtesy) Brompton Electric Pedal assisted folder Drive System: Brompton | Battery capacity: 300Wh | Claimed weight: 11.6kg | Price: \u00a33,020.00 / $4,050.00 / \u20ac3,730.00 / AU$N/A Check Amazon Visit Site Weight Compact & foldable Removable battery Front-wheel drive systems can get squirrely Whether you live in a small apartment, using multiple forms of transport on your commute, or your destination doesn\u2019t have secure bike storage, a folding bike might just be your best option. Brompton has long been the gold standard in folding bikes, and its electric version takes the origami bike you know and love, and adds pedal assist. The bike still gets the M-type handlebar, Sturmey Archer wide range gear hub, and even the rear damper to improve ride comfort. Using a 250-watt front hub-based motors and a handlebar-mounted 300Wh removable battery pack, that Brompton says has enough juice for between 30km and 70km, and takes four hours to recharge. What\u2019s most surprising is Brompton says the bike only weighs 11.6kg, which is on par with some non-pedal assist folders Best electric mountain bikes (Image credit: Whyte) Whyte E-150 S A very sweet-handling chariot Drive System: Bosch Performance Line CX | Battery capacity: 625Wh | Claimed weight: TBC | Price: \u00a34,750.00 / \u20ac5,700.00 / $6,000.00 / AU$N/A Check Amazon Outstanding handling Bosch overdrive Shimano components Brakes pushed to the limit Our testers over on our sister site Bike Perfect were really impressed by the Whyte E-150 S , finding its handling to be outstanding, thanks to the well-performing Bosch drive system and a great suite of components from Shimano. Its low centre of gravity and balance of agility and stability make it a champion on the turns too. It comes with a 140mm RockShox Deluxe Select + RT shock paired with a 150mm RockShox Yari RC fork, while Shimano's Deore groupset handles the braking and shifting. (Image credit: Orbea) Orbea Rise M20 A sleek-looking trail bike Drive System: Shimano EP8 | Battery capacity: 360Wh | Claimed weight: 16.5kg | Price: \u00a35,600.00 / \u20ac6,300.00 / $7,000.00 / AU$N/A Check Amazon Great look Nice spec list Lightweight for MTB No Display Looking at the Orbea Rise, it's surprising how much it looks like a regular trail bike. That's thanks to the hidden Shimano EP8 motor, integrated into the lower portion of the frame. Alongside its powerhouse and battery, you get Shimano supplied SLX drivetrain components and M6100 disc brakes. In terms of suspension, the Rise M20 comes equipped with Fox Float Performance suspension, with 140mm in the front and rear. When it comes to e-mountain bikes, the Orbea Rise M20 is undeniably a looker, and could well be the best looking e-MTB on this list. You'll have fun fooling other riders on the trails too, who probably won't spot that you're getting a boost. (Image credit: Courtesy) Trek Rail 7 Rides lighter than it is Drive System: Bosch | Battery capacity: 625Wh | Claimed weight: : 23.7kg | Price: \u00a35,500.00 / $6,499.99 / \u20ac5,999.00 / AU$9,499.99 Check Amazon Buy from Trek RE:aktive suspension Short chainstays Updated Geometry RIB Battery Trek\u2019s Rail is the successor to the Powerfly eMTB, and it's shorter, lighter, and more powerful. Many of these upgrades are thanks to the new Gen 4 Bosch Performance Line CX drive units, which are more compact, allowing Trek to chop serious yardage out of the chainstays. The battery has also received an upgrade with a 625Wh group stored in the Trek\u2019s Removable Integrated Battery (RIB) side access system. Arguably the most significant advantage to the new Gen 4 motors is they allow for a standard crank and chainring, meaning there is considerably less friction to overcome when the motor is not engaged. With 150mm of travel at the back, the rear shock sees the brands RE:aktiv with thru shaft shock, which allows for improved small bump sensitivity without sacrificing mid-stroke support. To balance out the squish, Trek supplies a 160mm RockShox Lyrik fork. How to choose the best electric bike for you Are there e-bike restrictions? Regardless of whether your electric bike has a Shimano, Bosch, Fauza, or any other drive system, it will be limited to comply with regional laws and restrictions. This will affect the maximum wattage, pedal-assist speed, and the need for licensing and insurance. These vary depending on whereabouts in the world you reside and ride your bike, so here are the key things you need to know about regional restrictions in the UK and US: UK In the UK, eBikes are classed as regular non-pedal assist bikes provided the motor cuts out a 25kph, does not generate more than 250-watts of assistance, and does not kick in until the bike is already in motion. Riders must also be at least 14-years old. If your bike meets these criteria, you can legally ride it anywhere a bike can be ridden. If your eBike doesn\u2019t meet these standards, it will need to be registered and insured as a motor vehicle, and you will need a license and a helmet. USA The US is one of the more difficult countries to navigate eBike regulations because the rules will vary depending on what state you live in, and even then, the laws are written in legal-ese that just about require a member of your local bar association to translate. According to federal legislation enacted by congress in 2002, an eBike is defined as, \u201cA two- or three-wheeled vehicle with fully operable pedals and an electric motor of less than 750 watts (1 h.p.), whose maximum speed on a paved level surface, when powered solely by such a motor while ridden by an operator who weighs 170 pounds, is less than 20 mph.\u201d Unfortunately, state laws surrounding eBikes often supersede this legislation. Currently, 33 states have statutes that define an eBike in some manner while the rest lack a specific definition, and may lump them in with another vehicle class. To make things even more confusing, in states like Mississippi there is no mention of eBikes in the wording of the laws, but a general opinion issued by the Attorney General says an electric bicycle should be classified as a regular bike. Thirteen states have taken up the three-tiered system outlined by The Bicycle Product Suppliers Association which divides electric bikes up based on their maximum assisted speed: Class 1: the motor provides assistance only when the rider is pedalling and cuts out a 20mph Class 2: the motor can contribute regardless of pedalling but is governed to 20mph Class 3: the motor provides assistance when the rider is pedalling but cuts out at 28mph and must be equipped with a speedometer. Regardless of class, the motor can only generate a maximum of 750-watts, and the class must be labelled clearly. In the 17 states that lump eBikes in with other classes of vehicles, licensing and registration may be required to operate an eBike. If your head is spinning trying to keep these rules straight, our friends over at People for Bikes have a handy state by state guide. Australia Australians love simplicity and that is why eBikes are split into throttle operated and non-throttle operated. Throttle operated eBikes must be limited to 200-watts and 25kph, while pedal assist can provide up to 250-watts of assistance but is limited to the same speed limit. In keeping with this simplicity, anything that doesn\u2019t abide by the above is considered a motorbike by law, and must be licensed and insured. Which motor and battery do I need? The best e-bike motors can be located in several areas of the bike, depending on which brand and model you opt for, and generally consist of a front-drive, mid-drive or rear-drive motor system, located in the front hub, bottom bracket and rear hub respectively. While any of the three options will serve you fine, the motor system location will often have an impact on the handling of your bike, so it's worth considering whether or not you would have a preference. Generally, a mid-drive motor system is the best of the three, as it spreads the weight more evenly throughout the bike. Since the motor and battery are the heaviest parts, it's better to have that heft closer to the ground and between the wheels, so as not to throw off your centre of gravity. Batteries on the other hand are described in Wh (watt-hours), which takes into account both their output and capacity. The larger the number, the further your battery will take you on a single charge, and the heavier it will be.",

    "full_description": "Believe it or not, the Raspberry Pi is almost ten years old. In this relatively short period the Pi has ushered in a new revolution in computing that stretches far beyond its original remit which was to promote basic computer science education in schools. There have been several Pi developments over the past few years. The Pi Zero was released in 2015, and the Pi and its 'essentials' kit is available for less than \u00a310 (around $13, AU$18). The Pi Zero W was added to the Zero family in February 2017, featuring a 1GHz processor, 512MB RAM and support for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, again all for just over \u00a315 (around $19, AU$27) with accessories. The latest addition to the family is the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B that now features a quad-core 1.5Ghz processor. Unlike previous iterations of the single board computer (SBC), there are now three variants of the Raspberry Pi 4; with 2GB, 4GB and 8GB of RAM. This opens up the device to even more use cases that one couldn\u2019t even have imagined when the original device made its debut in 2012. Of course if you just need to use it as a computer, there\u2019s the Raspberry Pi 400 , which rolls a 1.8Ghz Raspberry Pi inside a keyboard. What makes the Raspberry Pi so successful is that it\u2019s backed by an equally impressive line of software that allows tinkerers to adapt the tiny computer for different tasks. Here we round up some of the best Raspberry Pi distros that allow you to consume the device in various ways. We've also featured the best Linux training providers and online courses . Raspberry Pi OS (formerly known as Raspbian) is the official distro of the Raspberry Pi. It\u2019s based on the venerable Debian Linux project and uses a customized LXDE-based desktop environment that uses the Openbox window manager to present a desktop that is functional, looks elegant, and doesn\u2019t consume too many resources. The highlight of the distro is that it ships with several educational apps such as Wolfram Mathematica and a version of Minecraft called Minecraft Pi. However, that doesn\u2019t take away the fact that it\u2019s also a general purpose distro. In fact, the latest version of the release has had several tweaks and tests to ensure it performs flawlessly with video conferencing software such as Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom. You can either install the distro using the Raspberry Pi imager app in your existing Windows, Linux , or macOS installation, or flash the distro\u2019s image to an SD card manually. The distro has one of the most active community of users and you\u2019ll have no trouble finding documentation and video tutorials for using the distro. Volumio is designed to play and stream music, and while Volumio will work with any of the Raspberry Pi boards (and several other SBCs as well), it\u2019s an ideal project for the Raspberry Pi Zero. Using Volumio you can setup a headless media server on the Pi that can play music in all the popular formats from a connected USB or a NAS device. The distro is easy to set up and you can easily use its intuitive interface to manage your music from the web browser. You can also manage your music through the distro\u2019s official apps on iOS and Android, or use any of the MPD-capable apps such as MPDroid. Volumio supports the most popular audio file formats out of the box and supports a large number of USB DACs so you can plug in your amplifiers and other equipment to enhance your listening experience. You can also use Volumio as a UPNP/DLNA and AirPlay receiver, and it ships with built-in support for web radio and plugins for streaming music from Spotify and YouTube. If you're a fan of classic games, grab a copy of the RetroPie distro and transfer it to your SD card.

The only caveat is that you must get your own ROMs. There are several that can be legally downloaded for free and you can even create your own from old cartridges using adapters like the Retrode in conjunction with your Mac/PC. The Internet Archive also has many ROMs which are free to download \u2013 although be sure to check this is legal in your jurisdiction before going ahead. You can use the Raspberry Pi to do all kinds of geeky things. But one of the most interesting uses for the puny little device is that of a home theatre PC. Using LibreELEC you can use the miniscule SBC and the fact that it runs silently, to build your own entertainment center.

    "description": "While many people are clamoring for a Nintendo Switch with better hardware, a lead designer on an upcoming Switch port sees things differently.",
    "content": "<article> <p>With the polarizing release of the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-oled-review\">Nintendo Switch OLED</a> leading many <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nintendo-switch\">Switch</a> owners to stick with their original models, interest in an eventual upgraded version remains high. A potential <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-2\">Nintendo Switch Pro</a> could help bridge the gap in tech between it and competitors over on <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ps5\">PS5</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-series-x\">Xbox Series X</a>/S.</p><p>However, one developer in particular feels that Nintendo shouldn't feel pressured to develop more powerful hardware. World War Z lead designer Dmitry Grigorenko, from Saber Interactive, spoke to <a href=\"https://nintendoeverything.com/world-war-z-dev-there-is-no-such-thing-as-an-impossible-port-switch-doesnt-really-need-more-powerful-version/\" target=\"_blank\">Nintendo Everything</a>, where he was asked what he'd like to see in a potential Nintendo Switch Pro.</p><p>While he suggested he'd like to see better hardware and less patch size limitations, Grigorenko gave an interesting answer: \"I don\u2019t think the Switch needs a more powerful version that badly. Saber and many other talented studios have already proven that there is no such thing as an impossible port. Nintendo consoles were never about hardware, they were always about something that boosts your gameplay experience, and I can\u2019t wait to see what they come up with next.\"</p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/5-games-i-cant-wait-to-play-on-steam-deck\">Steam Deck</a>: 5 games we can't wait to play</li><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-nintendo-switch-games\">Best Nintendo Switch games</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-games-a-brief-introduction-to-every-game\">Nintendo Switch Online N64 games</a>: a brief introduction</li></ul> <p>Grigorenko of course has credentials to back up his statement. Saber Interactive developed the impressive <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/the-witcher-3-on-nintendo-switch-may-mean-i-finally-play-the-dlc\">Switch port of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, and more recently brought the graphically demanding SnowRunner to Nintendo's handheld. Saber is also developing the Switch port of another visually stunning title - <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/kingdom-come-deliverance\">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a>.</p><p>Other developers are in the same boat as Saber Interactive, developing so-called \"impossible ports\" for the modestly powered Switch. Perhaps the most prolific is Panic Button, who created very solid Switch ports of Warframe, Subnautica and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/doom-eternal-review\">Doom Eternal</a> to name but a few. </p><p>All come with compromises to accommodate the Switch's less powerful hardware of course, such as a 30fps framerate target and sub-HD resolutions, but the work done to get these games running on Nintendo's handheld hybrid is nothing short of impressive.</p> <figure data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1212px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\"><img id=\"UUf2Vv6uYqtAMk6RVW5eQC\" name=\"4k-switch-oled.jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED 4K secreto\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UUf2Vv6uYqtAMk6RVW5eQC.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1212\" height=\"682\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" ><span class=\"caption-text\">Switch OLED is a step in the right direction, but we'd like to see more. </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <hr> <h2 id=\"the-case-for-better-switch-hardware-5\">The case for better Switch hardware?</h2> <p>We're not going to say Grigorenko and like-minded individuals are wrong. He is in fact absolutely right that the last few console generations, for Nintendo, were never about powerful hardware. The Wii, for example, didn't support HD in an era where that was cutting-edge display technology. It still defied expectations and became the best-selling home console of that generation.</p><p>Similarly, Nintendo Switch is undoubtedly underpowered compared to its competition, and doesn't support 4K resolution as they do. It doesn't feature a lightning-fast <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/youre-going-to-want-a-speedy-nvme-ssd-if-you-want-to-keep-up-with-the-ps5\">NVMe SSD</a>, bags of storage space, or even a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-is-a-bad-deal-no-matter-how-you-slice-it\">decent online infrastructure</a>. But that hasn't stopped the Switch family of consoles to shift over 89 million units (as of June 2021).</p><p>However, that astronomic sales figure can likely be attributed to Switch's novelty as a handheld hybrid, as well as Nintendo's usual penchant for developing some of the best looking and best playing games on the market. Getting \"impossible ports\" on the Switch isn't necessarily a good thing, and many of them - like <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/the-most-gruesome-fatalities-in-mortal-kombat-history\">Mortal Kombat 11</a> - stick out like a sore thumb in just how inferior they look compared to the competition.</p><p>Of course, the Switch is arguably the console of choice for less graphically demanding titles. Indie darlings like <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/games-of-the-generation-hollow-knight-is-a-haunting-2d-platformer-you-need-to-master\">Hollow Knight</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-roguelike-games-a-beginners-guide-to-the-die-a-lot-genre\">Dead Cells</a>, Celeste and more both play and look excellent in both handheld and docked modes.

    "full_description": "With the polarizing release of the Nintendo Switch OLED leading many Switch owners to stick with their original models, interest in an eventual upgraded version remains high. A potential Nintendo Switch Pro could help bridge the gap in tech between it and competitors over on PS5 and Xbox Series X /S. However, one developer in particular feels that Nintendo shouldn't feel pressured to develop more powerful hardware. World War Z lead designer Dmitry Grigorenko, from Saber Interactive, spoke to Nintendo Everything , where he was asked what he'd like to see in a potential Nintendo Switch Pro. While he suggested he'd like to see better hardware and less patch size limitations, Grigorenko gave an interesting answer: \"I don\u2019t think the Switch needs a more powerful version that badly. Saber and many other talented studios have already proven that there is no such thing as an impossible port. Nintendo consoles were never about hardware, they were always about something that boosts your gameplay experience, and I can\u2019t wait to see what they come up with next.\" Grigorenko of course has credentials to back up his statement. Saber Interactive developed the impressive Switch port of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt , and more recently brought the graphically demanding SnowRunner to Nintendo's handheld. Saber is also developing the Switch port of another visually stunning title - Kingdom Come: Deliverance . Other developers are in the same boat as Saber Interactive, developing so-called \"impossible ports\" for the modestly powered Switch. Perhaps the most prolific is Panic Button, who created very solid Switch ports of Warframe, Subnautica and Doom Eternal to name but a few. All come with compromises to accommodate the Switch's less powerful hardware of course, such as a 30fps framerate target and sub-HD resolutions, but the work done to get these games running on Nintendo's handheld hybrid is nothing short of impressive. We're not going to say Grigorenko and like-minded individuals are wrong. He is in fact absolutely right that the last few console generations, for Nintendo, were never about powerful hardware. The Wii, for example, didn't support HD in an era where that was cutting-edge display technology. It still defied expectations and became the best-selling home console of that generation. Similarly, Nintendo Switch is undoubtedly underpowered compared to its competition, and doesn't support 4K resolution as they do. It doesn't feature a lightning-fast NVMe SSD , bags of storage space, or even a decent online infrastructure . But that hasn't stopped the Switch family of consoles to shift over 89 million units (as of June 2021). However, that astronomic sales figure can likely be attributed to Switch's novelty as a handheld hybrid, as well as Nintendo's usual penchant for developing some of the best looking and best playing games on the market. Getting \"impossible ports\" on the Switch isn't necessarily a good thing, and many of them - like Mortal Kombat 11 - stick out like a sore thumb in just how inferior they look compared to the competition. Of course, the Switch is arguably the console of choice for less graphically demanding titles. Indie darlings like Hollow Knight , Dead Cells , Celeste and more both play and look excellent in both handheld and docked modes. However, the cracks do start to show when booting up one of these so-called \"impossible\" ports, many of which could be deemed unpleasant to play in handheld mode thanks to soupy, sub-720p resolutions. Better hardware, such as what we might see with a Nintendo Switch Pro, could afford developers the opportunity to port to Switch with fewer compromises. Who doesn't want to be able to play Doom Eternal at a high framerate like we'll be able to on Valve's upcoming Steam Deck ? The audience for a Nintendo Switch Pro is certainly there, even if the lack of one hasn't stopped Nintendo and other developers from creating and porting excellent titles to the handheld. But if better hardware can help developers bring more consistently great ports to the console with less irksome limitations, then we say bring it on.",

Hawaii-based Privateer remains in stealth mode a month after Wozniak and co-founder Alex Fielding announced its existence , but we know the company aims to tackle humanity's growing problem with space junk , which threatens to hinder our exploration of the final frontier. And Privateer will focus, at least initially, on improving our knowledge of the teeming orbital population. \"We really got started with the goal of building \u2026 the Google Maps of space,\" Fielding told TechCrunch recently . Related: 7 wild ways to destroy orbital debris The company has just hired one of the people who will lead this ambitious effort, tapping aerodynamicist and \"space environmentalist\" Moriba Jah as its chief scientific adviser. \"We are so proud to have a scientist and human of Moriba's caliber joining the Privateer team. His knowledge of this issue is only exceeded by his passion for building solutions to address it,\" Wozniak said in an emailed statement. \"Some might say that Privateer benefits from a connection with my name, whereas I see it as a feather in my cap to be connected to this great group and company,\" Wozniak said. Jah is an associate professor of aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics at the University of Texas at Austin. He's an expert on space junk and one of the leading voices urging humanity to do something about it. \"My work has been heavily involved in science and technology research focused on space safety, security and sustainability,\" Jah said in the same statement. \"I answer an inner clarion call to action in reminding humanity of its intergenerational contract of stewardship and custodianship, honoring and recognizing the interconnectedness amongst all things, and that action is best when born from compassion.\" He said he's long been looking for \"kindred spirits\" willing to be as bold as the 14th-century Medici family of Florence, whose patronage helped catalyze the Renaissance . \"At Privateer, we are Medici-bold, creating knowledge and solutions with a focus on decision intelligence at the speed of relevance,\" Jah said. \"By embracing complexity, we take the state of the possible and transform it into the state of practice, recruiting the spirit of stewardship and sustainability to repair our broken relationship with our environment.\" \u2014 Space junk menace: New guidelines urged to help fight orbital debris \u2014 Astronomers say Starlink and other constellations could threaten science \u2014 Satellite crashes, asteroid impacts and space weather pose big risks Privateer's boldness is already apparent. The company plans to launch its first satellite, a tiny cubesat bristling with 42 sensors, in February and its second two months later, according to TechCrunch . Jah previously served as a spacecraft navigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.

With remote working becoming the new normal, work hours have blurred and people around the world are struggling to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

The company said that Work Profile would later be expanded to include anyone with an Android phone who will be able to turn off their business apps with just one button. The company explains that it would make its Work Profile tool available for users next year, as part of Google Workspace. For users who have not used the Work Profile tool, it is the company\u2019s built-in service on all modern Android phones that allows users to add their company\u2019s email apps to their personal phone, with the option to completely switch off those apps with one button.

    "full_description": "The woolly mammoth is an ancient ancestor of modern elephants covered with fur that roamed the ancient Earth alongside early humans. The massive creatures roamed the Earth for 5 million years before going extinct four thousand years ago. Some have speculated that the reason the woolly mammoth went extinct was from overhunting by ancient humans. However, research conducted over the last decade has found a different reason the mammoth went extinct, and it had nothing to do with humans. Geneticists analyzed ancient environmental DNA, and the data shows the woolly mammoth went extinct due to global warming in the distant past. Researchers believe when the icebergs melted, it was too wet for the animals to survive because the vegetation they ate was practically wiped out. The scientists used DNA shotgun sequencing to analyze plant and animal remains from the environment for the research. Among the material they analyzed were urine, feces, and skin cells taken from soil samples collected over two decades during the research of sites in the Arctic where mammoth remains were discovered. Modern DNA technology allows DNA to be analyzed without sourcing it from bones or teeth. According to Professor Eske Willerslev, there\u2019s been an argument for a century on why mammoths went extinct. He and his group of researchers have been able to prove it wasn\u2019t climate change alone that ended the mammoth\u2019s time on the planet. The speed of climate change also contributed to their extinction. He says mammoths could not adapt quickly enough when the landscape changed dramatically, making their food source scarce. When the climate suddenly warmed, the grasslands the mammoths relied on were replaced by various trees and wetland plants. The team sequenced the DNA from 1500 Arctic plants in their research, allowing them to draw their conclusions. Project researchers also determined that during the most recent ice age, which ended 12,000 years ago, the roaming range of the herds decreased. However, they didn\u2019t all go extinct. Mammoths survived beyond the last Ice Age in different regions into the current era we live in, called the Holocene, before meeting their end.",

    "full_description": "Apple on Friday announced a major update to its App Store payment policy\u2014allowing developers to provide information to their customers regarding making payments outside the App Store, bypassing Apple\u2019s commission of 15 to 30 percent. The new guidelines released by Apple noted that developers will be able to ask their users for basic information, such as names and e-mail addresses, as long as its optional, and not a required part of using their app. Previously, Apple did not allow developers to direct users through email to their websites to pay for digital products. \u201cTo give developers even more flexibility to reach their customers, Apple is also clarifying that developers can use communications, such as email, to share information about payment methods outside of their iOS app,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cAs always, developers will not pay Apple a commission on any purchases taking place outside of their app or the App Store. Users must consent to the communication and have the right to opt-out. By informing customers of alternative payment options, developers can avoid paying Apple\u2019s commissions and, moreover, exert competitive pressure on Apple to discipline its pricing,\u201d the company added. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png It is worth noting that the change in Apple\u2019s payment policy still does not allow developers to have an independent payment system. However, Apple now won\u2019t stop developers from including external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms that allows developers to communicate with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration. Meanwhile, last week, Google also announced that it is lowering its Play store fees for all subscription-based services to 15 percent from the existing 30 per cent starting January 1, 2022. Read more | Google\u2019s slashed Play Store subscription fee still a reduced \u2018lagaan\u2019: ADIF The Alliance of Digital India Foundation (ADIF), a think tank with more than 440 digital startups, has called Apple\u2019s new update a major victory for the developer and startup community who have been vocal against the restrictive and anti-competitive practices of the two big tech giants through their AppStore/Play Store policies. \u201cPractices that restrict app developers with their product and user experience choices still persist. For instance, Apple has still not relented on allowing alternative payment systems to be embedded directly in their apps. It is crucial now to ensure that the efforts towards making the app economy a fair marketplace are sustained. It is only when all such restrictive practices are also done away with that the app marketplace can be deemed a true level playing field that allows for innovation to thrive,\u201d asserted Sijo Kuruvilla George, Executive Director, ADIF.",

    "description": "Apple announced a long-awaited update to the AirPods at its Unleashed event earlier this month.The AirPods (3rd generation) -- Apple's first major redesign of its popular flagship wireless earbuds -- introduces an entirely new look, in addition to adding in great like spatial audio and Adaptive EQ borrowed from the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max, alongside longer battery life.Most striking is the new design of the AirPods, which offers a shorter stem and a larger earpiece that is less prone to slipping out of your ears during an intense running session (a longstanding gripe of AirPods users). The more snug fit also means the audio quality is less disturbed by the outside environment, making sounds more crisp and direct. To create the new contoured shape, Apple took thousands of ear scans and measurements, in-depth studies of acoustics and heat mapped modeling to create a lightweight and intentional earpiece that is optimized for comfort. The stem also features a force sensor -- a feature of the AirPods Pro that users find intuitive -- that allows for easier maneuvering between songs right from the buds. And the AirPods and its case now also have a greater sweat and water resistance rating of IPX4, just like the AirPods Pro.Major enhancements have also been made to the audio quality -- a feature that is crucial for a great pair of headphones. Apple has introduced a custom driver and high dynamic range amplifier to create richer bass and smooth high frequencies. The voice quality has been improved to optimize voice clarity during phone calls, with an inset microphone embedded in each earbud that is covered in a special acoustic mesh to reduce wind noise. In addition, they also feature AAC-ELD, a superior codec that allows for full-HD voice quality.Fan-favorite spatial audio with dynamic head tracking has been added to the new AirPods, which uses advanced spatial audio algorithms to provide theatre-like sound. The result is rich and layered audio that sounds like it's coming from all around you, definitely an upgrade most noticeable when watching movies, listening to music or when speaking on a group chat. The device utilizes a powerful H1 chip and employs Adaptive EQ to customize the listening experience for each user, while an inward-facing microphone has been added to each bud to listen to the sound emerging from the device and automatically tune the low-and-mid frequencies to the user's ear shape in real-time.In addition, Apple has expanded the device's battery life with up to 6 hours of listening from a single charge -- an hour upgrade from the previous generation -- and has introduced MagSafe charging for the case for even more charging options.And like the previous models, AirPods include delightful features like one-tap setup, in-ear detection using an all-new skin detect optical sensor, beamforming microphones, audio sharing, Siri and Find My built right into the device.The AirPods (3rd generation) will be available for $179 USD in-store and online beginning Tuesday, October 26. The price of the AirPods (2nd generation) has also dropped to $129 USD while the AirPods Pro now comes with the MagSafe charging case for the same price of $249 USD.Overall, it appears that Apple carefully crafted the new iteration of AirPods by utilizing some of the best features available in the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max while also giving the buds new hardware and a complete redesign. The result is both a great standalone product as well as a great addition to the full AirPods family lineup.Click here to view full gallery at HYPEBEAST",

    "content": "<article> <p>Marvel's Eternals hasn't drawn the same level of critical enthusiasm we usually see reserved for the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-watch-the-marvel-movies-in-order\">Marvel movies</a> so far. At the time of writing, after 41 reviews \u2013 meaning there's a big caveat that this score is still likely to change a lot, as more review pour in \u2013 Eternals <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eternals/reviews?intcmp=rt-scorecard_tomatometer-reviews\" target=\"_blank\">sits at 71% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes</a>. That's lower than Black Widow (79%), Avengers: Age of Ultron (76%) and Iron Man 2 (71%).</p><p>So far, it's only higher than The Incredible Hulk (67%) and Thor: The Dark World (66%) in the MCU.</p><p>To be fair to Marvel's newest film, this isn't a precise science, and like we say, this is a small sample size of what's likely to be the overall number of reviews for the film. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, for example, ended up with 313 reviews in total. So Eternals has a long way to go.</p><p>What's notable about the critical reception to Eternals, though, is that some outlets haven't gelled with the way Chloe Zhao's movie reframes the MCU <em>at all</em>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/24/eternals-review-marvel-chloe-zhao-angelina-jolie-salma-hayek-powerpoint\">The Guardian</a>, for example, calls it \"magic hour meets PowerPoint\", the former in reference to the movie's on-location sunset shots, and the latter in reference to just how much additional lore the film stuffs into the MCU. <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2021/10/24/eternals-review-marvel-attempts-push-boundaries-result-insipid/\" target=\"_blank\">The Telegraph</a> calls the film \"insipid\", while <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22741019/eternals-review-marvel\" target=\"_blank\">Polygon</a> says it's a \"very messy movie\". </p><p>Still, as 71% positive reviews suggests, plenty of outlets like it, too.

    "full_description": "Marvel's Eternals hasn't drawn the same level of critical enthusiasm we usually see reserved for the Marvel movies so far. At the time of writing, after 41 reviews \u2013 meaning there's a big caveat that this score is still likely to change a lot, as more review pour in \u2013 Eternals sits at 71% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes . That's lower than Black Widow (79%), Avengers: Age of Ultron (76%) and Iron Man 2 (71%). So far, it's only higher than The Incredible Hulk (67%) and Thor: The Dark World (66%) in the MCU. To be fair to Marvel's newest film, this isn't a precise science, and like we say, this is a small sample size of what's likely to be the overall number of reviews for the film. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, for example, ended up with 313 reviews in total. So Eternals has a long way to go. What's notable about the critical reception to Eternals, though, is that some outlets haven't gelled with the way Chloe Zhao's movie reframes the MCU at all . The Guardian , for example, calls it \"magic hour meets PowerPoint\", the former in reference to the movie's on-location sunset shots, and the latter in reference to just how much additional lore the film stuffs into the MCU. The Telegraph calls the film \"insipid\", while Polygon says it's a \"very messy movie\". Still, as 71% positive reviews suggests, plenty of outlets like it, too. Our sister site GamesRadar says \"Chlo\u00e9 Zhao gives the MCU just the kick in the pants it needs at this phase in its evolution.\" A nice notice on The Observer says \"almost all the relationships between the many Eternals crackle with energy and history\", and praises two characters for having sexual chemistry, which is something the MCU has always seemed afraid of. So, why is Eternals proving divisive? Well, the epic scope of the film sounds like a blessing and a curse \u2013 it's set over thousands of years, and retroactively fits these god-type characters into an MCU that already has the nine realms seen in Thor and the ancient sorcerers of Doctor Strange. The film goes out of its way to provide a reason why the characters didn't intervene when Thanos snapped away half the universe, which is bound to be a tough sell. Some critics seemed to like the movies' vastness, praising its ambition, while others have found it unwieldy. On TechRadar, we've seen the film, and we'll publish our review of Eternals the closer we get to release \u2013 and we'll update this page as the critic average around the film solidifies. The thing is, Marvel needed to shake up the MCU on the big screen. Even if the numbers don't tell this story, Black Widow was such a rote film \u2013 a predictable solo flick that shed no real light on its lead and wasn't worth the pandemic-prolonged wait. The longer the MCU goes on, the more it's at risk of becoming formulaic. It sounds like Marvel's Eternals is the opposite of that, with its own distinctive visual style and its own dimension of lore that's designed to give the MCU more of an extended life. There was always a danger it wasn't going to land, but for once, no one can really accuse Marvel Studios of being risk-averse.

    "description": "World stocks held their ground on Monday after eight consecutive sessions of gains, as traders weighed the prospects of strong corporate earnings in the backdrop of widening inflation risks from multi-year high crude oil prices. European stocks edged higher in early London trading while US stock futures held firm as investors shrugged off the possible impact from news of a pilot property tax in China and ongoing troubles in the sector. While the broader economic momentum has slowed in recent weeks and market-implied inflation risks have increased with break-even rates on both sides of the Atlantic racing to multi-year highs, equity markets have been broadly unfazed. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of world stocks steadied below an early September high after notching up eight consecutive sessions of gains, its longest winning streak since late May, according to Refinitiv data. European stocks steadied while US stock futures tiptoed higher as a busy week for third-quarter corporate earnings get underway. \u201cEquity markets have had a kitchen sink of worries thrown at them \u2013 slower growth, rising costs, and higher interest rates. However, corporate earnings have more than offset those declines so far in 2021,\u201d said Marija Veitmane, a senior strategist at State Street Global Markets. \u201cPeak growth clearly is not peak earnings as we have been highlighting.\u201d Of the 117 S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far, 65 per cent have exceeded consensus expectations by at least a standard deviation of analyst estimates, a rate if sustained would rank the September quarter among the strongest on record behind an already strong first half, according to Goldman Sachs. In Europe, the number of companies that have beaten expectations in the third quarter is now past 60 per cent, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data. On Monday, Facebook will kick off earnings for tech giants with other heavyweights including Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet, and European and Asian financial behemoths from Deutsche Bank to Lloyds will report later in the week. Strong corporate earnings have also stalled the US dollar\u2019s recent advance even as money markets have advanced their expectations of policy tightening. The dollar index held near a one-month low of 93.483, down 0.16 per cent on the day as hedge funds cut their dollar long positions for a second consecutive week. The risk friendlier mood has weighed on safe-haven currencies like the yen, as have rising energy prices which supported currencies including the Aussie and Canadian dollars. Traders are waiting for the third-quarter US GDP figures due Thursday, with flash euro area CPI readings for October also a key indicator after the gauge jumped to a 2008 high last month. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on Friday said the US central bank should start the process of reducing its support of the economy by cutting back on its asset purchases, but should not yet touch interest rates. As tapering looms, US benchmark yields have been rising and yields on 10-year Treasury notes held below a five-month high of 1.7064 per cent hit last week. Oil prices rose further, with US crude hitting a seven-year high as global supply remained tight amid strong demand worldwide. Brent crude rose 0.83 per cent to $86.24 a barrel, while US crude rose 0.80 per cent to $84.51. Spot gold rose 0.36 per cent to $1,798 an ounce after posting gains for the past two weeks on rising inflation concerns, and the weakening dollar. Bitcoin, another asset oft described as an inflation hedge, was last at $62,000, up 1.8 per cent after last week\u2019s turbulent trade when it hit a new high of $67,016. \u2013 Reuters",

    "content": "Frost forms different patterns as it spreads across a surface depending upon the level of humidity, a novel imaging technique has revealed. These patterns range from complete surface coverage to fractal geometries. Lukas Hauer, at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Germany, and his colleagues grew the frost on a microstructured surface covered in an array of micropillars spaced 30 \u00b5m apart. While this doesn\u2019t replicate the types of surfaces that frost grows on naturally, it allowed the researchers to control the distribution of water droplets at the start of experiments. And condensation does tend to form in a pattern. \u201cWhen you have condensation on a surface, little droplets form on the surface and these droplets are usually separated by a certain distance and this distance is actually an average value. This is basically a property of the wettability of the surface,\u201d explains Hauer. \u201cSo even if you have a smooth surface that is not microstructured, you will still see that droplets forming on the surface are separated by a characteristic distance.\u201d googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-3759129-1'); }); To see how frost changed with humidity, the researchers cooled the surface to \u221230\u00b0C and placed it in a sealed chamber. They then introduced nitrogen gas with a water vapour content of 14%, 24% or 34%. To observe the frost patterns, they used laser-induced fluorescence microscopy. The microstructure surface was infiltrated with silicon oil dyed with a fluorescent powder, which helped visualize the frost patches by increasing surface contrast. This is the first time that this technique has been used for imaging frost and the researchers say that it allowed them to visualize frost formation in a more accurate and detailed way. After the gas is introduced to the chamber, supercooled droplets condense on the micropillar tops, before randomly starting to freeze. These become frost nucleation sites, with frost patches growing out from them facilitated by water vapour. At the lowest humidity level (14%), most of the droplets evaporated quickly. This meant that few froze and those that did were unable to link with other droplets. Instead, they formed small spiky frost patches as droplets of water vapour froze to them. At the highest humidity level of 34%, frost covered the surface. Evaporation was slower and almost all the droplets formed nucleated frost patches and ended up connecting to each other. Growing frost patches did halt as they approached each other, however, creating a small ditch that separated them. Frost formation: (a) At a relative humidity (RH) of 14%, a single frost patch is seen with arbitrarily directed frost spikes. (b) At 24% RH, multiple frost patches form. (c) At 34% RH, the surface is nearly entirely covered by frost (scale bars, 500 \u00b5m). (Courtesy: CC BY 4.0/Phys. Rev. E 10.1103/PhysRevE.104.044901) Intermediate humidity (24%) produced an intermediate level of evaporation. Frost patches spread out and connected with neighbouring liquid droplets, growing larger than in the low-humidity environment. But this did not always happen, as some droplets evaporated before the frost bridges could reach them. This led to a branching pattern with a fractal geometry. \u201cIt is a less dense frost; with the humidity, the density of the frost changes,\u201d explains Doris Vollmer, also at the Max Planck Institute. Hauer tells Physics World that the rate of evaporation is linked to the initial size of the water droplets. In less humid environments, small water droplets condensate on the micropillars and evaporate quickly. The researchers also found that the number and size of frost patches can be tuned by surface temperature. At \u221225\u00b0C, with a relative humidity at 28%, a few large frost patches formed. When the temperature was reduced to \u221235\u00b0C, more but smaller frost patches formed, and at \u221245\u00b0C, the droplets all froze straight after condensation, creating almost as many frost patches as micropillars. Read more Ice crystals jump off surfaces in new electrostatic de-icing technique Vollmer tells Physics World that improving our theoretical understanding of frost formation could help us reduce frosting and associated damage. She explains that understanding how humidity and temperature interact could allow us to develop different techniques for different parts of the world and different times of the year, which are linked to local environmental conditions, such as different anti-frosting surfaces. \u201cBut it is difficult, because it is much, much more difficult to prevent frost formation than it to describe frost formation,\u201d Vollmer says.

As you move from website to website, trackers on those sites report on your digital movements to advertisers and other interested parties. They can even track your actual IRL moves and who you're with, based on your phone's networks and location. Surfshark, maker of the popular VPN (we gave it a rating of 4, which is excellent) did some digging in a report called Who's Tracking You? to find which websites do the most tracking. Using a site list comprising the most popular websites according to SimilarWeb and AllYouCanRead , Surfshark found that the Big Tech companies with the most trackers are Google with 18, Microsoft with 17, and Amazon with 11. Of other popular sites it included, the worst offender is click-bait bro-site theChive, with 143 trackers alone. Others in the top five include news outlets Salon and NY Daily News, and HGTV. Surfshark posits the possibility that such sites don't like to carry too many advertisements\u2014so this may be how they make up for that lack of revenue. Just as interesting are the sites not doing much tracking. That top five includes Wikipedia and TikTok, which are tied for first place with only three trackers found on each. Porn site XVideos is fourth (tied with Instagram), and Netflix is fifth. You can see the full top 10 at the top and bottom of the list here, or click over to Who's Tracking You? for an interactive list you can reorder by the type of sites you visit. It reveals that lifestyle sites led by theChive, LADbible, and Refinery29 had the most trackers on average. And in general, music and science sites had the least number of trackers. If you're worried about your privacy after reading this, Surfshark suggests you install a VPN (of course) to foil trackers. That\u2019s not 100% effective, so the company also has an infographic in the report that covers different kinds of trackers, such as cookies, tracking pixels, and fingerprinting, and how to go deeper in blocking trackers.

    "full_description": "LONDON -- Former Facebook data scientist turned whistleblower Frances Haugen plans to answer questions Monday from lawmakers in the United Kingdom who are working on legislation to rein in the power of social media companies. Haugen is set to appear before a parliamentary committee scrutinizing the British government's draft legislation to crack down on harmful online content, and her comments could help lawmakers beef up the new rules. She's testifying the same day Facebook is expected to release its latest earnings. It will be her second appearance before lawmakers after she testified in the U.S. Senate earlier this month about the danger she says the company poses, from harming children to inciting political violence and fueling misinformation. Haugen cited internal research documents she secretly copied before leaving her job in Facebook's civic integrity unit. She told U.S. lawmakers that she thinks a federal regulator is needed to oversee digital giants like Facebook, something that officials in Britain and the European Union are already working on. The U.K. government's online safety bill calls for setting up a regulator that would hold companies to account when it comes to removing harmful or illegal content from their platforms, such as terrorist material or child sex abuse images. \"This is quite a big moment,\" Damian Collins, the lawmaker who chairs the committee, said ahead of the hearing. \"This is a moment, sort of like Cambridge Analytica, but possibly bigger in that I think it provides a real window into the soul of these companies.\" Collins was referring to the 2018 debacle involving data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica, which gathered details on as many as 87 million Facebook users without their permission. Haugen also is scheduled to meet next month with European Union officials in Brussels, where the bloc's executive commission is updating its digital rulebook to better protect internet users by holding online companies more responsible for illegal or dangerous content. Under the U.K. rules, expected to take effect next year, Silicon Valley giants face an ultimate penalty of up to 10% of their global revenue for any violations. The EU is proposing a similar penalty. The U.K. committee will be hoping to hear more from Haugen about the data that tech companies have gathered. Collins said the internal files that Haugen has turned over to U.S. authorities are important because it shows the kind of information that Facebook holds -- and what regulators should be asking when they investigate these companies. The committee has already heard from another Facebook whistleblower, Sophie Zhang, who raised the alarm after finding evidence of online political manipulation in countries such as Honduras and Azerbaijan before she was fired.

She's testifying the same day that Facebook is set to release its latest earnings and that The Associated Press and other news organizations started publishing stories based on thousands of pages of internal company documents she obtained. It will be her second appearance before lawmakers after she testified in the U.S. Senate earlier this month about the danger she says the company poses, from harming children to inciting political violence and fueling misinformation. Haugen cited internal research documents she secretly copied before leaving her job in Facebook's civic integrity unit. The documents, which Haugen provided to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, allege Facebook prioritized profits over safety and hid its own research from investors and the public. Some stories based on the files have already been published, exposing internal turmoil after Facebook was blindsided by the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot and how it dithered over curbing divisive content in India, and more is to come. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has disputed Haugen's portrayal of the company as one that puts profit over the well-being of its users or that pushes divisive content, saying a false picture is being painted. But he does agree on the need for updated internet regulations, saying lawmakers are best able to assess the tradeoffs. Haugen told U.S. lawmakers that she thinks a federal regulator is needed to oversee digital giants like Facebook, something that officials in Britain and the European Union are already working on.

Representatives from Facebook and other social media companies plan to speak to the committee Thursday. Ahead of the hearing, Haugen met the father of Molly Russell, a 14-year-old girl who killed herself in 2017 after viewing disturbing content on Facebook-owned Instagram. In a chat filmed by the BBC, Ian Russell told Haugen that after Molly's death, her family found notes she wrote about being addicted to Instagram.

    "full_description": "LONDON -- Former Facebook data scientist turned whistleblower Frances Haugen on Monday told lawmakers in the United Kingdom working on legislation to rein in social media companies that the company is making online hate and extremism worse and outlined how it could improve online safety. Haugen appeared before a parliamentary committee scrutinizing the British government's draft legislation to crack down on harmful online content, and her comments could help lawmakers beef up the rules. She's testifying the same day that Facebook is set to release its latest earnings and that The Associated Press and other news organizations started publishing stories based on thousands of pages of internal company documents she obtained. Haugen told U.K. lawmakers how Facebook Groups amplifies online hate, saying algorithms that prioritize engagement take people with mainstream interests and push them to the extremes. She said the company could add moderators to prevent groups from being used to spread extremist views. \"Unquestionably, it's making hate worse,\" she said. Haugen added that she was \"shocked to hear recently that Facebook wants to double down on the metaverse and that they're gonna hire 10,000 engineers in Europe to work on the metaverse,\" Haugen said, referring to the company's plans for an immersive online world it believes will be the next big internet trend. \"I was like, `Wow, do you know what we could have done with safety if we had 10,000 more engineers?' It would be amazing,\" she said. It's her second appearance before lawmakers after she testified in the U.S. Senate earlier this month about the danger she says the company poses, from harming children to inciting political violence and fueling misinformation.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Huawei Watch Fit Mini Huawei The Huawei Watch Fit Mini is a smaller version of the original Huawei Watch Fit, and has gone on sale at Amazon. Where\u2019s the mystery here? Huawei watches are usually announced before they head to stores, but the Huawei Watch Fit Mini seems to have skipped that part. The watch is available from Amazon Germany for 99 Euro, roughly $115 in a direct conversion. However, there\u2019s no word of a US release at present. At first glance the Huawei Watch Fit Mini seems like a narrower version of the Watch Fit. It\u2019s only 25.9mm wide, and has a 1.47-inch AMOLED screen of 196 x 368 pixels. The Huawei Watch Fit Mini lacks GPS, though, so will not be as effective a run tracker as its bigger sister. There is also no mentioned of Connected GPS, where the watch takes location information from a connected phone, although other affordable Huawei watches do support this. Neat as the Huawei Watch Fit Mini looks, its positioning is somewhat awkward. The Huawei Watch Fit now tends to sell at well below its original price, making the mini appear less of a good deal that it might otherwise. It has an aluminium front casing, with plastic on the back, and sells with either a brown, purple or white strap. There\u2019s a heart rate sensor on the rear, and 5ATM water resistance means you can wear a Huawei Watch Fit Mini while showering or swimming. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event Its battery lasts up to two weeks, the Watch Fit Mini can check your blood oxygenation through the day and there are 96 exercise modes. The Watch Fit Mini will work with iPhones and Androids, although some specific features like remote camera shutter seem to require a Huawei phone running the company\u2019s EMUI software.",

The tech giant was expected to host yet another hardware event where it was likely to launch a new range of MacBook Air, just like last year. However, as per Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple might not go as expected. According to him, he \u201cwouldn\u2019t expect\u201d a third Apple event this year or \u201cany major announcements\u201d. Instead, Gurman believes that Apple is likely to introduce a new Mac Mini, larger Apple Silicon-powered iMac, iPhone SE3 and new iPad Pro next year. Apple\u2019s upcoming MacBook Air expected features He further reveals that the rumoured MacBook Air is likely to come with a new design and might be powered by Apple\u2019s in-house M2 chip that will launch in the next six to eight months. This model is expected to be the biggest redesign in MacBook Air since 2010. It is likely to come with an increased number of graphics cores paired with the same number of computing cores than its predecessor\u2019s M1 chip. Notably, there are chances that the global chip shortage is the reason behind the delay of the MacBook Air launch. Apple iPhone SE 3 expected features As for iPhone SE 3, a previous report revealed that one of the key highlights of the upcoming iPhone will be 5G support. iPhone SE 3 is expected to offer an iPhone XR-like design that houses a wide notch cut out, but the screen size is likely to be smaller in comparison. It is said to include a 4.7-inch display with Touch ID embedded on to the Home button similar to the predecessor. It might even come with a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, similar to the iPad models. In terms of pricing, the iPhone SE 3 might launch at CNY 3299 in China, which roughly translates to Rs 38,600. In India, it could be priced slightly on the higher side. For the unversed, Apple has launched a new Apple Music plan dubbed the Apple Music Voice subscription plan at the recent Unleashed event. The new plan is priced at $4.99 (approximately Rs 375) globally and will be available in 17 countries, including India this fall. The plan will let users access the full catalog of Apple Music using Siri. The post Apple\u2019s November launch event delayed to 2022: Report appeared first on BGR India.",

The Full Self-Driving (FSD) is optional software that enables a number of autonomous driving features in Tesla cars (though it does not really enabled autonomous driving without driver supervision). The company released it as limited beta software to eligible U.S. drivers in October 2020, causing controversy as some experts feared that this puts other traffic participants at risk. On Saturday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter that there was an issue with \"left turns at traffic lights\" in the 10.3 version of FSD. On Sunday, he followed up by saying that the company is temporarily rolling back FSD to version 10.2. \"This is to be expected with beta software. It is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA, hence public beta,\" he tweeted. It's hard to discern what, exactly, the issues are, and given Tesla has no PR department, we have no one to ask. But The Verge points out that some drivers who tested the FSD 10.3 update have seen phantom forward collision warning (FCW) alerts and a disappearing Autosteer option, among other issues. As Musk puts it, bugs are to be expected with beta software. But when beta software is deployed to actual, real-life drivers on real-world roads, where bugs can cause serious accidents, you have to wonder whether the whole \"beta software on public roads\" idea is the right way to go.",

    "full_description": "DUBAI, U.A.E. \u2014 Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) has developed a small geostationary orbit communications satellite bus intended to provide a low-cost spacecraft with an advanced payload to customers that don\u2019t require a larger satellite. The company announced its Mini Communications Satellite (MCS) design at the 72nd International Astronautical Congress here. The spacecraft, with a mass of 600 to 700 kilograms, is expected to cost less than $100 million, including launch as a rideshare payload. Shlomi Sudri, vice president and general manager of the space division at IAI, said in an interview the company is targeting smaller operators with specific needs for which a larger satellite would be too big and expensive. \u201cNot all customers need the big GEO satellites than weigh around five tons,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tried to see what the sweet spot is for the customer.\u201d That resulted in a much smaller spacecraft with four steerable antennas. However, the spacecraft has a fully digital payload that can provide Ka- or Ku-band services. \u201cThe customer needs to define in the beginning the band, and practically that\u2019s it,\u201d he said, with the payload able to be reconfigured as needed over its 14-year design life. MCS is based on technologies IAI is developing for Dror-1, a communications satellite it is building for the Israeli government under a contract awarded in January 2020 . That includes the digital payload as well as avionics. \u201cA lot of building blocks that we developed for Dror-1 are implemented in this Mini Communications Satellite,\u201d he said, \u201cin order to do as much reuse as we can.\u201d Dror-1 itself is in a \u201cvery advanced state\u201d of design, Sudri said, with most of the components having passed their critical design reviews. \u201cWe anticipate in the coming year we\u2019ll start to integrate the components and subsystems,\u201d he said, but declined to give a schedule for the spacecraft\u2019s launch. IAI has not announced any customers for MCS yet. He said the company focused on maturing the design of the spacecraft before starting to discuss it with potential customers. \u201cWe understand that there is a lot of interest in this small variant,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a couple of customers that we are in negotiation with.\u201d He estimated that the first MCS satellites would be ready for launch two to three years after contract signing. IAI is the latest company to offer a small GEO satellite product. The best known is Astranis, a startup that has secured orders for several of its MicroGEO satellites, including an order for up to eight satellites from Anuvu in July . Sudri declined to compare IAI\u2019s MCS with small GEO satellites from Astranis and others. However, IAI did emphasize in a statement about the new satellite its more than 30 years of experience in satellite development.",

    "full_description": "Apple announced the AirPods 3 alongside the new MacBook Pro variants last week and added another audio product to its audio portfolio. The new AirPods third generation bring a slightly new design to the wireless earbuds along with some new features, bringing its price closer to the AirPods Pro than ever before. So if you\u2019re out looking for a new pair of AirPods to buy, which one exactly should be your pick? Here\u2019s a head-to-head between all the AirPods variants available in India right now to help you figure out which one is for you. We will not be including the first-gen AirPods because Apple no longer sells them via its website. Pricing The AirPods 3 are priced at Rs 18,500 in India, making them more expensive by the AirPods second generation by quite a bit. However, that is still Rs 6,400 less than the price of the AirPods Pro which come in at Rs 24,900 in India. The older AirPods 2 are priced at Rs 12,900. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png Design The AirPods 2 come in a more elongated case shape and the earbuds themselves have plastic heads and no silicone tips, along with longer stems. With the AirPods 3 you still have a plastic head, but with shorter stems and more squarish case. The AirPods Pro come with a squarish case too but feature silicone tips on the earbuds. Also Read | Apple Music Voice Plan: What is it and how do you get it? The AirPods 2 weigh at 4 grams per earbud and 38.2 grams for the case. The AirPods 3 weigh at 4.28 grams per earbud and 37.91 grams for the case. The AirPods Pro weigh at 5.4 grams per earbud and 45.6 grams for the case. Features The AirPods 2 misses out on key features including Spatial Audio, sweat and water resistance and MagSafe charging support. Both the AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro come with these features. The AirPods Pro also packs Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and a transparency mode. The AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro also support for Adaptive EQ, something that the AirPods 2 misses out on. The AirPods Pro features a vent system for pressure equalisation in your ear inside the silicone tips, something not present on (or applicable to) the AirPods 2 and AirPods 3. The AirPods Pro and AirPods 3 also feature a broader range of gesture controls on the earbuds that let you control music playback and calls and trigger Siri compared to the AirPods 2, which has minimal gesture support. Battery Life The AirPods 2 feature up to 5 hours of listening time with a single charge of the earbuds and up to 3 hours for calls. The case gives you a total battery life of about 24 hours and 15 minutes of in-case charging will get you 3 hours of music time and 2 hours of talk time. Also Read | iPhone 14 to AirPods Pro 2: 8 Apple products we\u2019re most excited about in 2022 Coming to the AirPods 3, you get up to 6 hours of music time and 4 hours for calls with a single charge of the earbuds. However, the 6 hours figure can come down to 5 hours if you have Spatial Audio turned on. The case will give you a total battery life of about 30 hours and 5 mins of charging in the case will get you 1 hour of battery life on the buds. With the AirPods Pro, you get 5 hours of music time (4.5 hours with ANC turned on) and 3.5 hours of call time. The case gives you a total battery life of about 24 hours and 5 mins of charging in the case will get you 1 hour of battery life on the buds.

How to use Otter for transcribing audio Click here for more Which AirPods are for you? If you\u2019re looking to buy the most affordable pair of AirPods, the AirPods 2 is your best bet. It should suit most college-goers and basic users who may use it for music and calls and may not need the absolute best call quality and feature support. Meanwhile, the AirPods 3 provides a good balance between pricing and feature, adding support for Spatial Audio, MagSafe and sweat and water resistance, making them ideal for outdoor activities like running in addition to other use cases. They also feature the best battery life between the three products. The AirPods Pro are still the best sounding truly wireless earbuds Apple makes, but they are more expensive and have slightly lesser battery life. However, if ANC support and the silicone-tipped design are important factors to you, you will have to go with the AirPods Pro.",

    "full_description": "The strange metal box hauled from the waves and onto the ship's deck looks like a spaceship fished from a child's imagination. But when scientist Clare Ostle opens it up and draws out the silk scrolls inside, she is looking for the telltale green glow from some of the most important creatures on Earth: plankton . This is a Continuous Plankton Recorder, torpedo-like devices that for 90 years have been towed by merchant vessels and fishing boats on a vast network of routes. They help researchers better understand the ocean by collecting some of its smallest inhabitants. What they have seen is that as climate change heats the seas, plankton are on the move\u2014with potentially profound consequences for both ocean life and humans. Plankton\u2014organisms carried on the tides\u2014are the foundation of the marine food web. But they are also part of an intricately balanced system that helps keep us all alive. As well as helping produce much of the oxygen we breathe, they are a crucial part of the global carbon cycle. \"The big thing that we're seeing is warming,\" Ostle, coordinator of the Pacific CPR Survey, tells AFP as she demonstrates the plankton recorder off the coast of Plymouth in Britain. The CPR Survey has documented a decisive shift of plankton towards both the poles in recent decades, as ocean currents change and many marine animals head for cooler areas. Smaller warm water plankton are also replacing more nutritious cold water ones, often also with differing seasonal cycles, meaning the species that feed on them need to adapt or move too. \"The big worry is when change happens so quickly that the ecosystem can't recover,\" says Ostle, adding that dramatic temperature spikes can lead \"whole fisheries to collapse\". With nearly half of humanity reliant on fish for some 20 percent of their animal protein, this could be devastating. Biological pump Plankton is a catch-all term from the Greek for \"drifting\" and encompasses everything from photosynthesising bacteria many times smaller than the width of a human hair, to jellyfish with long trailing tendrils. There are two main types: phytoplankton, diverse plant-like cells commonly called algae; and zooplankton, animals like krill and the larvae of fish, crabs and other marine creatures. Phytoplankton photosynthesise using the sun's rays to turn C02 into energy and oxygen. In fact, scientists estimate the seas produce around half the oxygen on Earth, and that is mostly thanks to phytoplankton. They are also crucial to the ocean's \"biological carbon pump\", which helps the sea lock away at least a quarter of C02 emitted by burning fossil fuels. While trees store carbon in wood and leaves, phytoplankton store it in their bodies. It passes through the food web, with phytoplankton consumed by zooplankton which, in turn, are eaten by creatures from birds to whales. \"Pretty much everything you can think of in the sea at some stage of its life cycle will eat plankton,\" says CPR Survey head David Johns. When organic matter from dead plankton or their predators sinks to the ocean floor it takes carbon with it. 'Escalating impacts' But scientists warn that climate change has stressed the system, with ocean temperatures rising, fewer nutrients reaching the upper part of the ocean from the deep and increased levels of C02 acidifying seawater. Climate change has \"exposed ocean and coastal ecosystems to conditions that are unprecedented over centuries to millennia with consequences for ocean-dwelling plants and animals around the world,\" says the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in a leaked draft report on climate impacts, due to be published next year, which predicts \"escalating impacts on marine life \". While phytoplankton are relatively resilient and will likely continue to shift territory as the seas warm, the IPCC expects that deteriorating conditions in the oceans will ultimately lead to an overall decline this century. Average global phytoplankton biomass\u2014a measure of total weight or quantity\u2014is predicted to fall by around 1.8 to six percent, depending on the level of emissions. But because of its outsized importance, even modest reductions can \"amplify up the marine food web\", eventually leading to reductions in marine life by roughly five to 17 percent. There could also be \"changes in carbon cycling and carbon sequestration, as our plankton community changes\" with smaller plankton potentially drawing down less C02, says plankton ecologist Abigail McQuatters-Gollop of Plymouth University. As global leaders prepare to meet at a crucial UN summit on climate change, the issue is a stark example of how accelerating human impacts are destabilising intricate life-sustaining systems. Thinking small Tackling this is not as simple as planting trees, McQuatters-Gollop notes. But fishing sustainably, reducing pollutants and curbing C02 emissions can all help improve ocean health. In the past, she says conservation has focused on \"the big things, the cute things, or the things that are directly worth money\"\u2014like whales, turtles and cod. But all rely on plankton. While this \"blindness\" could be because they are microscopic, people can see plankton traces at the beach\u2014in foam on waves, or the nighttime twinkle of bioluminescence. Or on the children's television show \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", whose character Plankton is \"the most famous plankton out there\", says McQuatters-Gollop. And when they \"bloom\" in vast numbers, plankton are visible from space, turning the water a startling emerald, or creating Van Gogh swirls of milky blue, in seasonal displays critical for ocean life. Like land plants, phytoplankton need nutrients like nitrates, phosphates and iron to grow. But they can have too much of a good thing: The runoff of nitrogen-rich fertilisers is blamed for creating harmful algae blooms, like the glutinous \"sea snot\" off Turkey's coast this year. These can poison marine life or choke oxygen out of the water and may be exacerbated by warming, warns the IPCC. Meanwhile, research published in Nature last month found that iron carried in smoke from huge 2019 and 2020 wildfires in Australia sparked a giant swell of phytoplankton thousands of miles away, which could have sucked up substantial amounts of C02. Blooms can be seeded by nutrients from sand storms or volcanic eruptions and it is these \"natural processes\" that have inspired David King, founder of the Centre for Climate Repair at Cambridge. King supports a hotly-debated idea to \"fertilise\" plankton blooms by sprinkling iron on the surface. The theory is that this would not only help suck up more C02, but lead to a surge of ocean life , including eventually helping to increase whale populations that have been devastated by hunting. More whales equals more whale poo, which is full of the nutrients plankton need to bloom, and King hopes could restore a \"wonderful circular economy\" in the seas. A pilot project will try the technique in an area of the Arabian Sea carefully sealed off in a \"vast plastic bag\", but King acknowledges that the idea raises fears of unintended consequences: \"We certainly don't want to de-oxygenate the oceans and I'm pretty confident we won't.\" Sea mysteries Ocean organisms have been photosynthesising for billions of years\u2014long before land plants. But we still have much to learn about them. It was only in the 1980s that scientists named the planktonic bacteria prochlorococcus, now thought to be the most abundant photosynthesiser on the planet. Some \"drifters\" it turns out can swim, while others are masters of communal living. Take the partnership between corals and plankton\u2014it is so important that when it breaks due to warming the corals bleach. Or Acantharea, a single cell shaped like a snowflake that can gather photosynthesising algae and manipulate them into an energy-generating \"battery pack\", says Johan Decelle, of the French research institute CNRS and the University of Grenoble Alpes. They have been \"overlooked\" because they dissolve in the chemicals used by scientists to preserve samples. To study plankton under a high-resolution electron microscope, Decelle used to collect samples at the French coast and drive for hours back to Grenoble with them in a special cool box. But this year he worked with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory on a pioneering project bringing high-tech freezing virtually onto the beach. This enables the study of these delicate organisms as close as possible to their natural environment. By contrast, Continuous Plankton Recorders end up mashing their samples into \"roadkill\", says Ostle. But the value of the survey, which began in 1931 to understand how plankton affected herring stocks, comes from decades of data. Scientists have used it to look back to track climate changes and it played an important role in the recognition of microplastics. Ostle used CPR ships' logs to show that \"macroplastics\" like shopping bags were already in the seas in the 1960s. By the time it was awarded a Guinness World Record last year for the greatest distance sampled by a marine survey, it had studied the equivalent of 326 circumnavigations of the planet. From the boat in Plymouth, the water appears calm as sunlight slides across its surface. But every drop is teeming with life. \"There's just a whole galaxy of things going on under there,\" Ostle says. Explore further \u00a9 2021 AFP",

    "full_description": "Microsoft will show off the Halo Infinite campaign for the first time in over a year this afternoon. A campaign overview video goes live at 2pm UK time. You can watch it in the video below. Watch on YouTube Here's the official blurb: \"The Banished have defeated UNSC forces and taken control of the mysterious Zeta Halo, threatening the survival of humankind. When all hope is lost and humanity's fate hangs in the balance, the Master Chief returns to confront the most ruthless foe he's ever faced. \"Here's a fresh look at the Halo Infinite campaign that introduces players to true Spartan freedom in the biggest, most wide open and adventure-filled Halo experience yet, launching on December 8 2021.\" Halo Infinite was once due out last Christmas, but suffered a high-profile delay after a negative reaction to the last time we saw its campaign in July 2020. The infamous \"Craig\" gameplay demo is below: Watch on YouTube In the video below, Digital Foundry explains more on this demo's graphics: Watch on YouTube 343 had said it was taking this feedback on board, admitting it had \"work to do\" on the graphics . We'll find out how that work has gone at 2pm today. The Halo Infinite campaign was a notable absentee from Gamescom in August . At the time, lead writer Joseph Staten said the team was currently in \"shutdown mode\" as they polished the game for final release on 8th December. \"[Shutdown mode] means we're done with feature work and focused on crushing high-priority bugs,\" Staten said. \"We're spending lots of time playing the game, verifying fixes, and generally doing all we can to ensure campaign (and multiplayer!) plays great on all platforms - from an original, eight-year-old Xbox One to a brand new, ultra-spec PC. This is a very challenging task, even for a large and experienced team. \"[W]e're at a critical phase in the flight that is Halo Infinite, so it's extremely important to avoid distractions and stay focused on mission-critical tasks only. \"For campaign, that means putting maximum effort into ensuring the wide-open, adventure-filled experience you'll all get to play on December 8th is as great as it can possibly be. And gameplay demos and trailers not only take a huge amount of effort to do well, they also take cycles away from bugs and other shutdown tasks.\" Infinite won't have campaign co-op or Forge at launch , unfortunately. The much-loved campaign co-op won't hit the shooter until season two at the earliest, which means about three months after launch. \"We have the opportunity to play campaign all the time,\" Staten said, also in August. \"It's this wonderful, wide open, nonlinear take on a Halo campaign, and it's going to offer so much more flexibility to take down Banished bases from all kinds of different angles, to progress through the game in your own way to a certain extent. \"At the same time though, that's complicated when you think about save systems and all the technology that needs to drive this more nonlinear experience. So, in a co-op scenario that's even more complicated. And that's another reason why it's going to take longer, just to make sure it's quality day-one, and people can jump in and play and have fun.\" While questions about Halo Infinite campaign remain, its multiplayer has gone down really well . Halo Infinite's multiplayer is a standalone free download that goes live alongside the campaign on 8th December. The campaign will be available day on on Xbox Game Pass.",

    "full_description": "Imagine you are going to the supermarket and you pay without your phone or credit card. You only look at a camera, authenticate your identity and then make the transaction. Welcome to the futuristic world of facial recognition payment. This may sound more like something out of a science fiction novel or movie, but this is now possible. The creation of the facial recognition payment systems comes as a direct response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has radically accelerated the shift to biometric contactless payment methods. It is worth noting that this appetite will see the number of users securing payments via software-based facial recognition exceed 1.4 billion globally by 2025 compared to just 671 million in 2020, according to a market report by Juniper Research. Read more | Explained: The push for, and the pushback against, facial recognition technology Contactless payments helped consumers keep safe during the coronavirus -induced pandemic\u2014 as facial recognition payments are taking off, there will be no need to carry a smartphone, bank card, or any form of identification, or even have to enter a pin number. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png How does it work? To make contactless and facial recognition-based payment possible, a Netherland-based company called VisionLabs, recently announced the launch of its pioneering biometric payment hardware \u2014 the VisionLabs LUNA POS Terminal. This payment terminal scans the customer\u2019s face, similar to using facial recognition to unlock a smartphone. Milliseconds later, the face template is sent to the payment service provider or bank for identification. An algorithm then identifies whether the customer is who they say they are, determining transaction success or failure. Read more | Facial recognition spreads, concern over absence of data protection law A facial recognition system has endpoints, which are able to measure certain variables of a person\u2019s face, including the width or length of the nose, space between eyes and depth of eye sockets, and even the contour of the cheekbones\u2014 using this data, a faceprint is created. To make payments using faceprints, every face has to be linked to their bank accounts. This data, is then matched by the payment terminal for authentication purposes. So, instead of paying via cash or through UPI apps, consumers can scan their faces on a screen mounted on the payment terminal and have the money automatically deducted from their linked accounts. \u201cWe introduced our first generation of LUNA POS with no credit card support in 2019 to simply try out the face-based payment process. It quickly turned out that the adoption rate of this technology exceeded our expectations: we have recorded a conversion rate upwards of 40 percent to face payments among different types of major national banks and retailers,\u201d said Anton Nazarkin, Global Business Development Director at VisionLabs. \u2026but is it safe? In the case of facial recognition-based payment technology, several concerns have been raised related to facial recognition software being tricked by scammers, the lack of two-step authentication, and most importantly\u2014 privacy concerns related to the use of faceprints for surveillance purposes. However, VisionLabs believes that is important to remember fraud has a cost to the fraudsters too and it is much more expensive to spoof the face recognition system compared to well-known credit card fraud approaches. \u201cThis is a common belief among some industry experts however that is incorrect for one simple reason: with contactless card payments, there is no way to make sure that the person presenting a card is the actual cardholder. On the contrary, with facial recognition payments the actual identity of the payer is confirmed in real-time,\u201d the company told indianexpress.com . Interestingly, the company also claims that it does not save any facial data and will never capture any faces without consent from the customer and authorisation from the terminal operator.",

So far, Hera has raised a $465,000 (\u20ac400,000) pre-seed round led by Eurazeo (under the Idinvest brand at the time) and several business angels. It has then joined Y Combinator\u2019s S21 batch and raised a $1.7 million seed round led by Eurazeo. Business angels who invested in the company include Alexis Bonillo, Thibaud Elzi\u00e8re, Kyle Parrish, Calvin French-Owen, John Gabaix and Karthik Puvvada. Notion Capital and Kima Ventures also invested. Hera first started as a calendar app focused on note-taking during meetings. Since attending Y Combinator, the product has evolved quite a lot. It is now focused on managing the entire lifecycle of an event for busy people who manage a lot of (virtual) meetings. First, Hera can help you schedule a meeting and get ready for a meeting. In just a few clicks, you can select multiple slots. Hera then generates a friendly text that you can copy and paste in an email thread, in a WhatsApp conversation or wherever you\u2019re talking about your next meeting. This is a much friendlier interface for the person receiving the message compared to traditional meeting scheduling tools. You don\u2019t have to generate a link, and the person on the other end doesn\u2019t have to click on a link to find out when this meeting could take place.

    "full_description": "How can doctors make sure a dressed wound is healing without taking off the bandage? This is a conundrum, because removing a bandage can disrupt the healing process. Technology presented in a new study in open-access journal Frontiers in Physics could help. This new 'smart bandage' contains a sensor that can very sensitively measure wound moisture levels and then transmit the data to a nearby smartphone, without requiring doctors to remove the bandage. In the future, by changing the geometry and materials in the bandage, the researchers may be able to fine tune it to suit different types of wounds . The technology could help doctors to monitor wounds more easily and successfully. Chronic wounds can be a source of significant suffering and disability for patients who experience them. Getting such wounds to heal is tricky and there are many factors that can affect wound healing , such as temperature, glucose levels , and acidity. However, one of the most important is moisture levels. Too dry, and the tissue can become desiccated; too wet, and it can become white and wrinkly, as it does in the bath. Both these situations disrupt the healing process . However, if a doctor wants to check the moisture levels of a wound then they need to remove the bandage, potentially damaging the delicate healing tissue. These issues have inspired this latest smart bandage , as a way to monitor wound moisture levels non-invasively. The choice of materials was a challenge, as bandages need to be biocompatible, disposable and inexpensive. How it works To achieve this, the researchers applied a conductive polymer called poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) onto a gauze using a technique called screen printing , and then incorporated the gauze with commercially available bandage materials. The idea is that changes in the moisture level of the wound cause a change in an electrical signal measured by the sensor. \"PEDOT:PSS is an organic semiconducting polymer that can be easily deposited on several substrates as a standard ink,\" explained Dr. Marta Tessarolo of the University of Bologna, an author on the study. \"We also incorporated a cheap, disposable and bandage-compatible RFID tag, similar to those used for clothing security tags, into the textile patch. The tag can wirelessly communicate moisture level data with a smartphone, allowing healthcare staff to know when a bandage needs to be changed.\" To test their bandages, the researchers exposed them to artificial wound exudate, which is the liquid that seeps from wounds, and also tested different bandage materials and shapes. They found that the bandage was highly sensitive, providing drastically different readings between dry, moist and saturated conditions, suggesting it could be a valuable tool in wound management. \"We developed a range of bandages with various layers and different absorption properties and characteristics,\" said Dr. Luca Possanzini, another author from the University of Bologna. \"The idea is that each type of wound could have its own appropriate dressing, from slowly exuding wounds to highly exuding wounds, such as burns and blisters. However, we will need to further optimize the sensor geometry and determine the appropriate sensor values for optimal healing before we can apply our technology to various types of wounds.\" Explore further",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin API - Application Programming Interface getty Over the course of about a year, a single ethical hacker was able to access millions of patient health records and expose systemic risks in software that are effectively outside the legal jurisdiction of the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). API\u2019s are considered infrastructure (not application) software because they typically work below the application presentation layer as a way to bridge data requests between different (often competing) software applications. The end-user (or consumer) would see the result of an API request in a front-facing application, but not the API itself. \u201cOf the five FHIR API implementations I tested in phase two of my research, three contained pervasive vulnerabilities that allowed me to access over four million patient and clinician records \u2013 often using a single login. The other two were built by Electronic Health Record (EHR) vendors and I found no vulnerabilities in either of them.\u201d Alissa Knight \u2014 Ethical Hacker and Author of \u201cPlaying With FHIR\u201d The white paper, titled \u201cPlaying With FHIR,\u201d is a word play on the underlying specification called Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources \u2013 or FHIR \u2013 which is a kind of blueprint for building API\u2019s used specifically in healthcare. In fact, many of the vulnerabilities Alissa identified were easily avoidable and some of the techniques she used were very basic and in common use by entry level security testers globally. At least some of the vulnerabilities may have been caused by software developers who were overly eager to cash-in on a freshly minted regulation called the \u201cinformation blocking rule.\u201d The new rule went into effect earlier this year and it\u2019s now clear that some developers (either intentionally or out of ignorance) didn\u2019t adhere to critical security specifications that are clearly outlined in the FHIR blueprint. MORE FOR YOU CDC: Salmonella Outbreak Has Left 279 Ill, 26 Hospitalized In 29 States Canadians End Up In ICU After Attending \u2018Covid Party\u2019 White House Mandates Pfizer Vaccines for Millions of Citizens ...Before the FDA Clinical or Safety Reviews Have Been Made Public The basic intent of the new rule (which is exclusive to healthcare) is to threaten incumbent EHR software vendors and providers with penalties if they intentionally \u201cblock\u201d access to their datastore from 3 rd party requests. In reality, however, the rule is really more of a theory because there\u2019s no hard evidence of intentional blocking to date and there are reasons to believe that attempts at enforcing the new rule would be legally challenging \u2013 at best. Why? Because there\u2019s no precedent for this kind of rule (either in healthcare or other industries) so it\u2019s legally novel and untested. Beyond that sizable hurdle, the rule has no less than eight exceptions which can be relatively easy to claim as a viable defense against allegations of data \u201cblocking.\u201d In fact, Alissa\u2019s research may well have undermined the entire rule because one of the eight exceptions is specific to security. With the kind of vulnerabilities she identified, EHR vendors could easily deny (or \u201cblock\u201d) any 3 rd party request for data simply by citing the security exception as their justification \u2013 and their defense would likely succeed based on this one exception alone. I\u2019m not an attorney and I don\u2019t think EHR vendors would hide behind that defense, but given these new risks (and new liabilities), they very likely could. For one thing, no one really knows how many FHIR API\u2019s are in production today \u2014 let alone how many have basic security flaws. Regulations other than \u201cinformation blocking\u201d (most notably HIPAA with detailed protections around the use of personal health information) would not apply because many of the companies developing (or using) these new API\u2019s would not be considered a \u201ccovered entity\u201d or \u201cbusiness associate\u201d and those legal identifiers are the binding requirement for HIPAA\u2019s jurisdiction. \u201c\u2019Playing with FHIR\u2019 highlights how a rapidly expanding ecosystem of consumer- oriented mobile apps and data aggregators may open new security vulnerabilities for patients and healthcare providers. EHR developers and the healthcare organizations they serve follow specific HIPAA requirements to protect health data. But when non-HIPAA regulated entities hold that same data, those requirements fall away. Strong privacy and security protections should extend to anyone who holds patients\u2019 health information.\u201d Judy Faulkner \u2014 CEO & Founder, Epic Given the unusual and unique wording of the \u201cinformation blocking rule,\u201d a cynic could argue that the entire rule was an intentional end-run around HIPAA \u2013 promoted by commercial interests eager to capitalize on lucrative health data (in a host of new directions), but who\u2019s to say? One big takeaway is that Alissa found no vulnerabilities in the two API\u2019s she tested from the EHR vendor community. \u201cCerner believes patients have the right to access their healthcare data in any manner they choose, and Cerner undergoes strict standards to protect data in our systems. However, we share concerns over the lack of consistent regulation of third-party developers. Cerner has been involved in industry and government conversations for years. We believe security and privacy protections should be extended for any entity working with identifiable health information and welcome industry conversation.\u201d David Feinberg \u2014 CEO and President, Cerner There\u2019s no immediate fix because again, the number of FHIR APIs in production today is unknown and opinions vary widely on next steps. \u201cBy CHIME\u2019s estimation, what is needed is a national privacy law that gives consumers protection around how their health data is used when released to third-parties not governed by HIPAA. Further, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) must be adequately resourced to address the burgeoning industry of third-party apps. To date this agency has only received 5 reports of breaches which we know does not represent the true state of things. We applaud the FTC for the recent guidance they issued indicating they will be paying much closer attention to these issues as they explicitly state that third-party are included in the definition of personal health records.\u201d Mari Savickis \u2014 VP, Public Policy at the College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME) Alissa\u2019s research is the kind of sunlight that not only exposes technical vulnerabilities, but also the regulatory failings of government (Congress, HHS, ONC, etc...) to get this first attempt at legislating new access to patient data correct. As it is today, it\u2019s just too easy for developers to avoid the time and considerable cost of securing their API\u2019s. Not all the API\u2019s are vulnerable, of course, but it\u2019s relatively easy to find the ones that are so the proverbial barn door is now wide open to bad actors and the risks to protected health information (PHI) is significant with very limited legal recourse. The final takeaway is this. FHIR is a great standard for APIs in healthcare, but until there is industrial strength certification and binding regulations that assert real penalties, software developers are effectively rewarded for taking the path of least resistance to revenue and the exposure can be measured in the millions of health records. We can\u2019t expect \u2014 nor should we \u2014 voluntary compliance to security with something as critical as personal health information. In the meantime, whatever happens \u2014 or doesn\u2019t \u2014 the advice from Theresa Payton demands everybody\u2019s undivided attention. \u201cCriminals always go where the action is. As API\u2019s continue to be the solution of choice for transformation efforts, the attackers will perfect their tradecraft to attack them and Gartner estimates that by 2022, API attacks will stand out as the most frequent attack method to compromise web applications. If peer reviews and red teaming are not on the top of your priority list now, read Alissa\u2019s research and then reprioritize.\u201d Theresa Payton \u2014 CEO Fortalice Solutions / Former White House CIO / Author of Manipulated",

The latest model still has a large 10.2-inch screen and a retro-style design with thick bezels around the screen and Touch ID on the bottom. You also get 64GB of internal storage (up from 32GB) for the base model, which is a welcome move. The A13 Bionic chipset, which is the same processor that powers the iPhone 11, is still fast and zippy. So, if you are into gaming, streaming video content, want a device for making presentations, or attending classes, this iPad will be a perfect fit. But the real highlight is the 12MP front camera that supports Center Stage, a new feature that uses the front-facing camera to track your face as you move around the frame. Sure, the entry-level iPad comes without a fully laminated display and lacks stereo speakers but that\u2019s not a bummer. This iPad also supports the first-generation Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard. And yes, iPadOS will keep getting updates for 5 years, too. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png Best for getting work done iPad Air 4 (2020) Price: Rs 54,900 onwards Although the iPad Air 4 was launched last year, it is still the most powerful tablet on the market. When lined up against the iPad Pros, the iPad Air 4 looks exactly like them but lacks a 120 Hz ProMotion display, a Face ID sensor (it includes a Touch ID embedded in the power button), and a LiDAR scanner. That being said, there\u2019s a lot to like about the iPad Air. It\u2019s got a 10.9-inch screen, fast A14 Bionic processor, slim edges around the display, a USB-C port and support for the second-gen Apple Pencil and the Magic Keyboard. You also get a pretty solid boost in battery life. The iPad Air 4 is mostly intended to get the work done, be it writing assignments, streaming Netflix, or playing games. It can be used by both students and working professionals. Read our review of iPad Air 4 . Best portable iPad iPad mini (2021) Price: Rs 46,900 The iPad mini isn\u2019t designed to replace the iPhone or iPad Air. Instead, the iPad mini is a dedicated device that\u2019s intended for portable gaming, jotting down notes, or reading eBooks. It has an audience who wish to have a smaller tablet with a nicer screen, a fast chip, better speakers and supports Apple Pencil. The newest iPad mini is essentially a miniature-sized iPad Pro with an 8.3-inch screen and slimmer bezels. It\u2019s powered by the new Apple A15 Bionic chip, the same processor that powers the iPhone 13 series. The tablet also comes with an upgraded 12MP ultra-wide-angle lens with a 122-degree field of view, and that new lens enables a feature called Center Stage. Go for the iPad mini if you want a smaller tablet for things like reading, video calling, and gaming. Read our review of iPad mini 6 . Best tablet for serious work iPad Pro (11-inch, 12.9-inch, 2021) Price: iPad Pro 11-inch \u2014 Rs 71,900 onwards, iPad Pro 12.9-inch \u2014 Rs 99,900 onwards The iPad Pro is a premium tablet aimed at certain users who want the best Apple has to offer. The \u201cpro\u201d in the iPad Pro stands for \u201cprofessional\u201d, and it\u2019s certainly that. Available in 11-inches and 12.9 inches, the iPad Pro is the top iPad in Apple\u2019s line, the one with absolutely every feature available. The 12.9-inch model sports a new Mini-LED display \u2014 the same high-quality display as the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro. The iPad Pro has a USB Type-C port on the bottom, but it\u2019s actually a Thunderbolt port. The premium iPad also supports the Magic Keyboard accessory as well as the second-generation Apple Pencil. These iPad Pro models are also the first to get the M1 chip that powers Apple\u2019s MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. Plus, iPadOS 15 makes the iPad Pro a versatile tablet. Not to forget, these iPad Pros are the only iPad to feature Face ID, a 120-Hz screen refresh rate for smoother scrolling, four speakers for better sound quality, and a lidar sensor for precise augmented reality.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin A Farmer, a Foodie and a Fisher walk into a boardroom\u2026 While it might sound like the beginning of a joke\u2014 it\u2019s actually the fishiest chapter in plant-based food\u2019s most recent brand disruption, featuring a strategy that could just have what it takes to break through the big food glass ceiling\u2014 using plants. But rest assured, people, the planet, and profits all play a central role in this story\u2026 Today Lionel Kambeitz\u2019 and Martin Williams\u2019 vertically integrated, plant-based food company, Above Food, announced a binding transaction agreement with Douglas Hines\u2019 Atlantic Natural Foods (ANF), a global market leader in plant-based seafood alternatives, meals, and egg replacements, adding alternative eggs and seafood to its alternative meat and dairy portfolio of more than forty plant-based food products. (L-R) Lionel Kambeitz \u201cThe Farmer\u201d and Executive Chairman of Above Food, Douglas Hines \"The Fisher\", ... [+] and Chairman of Atlantic Natural Foods and Martin Williams \"The Foodie\" and President and Chief Innovation Officer of Above Food Above Food The deal, valued in excess of $30 million, closely follows Above Food\u2019s other recent acquisitions, including Farmer Direct Organic, Only Oats and Culcherd, and ultimately expands upon its portfolio of plant-based brands across categories. And while Atlantic\u2019s sheer size, influence, global reach, and affordable, delicious and nutritious, shelf stable products make this deal disruptive in and of itself, the vertically integrated and regenerative backdrop adds to this partnership\u2019s truly transformative value. Here\u2019s why. Remember those geographically and logistically complex food supply chains that used to breed a lack of transparency, inflate food prices, create enormous waste, damage soil and wreak havoc on natural ecosystems? Oh wait\u2014 those still exist\u2026 MORE FOR YOU Amid Drought, Billionaires Control A Critical California Water Bank The World\u2019s 1st Ayurvedic Herbal Eatery Blends Ancient Wisdom With Modern Tech Divide And Conquer: How Ross Franklin Turns Pure Green Into A Cold Pressed Juice Empire By Leveraging Leaner Infrastructure And Crowdfunding Well, through its successive acquisitions and partnerships in the plant-based space, and by controlling its tightly synchronised and purpose-driven supply and value chains, Above Food\u2019s \u201cFarmer and Foodie\u201d duo of Kambeitz and Williams is achieving the diversified offering and economies of scale that have typically been relegated to big food companies\u2014 but without all of the bad stuff. In addition to adopting Atlantic\u2019s brand inventory, Above Food plans to integrate ANF\u2019s scaled manufacturing facilities in North Carolina and Thailand into its production ecosystem, adding a deep team of seasoned consumer packaged goods operators, under the leadership of Hines, the organization\u2019s current Chairman. \u201cAbove Food\u2019s seed-to-fork approach in plant-based foods is something we were independently building towards, as we believe owning the entire value chain is the only way to drive the scale of change necessary in the food system and create a true long term business model,\u201d says Hines. Vertical integration is one of the key differentiators in Above Foods\u2019 seed to fork platform\u2014 allowing the brand to offer traceability, affordability and environmental accountability to its customers. And with its great tasting and nutritionally and environmentally responsible products, coupled with the benefits of shelf stability (removing the need for refrigeration) the Above Food-Atlantic deal is a regenerative mike drop in the face of industrial food processes. It also offers the possibility of feeding a growing global population and the food insecure. But let\u2019s venture back to where the very first seed of this idea was sown\u2014 no, not the proverbial seed\u2014 the literal seed. Lionel Kambeitz\u2014 \u201cThe Farmer,\u201d \u201cAg-tech guy,\u201d Co-founder and Executive Chairman of Above Food\u2014 was born and raised on an intergenerational farm in Saskatchewan, Canada. The 70,000 acre regenerative Kambeitz Farm was selected as the North American representative for the Expo Milano in 2015 for sustainable and scalable agriculture, and is what the team refers to as its laboratory, feed lot, fishing fleet and ocean. After all, the meat, the dairy, the eggs and the fish\u2014 the entire alternative protein ecosystem of Above Food\u2014 is grown in no-till soil. The entire alternative protein ecosystem of Above Food (meat, dairy, eggs and fish) is grown in the ... [+] no-till soil of Kambeitz Farm in Saskatchewan, Canada Above Food Now to the fork of the story\u2026 \u201cThe Foodie\u201d and \u201cCPG guy\u201d\u2026 Martin Williams, Co-Founder, President and Chief Innovation Officer of Above Food. Like Kambeitz and Hines, Williams has a highly refined palate for good food and believes in the value of novel plant-based ingredients and \u201cboutique crops\u201d such as faba beans, yellow peas, chickpeas, canary seeds, oats and lentils as animal protein alternatives. With 20 years of experience in Consumer Packaged Goods in innovation, marketing, operations and product development and 12 years advising Fortune 500 CPG companies on innovation and go-to-market strategy, Williams believes in taking custody of all ingredients and steps of production across the supply chain. The true value of this strategy, according to the team, lies in the ability to create better unit economics, unparalleled traceability, superior nutrient density and quantifiable sustainability. \u201cWhen a consumer buys an Above Food branded product, they can guarantee their vote for the environment,\u201d says Kambeitz, who reveals that the brand plans to indicate on its labels, the value in carbon credits associated with each of its products. A huge proponent of environmental accountability, Douglas Hines\u2014 \u201cthe Fisher\u201d and Chairman of Atlantic Natural Foods\u2014 believes that \u201cFeeding the global population sustainably, with high quality nutritious plant-based foods is how we will drive true change to address healthier foods with a healthy planet.\u201d As a former C-level executive at a top-three United States\u2019 canned-tuna brand, Hines is an insider to the unsustainable practices of large food companies and the canned tuna industry in particular, and acquired Atlantic when he left the industry a decade ago. \u201cSeafood people don\u2019t like me,\u201d he says dryly. Available in 25,000-plus retail locations across 30-plus countries, Hines has an unrelenting commitment to mainstream access to ANF\u2019s high quality, sustainably manufactured and nutritious plant based foods. ANF\u2019s plant-based inventory, which includes the Loma Linda brand, America\u2019s oldest plant-based brand, founded in 1890 by Dr. J.H. Kellogg, TUNO, a shelf stable plant-based alternative to canned tuna that offers tuna texture and flavour using plant-based ingredients such as seaweed and DHA algal oil, and Neat, an innovative egg replacer and plant-protein mix brand, successfully builds on Above Food\u2019s vision to enhance its diversity and scale. With its current product offering, Above Food values its market (which includes plant protein ingredients, plant-based meat, plant-based dairy, plant-based snacks, plant-based baby food, plant-based bakery and natural whole grains) at $88.9 billion. In 2022, Above Food will also be launching New Ocean, a complete portfolio of plant-based seafood products that it says will tackle any opportunities and gaps in the category. With its rapid growth, upcoming plans and by scaling healthy, regenerative foods through its vertically integrated operations, Above Food is looking to disrupt the entire food industry, as we know it. Kambeitz, Williams and Hines say that they are now able to advance their vision of getting nutritious, plant-based, shelf stable and affordable foods to \u201call people\u201d and not just the typically \u201chigh end\u201d consumer of specialty vegan and gluten free products. \u201cWe are going beyond Whole Foods WFM , to Dollar Stores and Aldi\u2019s,\u201d says Williams of how Above Food has redefined regenerative and plant-based, making it scalable, affordable, shelf safe and ultimately\u2014 accessible. And with Above Food\u2019s control over the entire supply chain, the brand is also able to offer trust and transparency. Turns out this deal is not that fishy after all.",

    "full_description": "If it\u2019s possible to play it safe with a real-time strategy game in 2021, then Age of Empires 4 is playing it safe. The new game from Relic Studios, taking over from previous franchise developer Ensemble, is more like a modernized remake of Age of Empires 2 than a sequel to the series\u2019 third game. But it turns out that updating a 20-year old classic is actually a pretty great idea. Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games. When we award a game the Polygon Recommends badge, it\u2019s because we believe the title is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive or fun \u2014 and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want to see the very best of the best for your platform(s) of choice, check out Polygon Essentials . In AoE 4 , players select a civilization to play from the eight in the game. Age of Empires 3 transitioned the series into the Colonial age, but AoE 4 returns to medieval times \u2014 just like the second game. Each civilization comes with its own special bonuses and a few unique buildings and units for players to construct. They all start off with a town center and six villagers (up from the three in Age of Empires 2 ), with the goal of building a thriving city, complete with its own economy, and of course, its own army. The game\u2019s main attraction is its competitive mode, which includes duels, team games, or free-for-all warfare with other civilizations, all of which can be played offline against AI or online with other players. To build their cities and armies, players have to gather resources, construct buildings, and create each individual fighting unit, all while trying to counter their enemies\u2019 soldiers. Players can also advance the technology of their cities and armies by constructing special landmarks that move them into a new historical age, with four total to advance through. Building up your cities and their technology is important, but the bread and butter of Age of Empires has always been the armies and combat. Every civilization has access to basic units that form a nice trinity of counters: Spearmen counter cavalry, cavalry counter archers, and archers counter spearmen. This basic premise is ripped right out of Age of Empires 2 (and real life, technically), but the combat, like most things, is a little simpler in AoE 4 . For instance, archers in Age of Empires 4 always hit their targets. While this was an upgrade archers could eventually get in AoE 2 , most small skirmishes in the older game involved moving units to dodge arrows, something that AoE 4 totally eliminates. This simplification extends to more than just the combat. Many of the little issues that used to be part of the chaotic city-management of AoE 2 are gone from the newer game. Players no longer have to reseed their farms as villagers tend them, and villagers rarely get in each other\u2019s way, often just walking right through one another, which makes them far less of a chore to manage. While Age of Empires 4 is still a complicated game, its complications come more from decision-making and strategy than from the minute details of mechanical plays. Civilizations are more different from one another here than they were in Age of Empires 2 \u2014 although the latest game doesn\u2019t go as far as AoE 3 , which gave each civ radically different units and different economic playstyles, mostly through choices of which landmarks you construct at each age. AoE 4 also introduces a few great twists to the base-building formula that allow for more creativity. AoE 2 implicitly encouraged players toward specific city designs because buildings could form makeshift walls around a base. In AoE 4, units can walk around buildings no matter how close together they are, allowing for more freedom of design. The game also introduces production buffs for structures depending on which other buildings are nearby; these bonuses tend to vary from faction to faction, helping the city designs of each one feel unique. This lets players fine-tune their bases and identify with the place they\u2019ve built in a way that AoE 2 just scratched the surface of and Age of Empires 3 mostly abandoned. Adding to the permanence of your city in each match is the fact that defenses in this game are far stronger than they\u2019ve ever been in the series. While walls have always existed in Age of Empires, AoE 4 \u2019s stone walls are a cut above their predecessors. The new stone walls can only be destroyed by siege weapons, rather than by regular soldiers. Infantry units can craft rudimentary battering rams on their own \u2014 once you\u2019ve researched the upgrade for it \u2014 but it still means that sieges require a lot more planning and resource investment than they used to. On top of that, archers can now stand on top of stone walls to gain a small buff. Outside of the game\u2019s staple multiplayer mode, Age of Empires 4 also has an excellent single player mode that features four different historical campaigns. These put players in the shoes of historical generals and armies from four different civilizations at four specific periods in history: The English around the time of the The Anarchy, the Mongols as they invade Russia and China, the Russians with Moscow on the rise, and the French as they face off against the English in The Hundred Years War. Each campaign has several missions, and each mission starts off with a gorgeously filmed and occasionally reenacted historical narration that sets the political and tactical stage for the battle you\u2019re about to play. These scenes are catnip for history buffs, and while they won\u2019t make you an expert on English Civil Wars, they still help each new mission feel like an important part of a larger narrative. The missions themselves are fairly diverse, putting you in situations that standard Age of Empires matches against humans or the AI never would. You\u2019ll face specific challenges, like a requirement to use a specific set of units to take out the enemy, or to lead a tiny force in defending a massive castle from the enemy\u2019s advancing army. Each scenario eventually ends with you killing all the remaining enemies, which can lead to a few of the missions feeling a little same-y by the end, but everything leading up to that is exciting and distinct from the standard multiplayer matches. In the 16 years since the last \u201cnew\u201d Age of Empires game, video games have changed a lot, and in Age of Empires 4 , Relic manages to cater to modern players without losing the soul of the series. The game revives and renovates Age of Empires\u2019 fantastic multiplayer not through fundamental changes, but through clever adjustments to old systems. These minor updates may bristle longtime Age of Empires 2 fans, but they\u2019re a welcome and important addition to the series, making AoE 4 feel like the first big-budget modern RTS since Starcraft 2 . Age of Empires 4 will be released on Oct. 28 on Steam and Xbox Game Pass for PC. The game was reviewed using a pre-release download code provided by Microsoft. Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

Even if you haven't played them, the Age Of Empires games were a pillar of RTS design , and probably the most popular candidate for a comeback since publishers largely abandoned the genre in the 2000s. Let's not argue about which of its elements is the defining one. They're base building, four-resource-gathering contests between factions based on historical world powers, and progress throughout a match happens in explicitly tiered eras that loosely represent historical ages. Age Of Empires 4 has all of that, across four 9-mission single player campaigns, 17 skirmish maps (which can be slightly modified with seed numbers, and we're told more map options are coming), and 8 playable, well-differentiated and slightly unequal civilisations. And I kinda like it. The natural place to start is the campaigns. Each follows one civilisation over a decades long campaign of war and conquest. The usual RTS thing of removing more advanced units from earlier missions applies, and here lines up neatly with the eras and timescale - the Mongols don't have their mega-trebuchet until a few generations have passed in the story and it's actually been invented, for example. Overall, narrative isn't exactly a central concern though. Rather than running through Joan of Arc's life with actors or fictionalising the Norman conquest, each campaign is presented exactly like a certain type of TV documentary , complete with footage of modern cities and landscapes superimposed with animated figures waging wars from long ago. Even the narration is a pitch perfect earnest history voice. It's a very weird vibe, if I'm honest. It's a style of documentary that I personally never quite got on with. By no means bombastic, obnoxious, or patronising, it's still just a little too dramatised for my liking, while also not going full costume drama with it. It wouldn't be fair to slam the game for any of this, though, and I will say in its favour that it's both a novel approach and done with very impressive production values. It probably doesn't help either that because the campaigns cover such a timescale, the documentaries get condensed - and in the case of the Norman conquest one, presents a duly overfamiliar story to anyone who grew up in England. A conqueror arises, fights a few neighbours, and succeeds for a bit. It's hard to get very excited. Fortunately, the missions themselves are strong enough to carry you through (although I gave up on England - and in the game), with the Mongol one in particular doing a decent job of highlighting their strengths and the mindset necessary to make them work. Raid, raid, skirmish, harass and raid is the order of the Khans. Mongol players can move almost all their buildings freely and quickly, and buildings camped around a stone mine can train two units at once. That mine itself is their weakness; you can have only one at a time, and its production can't be sped up with villagers like most other gathering. You can't trade for it either, but you get free stone whenever you destroy enemy buildings, so you'd better make the most of that mobility. The Delhi Sultanate, meanwhile, never pay for research. But they do have to wait a long time for it, making them a natural tech-based side. Each civilisation has enough going on to stand out without straightjacketing the player, and it's clear just from a week's play that people will be unearthing the kind of elaborate tricks and strategies that will make learning a faction's ways a necessity to keep them from being stomped by a nasty surprise in the later eras. In theory, I love the Mongols, but the truth is I'm far too slow for them, and get on much better with the Abbasid, who get anti-cavalry camels. More importantly, though, the Abbasid advance through the eras by simply researching new items from one building. Other factions, see, have to choose and place their advancement buildings, thinking about locations and bonus ranges and space and labour management and defences. The Abbasid plonk their main building down somewhere safe and leave it at that. This suits me well because... okay, look, yes, I'm exactly 4000 years old, but it isn't just that. The series has always involved too much plate spinning for my tastes, and Age Of Empires 4 could be doing more to feel like a strategic challenge rather than a clicking one. It's relentless. Take animals as an example. Sheep and deer (and annoying, but thankfully rare wolves) dot every map, and can be shepherded back to your base by a scout, whereupon villagers can feast upon their precious flesh. You'll want to do this even if just to deny your opponents, but it's a hassle, man. Hunting is worse - deer must be killed and then manually picked up and delivered back to base, one by one. Most factions (notably excluding the Rus, who actually get free gold for doing this, making it even more of a pain) even have to research this first, making the whole thing a massive ballache that really ought to be automated. Maybe that sounds like heresy, but I have better things to do, you know? Villagers could be a little more proactive in repairing and finding something new to do if the berries are all gone, too. And why do I have to manually click on every treasure chest? As for the relics... it's just another thing to deal with on top of ordering more soldiers, then replacing those villagers, moving the archery tent, repairing the dock, and ignoring the notifications because they're basically constant. The game makes no differentiation between \"the archers in front of you are shooting the thing you told them to shoot\", \"your second village is on fire\", or \"your ally's scout has the hiccups\". It's a lot. A lot. Some of you like this, though. This is the whole point of the genre to a fair chunk of players, and to an extent, I accept that. AoE4 offers some keyboard shortcuts too, and a handy breakdown of what your villagers are doing is always ready in the corner. But I still feel like it could use some more options. A way to drag-select military units only. A shortcut for \"select all wounded\". A routine for horse archer harassment that didn't force me to micromanage them so much that I stopped bothering with them entirely. I like that units only pursue enemies a short way before returning (making kiting useful, but limited rather than all-powerful) but I could use patrol options, or engagement radii, or even a \"retreat if x\" routine. The same would help for training and building, too. Yeah, I know, manually replenishing forces is \"How It's Done\", but the way armies enter little formations and scurry about, the unit-specific counters, and particularly the way units yell at each other when they're near enemies all make me want to manage battles and tactics and maneouvres. Instead I've got to click back to the stable and get more lancers, and back to the fishing boats to tell them to search for fish, and back to the barracks to tie the latest recruit's shoelaces. Same as it ever was. More importantly though, I've got better at it. I'll never be an expert, but I've got the hang of knowing when it's time for more houses, when to shift from wood to gold, when I can afford to pump out a constant stream of handgunners. I can see myself getting into this in a way I never quite did with the rest of the series. It helps that it looks and sounds terrific, particularly the siege weapons and the gradual crumbling of buildings and walls (although I still struggle to differentiate between some of the units at distance, not helped by a zoom function that badly needs to stretch further in both directions). But I wince when a lone soldier is caught out by a bombard, I recruit gunners just to enjoy their broadsides, and I love that some units whistle alerts, and the English ring church bells when their towers spot trouble. I'd like to spend more time enjoying those details and less squinting at the minimap (which also badly needs zoom options, or even resizing). Maybe the animations shouldn't matter, but they're the reward to me for successfully destroying a keep, not the completely superfluous levelling system that pops up after every match purely to make me roll my eyes. +40 XP? Sir, this is tetris. I don't feel very strongly about Age Of Empires. That might sound damning, but I'm someone with no particular stake in the series, perhaps even slightly biased against it. Yet I've never wanted to stop playing AoE 4 all week. It might not be a huge step forward, but it's a sure step in a genre whose comeback is long overdue, and it doesn\u2019t appear to have ambitions beyond that. I'd like to see more clear innovation, I'd love an active pause and speed controls in single player at least, and a pull towards macromanagement, and a heap of smaller tweaks that may well come in time anyway. Fundamentally, the best I can say is that I enjoyed it more the better I got, I got steadily better the more I played, and I don't see myself stopping any time soon.",

    "full_description": "What is it? Historical real-time strategy set in the medieval era. Expect to pay $60/\u00a350 (or via Xbox Game Pass) Released October 28, 2021 Developer Relic Entertainment Publisher Xbox Game Studios Reviewed on Ryzen 7 5800H, Nvidia GeForce 3070 (mobile), 16GB RAM Multiplayer? Up to eight players online Link Official site On the evidence of its timeless tyranny over the RTS genre, there\u2019s a case to be made that there\u2019s no surpassing Age of Empires 2\u2014now in its \u2018Definitive\u2019 form. Its competitive scene is thriving, people are lapping up its ongoing DLCs like bread loaves dished out by a benevolent ruler, and its gorgeous sprites have a cleanliness that 3D graphics just can\u2019t quite seem to match. So on the one hand, it makes sense that new series developer Relic has decided to loosely model Age of Empires 4 on the beloved second entry. It strips away some of the complexities of Age of Empires 3, returning to that lovely exploration-economy-conquest loop while adding mostly welcome touches of its own. Chief among these are the asymmetrical factions, which will almost certainly elicit screams of bloody imbalance but nonetheless count as the game\u2019s greatest success. On the other hand, reverence to the past can be restricting, and I can\u2019t help but feel that Age of Empires 4 could have been something more . While I respect Relic\u2019s decision to play things fairly safe, that should result in making what\u2019s already there really shine; polish those mosque minarets and Moscavian onion domes, pump up those population limits, let bodies fly with physics-y abandon upon impact from cannonballs and elephant heads. Instead, there\u2019s a staid utilitarianism throughout much of Age of Empires 4\u2014everything in it works much as it ever did, but without the flair that could have made it a grand celebration of that timeless AoE formula. Those menus make a good first impression though: a triumphant take on the Age of Empires theme explodes in your ears while the golden lines of a medieval world map gleam in the background. Here you have your classic Skirmish mode, of course, as well as four campaigns and a series of Art of War tutorials that time you on various economic and military challenges. Sadly, there are no historical battles, with the several skirmish \u2018presets\u2019 feeling like a poor stand-in for a classic series feature. The campaigns follow the Normans, Mongols, Rus and English across three distinct eras each. Interposed throughout each campaign are crisp documentary-like videos showing footage of significant castles, towns, landscapes and battlefields as they are today, superimposing hundreds of wireframe soldiers over them; the close-up of the Bayeux Tapestry is so detailed that I could practically floss my teeth on its coarse clothy threads. The documentary style permeates into the campaigns themselves, with most of the stories told through a narrator rather than in-game characters. It kind of keeps you at a distance from Genghis and Kublai Khan, Henry I, Ivan the Terrible and the other movers, shakers and razers of medieval history, which is a tad disappointing given Relic\u2019s history of great RTS storytelling with Dawn of War. It does also sometimes feel like the squeaky-clean presentation skirts around the ickier parts of history. To chart decades of Mongol conquests without mentioning the centrality of terror and massacre to their strategy, for instance, seems like a bit of a convenient oversight. Regardless, the campaign throws up plenty of great set-pieces; there\u2019s the Battle of Xiangyang to establish Kublai Khan as Emperor of China, Dmitry Donskoy\u2019s power-shifting defeat of the Mongols at Kulikovo, and over in the west the Battle of Bremule to establish England as a regional power. These missions aren\u2019t easy either, and on standard difficulty I found I had to quickly wrap my fingers around the new keyboard shortcuts to keep up with an efficient, nagging enemy. Damn is it fun to experiment with the different civs and learn their unique ways But these sleek campaigns are just a foreword to the stories you\u2019ll be crafting on the Skirmish maps with the eight eclectic civs on offer. It\u2019s not a huge number, but the visual and strategic variety between these factions is one of the most significant evolutions in the series. Age of Empires 4 might not have the balanced esport appeal of AoE 2, but damn is it fun to experiment with the different civs and learn their unique ways. The Mongols are the biggest wildcard, capable of packing entire towns up into carts and relocating to anywhere on the map. I had a real blast with the Delhi Sultanate too, stomping my hapless AI enemies with War Elephants they had no answer for. Delhi\u2019s use of garrisoned scholars instead of resources to research technologies turns the blacksmith into a kind of persistent research lab ticking along in the background while you get on with other stuff. Even the relatively vanilla English have no less than 10 unique traits, in their case focused largely around agriculture and establishing defensive structure networks that grant speed bonuses to your units. Your strategic path is further refined each time you advance an age, when you get to pick one of two civ-specific landmarks that will advance your empire in different directions. The bulwarky Holy Roman Empire can slam down the Burgrave Palace, for example, capable of producing units in groups of five, while the Rus High Trade House generates its own deer, feeding into the Rus bounty mechanic through which they earn gold by hunting. A couple of the civs even have their own twists on age advancement. The Abbasids add wings onto their House of Wisdom instead of erecting new landmarks, while the Chinese can build two landmarks per age and found dynasties which will grant you different bonuses for the rest of the game. You can even \u2018build tall\u2019, with Abbasids and the Holy Roman Empire gaining bonuses based on buildings you place near their central structures. While the core mechanics and loops will be familiar, the carefully designed civs and age-advancement choices offer an intricate new web of strategies and approaches to each match. It\u2019s Relic\u2019s bravest evolution of that precious AoE formula, and it really diversifies the game even though wide-scale online play will probably reveal tons of balancing issues over the coming months. But hey, that\u2019s all part of the process in a series where a single title can be improved and iterated over many years. Upon starting a new game, returning players will immediately settle into the rhythm of resource-gathering, villager spamming, scouting and outrageous forward-settling (particularly effective with the nomadic Mongols). Victory conditions have been smoothed out to keep matches pacey, with military conquest now only requiring you to destroy an enemy\u2019s landmarks, the number of which increases with each age. For a religious victory, you can no longer take relics back to the safety of your base, but instead have to hold onto all the Sacred Sites on a map for 10 minutes. Given their central locations on maps, this should encourage more feisty strategies than the sneaky relic-hoarding of AoE past. But all you defensive-minded turtles out there needn\u2019t worry: the Wonder victory\u2014whereby you build a late-game wonder and hold it for 10 minutes\u2014still exists. Sieges feel much better thanks to the ability of infantry units to create battering rams and siege towers. It does wonders for the pacing that you no longer have to guide your rams and gangly siege towers across an entire map, and it feeds into the freshly scalable stone walls too. Sadly, I\u2019m yet to find the full strategic benefits of siege towers as opposed to smashing walls down with trebuchets from a safe distance. Positioning soldiers on walls defensively, on the other hand, offers increased sightlines, and I shamelessly exploited this against the AI by building stone walls right up in their business, picking off key economic buildings with wall-mounted archers. Finally, the ability to quickly rotate and position unit groups on an axis is great for battle micromanagement, letting you set up defensive positions or proper army formations more elegantly than before. These aren\u2019t huge changes, but they all help the combat feel that bit cleaner. Despite a single 30-minute game of Age of Empires ostensibly spanning decades of technological progress, the series has never really evoked the sense of time passing; for all I knew from playing the original AoE, Rome really was built in a day. Age of Empires 4 addresses that dissonance with a few discerning touches. When you plunk down buildings, for instance, you see sped-up wireframe outlines of builders popping up at different points around the construction site\u2014a bit like old stop-motion footage of a skyscraper being erected. Each civ has its own soundtrack too, which mixes in beautifully from the menu music and evolves throughout the ages. They\u2019re little things that increase the grandness of your condensed journey, ironically in a game that actually seems to be a little bit faster than its predecessors. And yet, for every thoughtful tweak and feature there\u2019s an equal and opposite misstep holding Age of Empires 4 back from greatness, because god forbid it outshines the immortal second entry. Building and ground textures are on the washed-out side (and nope, I won\u2019t accept explanations that this is just part of the game\u2019s more \u2018painterly\u2019 art style). Having gone back to Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition for comparison, I found that not only are textures cleaner there, but the game is more secure about showing them off by letting you zoom in further. For every thoughtful tweak and feature there\u2019s an equal and opposite misstep holding Age of Empires 4 back from greatness Speaking of zoom, the combination of high camera angle and limited zoom-out makes for quite a narrow field of view. I\u2019d love to have seen some kind of free camera functionality that lets you admire your town planning and get into the nitty-gritty of battles, or at least the option for a classic isometric perspective. And battles still feel too polite , as units and cavalry charge each other only to stop just short of collision and start jabbing at each other with their pokey-sticks\u2014it\u2019s kind of alarming that I still have to refer back to 2004\u2019s Battle for Middle-Earth as an example of \u2018cavalry collisions done good\u2019. Units in vague proximity to enemy war elephants seem to drop dead, and there\u2019s no dynamism when castle walls fall out from under units or bombards blow troops away. Similarly, keeping population caps to the traditional 200 means that battles never really reach the grand scale the trailers tease you with (unless orchestrated by the campaign). But perhaps what I think of as anachronism others will think of as purism; a game zealously keeping to an excellent formula, right down to its strangely civil combat, and non-existent horse-turning animations that look a bit like a carousel pony rotating loosely on its axis. The fact remains that the strong AoE loop, ever so slightly refined, is as compelling as ever, spruced up by a colourful roster of truly distinct civs. Knowing how unique each faction is makes the inevitable introduction of new ones a tantalising prospect. Age of Empires 4 has strong foundations to really grow into something, but it comes at a time when Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition is adding long-desired co-op campaigns and an ever-expanding library of historical battles. By comparison, Age of Empires 4 looks a little content-thin, especially for a \u00a350 game (conversely, it\u2019s an absolutely glorious day one release on Xbox Game Pass). Relic told us last month that they weren\u2019t looking to steal AoE 2\u2019s player base or place at the top of the series hierarchy, but rather give players an interesting new alternative. In this sense I guess they\u2019ve succeeded, but it feels like with a bit more attention to detail (rather than, say, hours of globe-trotting documentary footage), they could have heralded a new AoE era rather than invoking a past one. But in a series where a single game can manifest into its best form years, even decades, later, and the only thing really standing in the way of Age of Empires 4\u2019s growth is the ongoing success of its predecessors. It offers enough new ideas amidst the sturdy old foundations to rank among them\u2014even if it\u2019s not yet ready to rule.",

    "full_description": "A year ago, Tara Jones, an Amazon warehouse worker in Oklahoma, cradled her newborn, glanced over her pay stub on her phone and noticed that she had been underpaid by a significant chunk: $90 out of $540. The mistake kept repeating even after she reported the issue. Jones had taken accounting classes at community college, she grew so exasperated that she wrote an email to Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s founder. \u201cI\u2019m behind on bills, all because the pay team messed up,\u201d she wrote weeks later. \u201cI\u2019m crying as I write this email.\u201d Unbeknown to Jones, her message to Bezos set off an internal investigation, and a discovery: Jones was far from alone. For at least 1 1/2 years \u2014 including during periods of record profit \u2014 Amazon had been shortchanging new parents, patients dealing with medical crises and other vulnerable workers on leave, according to a confidential report on the findings. Some of the pay calculations at her facility had been wrong since it opened its doors over a year before. As many as 179 of the companies\u2019 other warehouses had potentially been affected, too. Explained | SIAC ruling in Future Retail-Reliance Retail deal, and how it gives Amazon a boost Amazon is still identifying and repaying workers to this day, according to Kelly Nantel, a company spokesperson. That error is only one strand in a long-standing knot of problems with Amazon\u2019s system for handling paid and unpaid leaves, according to dozens of interviews and hundreds of pages of internal documents obtained by The New York Times. Together, the records and interviews reveal that the issues have been more widespread \u2014 affecting the company\u2019s blue-collar and white-collar workers \u2014 and more harmful than previously known, amounting to what several company insiders described as one of its gravest human resources problems. Workers across the country facing medical problems and other life crises have been fired when the attendance software mistakenly marked them as no-shows, according to former and current human resources staff members, some who would speak only anonymously for fear of retribution. Doctors\u2019 notes vanished into black holes in Amazon\u2019s databases. Employees struggled to even reach their case managers, wading through automated phone trees that routed their calls to overwhelmed back-office staff in Costa Rica, India and Las Vegas. And the whole leave system was run on a patchwork of programs that often did not speak to one another. Some workers who were ready to return found that the system was too backed up to process them, resulting in weeks or months of lost income. Higher-paid corporate employees, who had to navigate the same systems, found that arranging a routine leave could turn into a morass. In internal correspondence, company administrators warned of \u201cinadequate service levels,\u201d \u201cdeficient processes\u201d and systems that are \u201cprone to delay and error.\u201d The extent of the problem puts in stark relief how Amazon\u2019s workers routinely took a back seat to customers during the company\u2019s meteoric rise to retail dominance. Amazon built cutting-edge package processing facilities to cater to shoppers\u2019 appetite for fast delivery, far outpacing competitors. But the business did not devote enough resources and attention to how it served employees, according to many longtime workers. \u201cA lot of times, because we\u2019ve optimized for the customer experience, we\u2019ve been focused on that,\u201d Bethany Reyes, who was recently put in charge of fixing the leave system, said in an interview. She stressed that the company was working hard to rebalance those priorities. The company\u2019s treatment of its huge workforce \u2014 now more than 1.3 million people and expanding rapidly \u2014 faces mounting scrutiny. Labor activists and some lawmakers say that the company does not adequately protect the safety of warehouse employees, and that it unfairly punishes internal critics. This year, workers in Alabama, upset about the company\u2019s minute-by-minute monitoring of their productivity, organized a serious, although ultimately failed, unionization threat against the company. In June, a Times investigation detailed how badly the leave process jammed during the pandemic, finding that it was one of many employment lapses during the company\u2019s greatest moment of financial success. Since then, Amazon has emphasized a pledge to become \u201cEarth\u2019s best employer.\u201d Andy Jassy, who replaced Bezos as CEO in July, recently singled out the leave system as a place where it can demonstrate its commitment to improve. The process \u201cdidn\u2019t work the way we wanted it to work,\u201d he said at an event this month. Explained | Proposal for anti-conversoon bill \u2018unnecessary, arbitrary\u2019 In response to the more recent findings on the troubles in its leave program, Amazon elaborated on its efforts to fix the system\u2019s \u201cpain points\u201d and \u201cpay issues,\u201d as Reyes put it in the interview. She called the erroneous terminations \u201cthe most dire issue that you could have.\u201d The company is hiring hundreds of employees, streamlining and connecting systems, clarifying its communications and training human resources staff members to be more empathetic. But many issues persist, causing breakdowns that have proved devastating. This spring, a Tennessee warehouse worker abruptly stopped receiving disability payments, leaving his family struggling to pay for food, transportation or medical care. \u201cNot a word that there had ever been a problem,\u201d said James Watts, 54, who worked at Amazon in Chattanooga for six years before repeated heart attacks and strokes forced him to go on disability leave. The sudden loss of his benefits caused a cascade of calamities: Because he was without pay for two weeks, his car was repossessed. To afford food and doctors\u2019 bills, Watts and his wife sold their wedding rings. \u201cWe\u2019re losing everything,\u201d he said. The benefits restarted without explanation several months later, but the couple are still struggling to regain their footing. Nantel said that Amazon regretted Watts\u2019 situation, that the process was too confusing and that it was working to simplify the process of navigating leaves. As the country\u2019s second largest private employer, Amazon offers a wide array of leaves \u2014 paid or unpaid, medical or personal, legally mandated or not. While Amazon used to outsource the management of its leave programs, it brought the effort in-house when providers could not keep up with its growth. It is now one of the largest leave administrators in the country. Employees apply for leaves online, on an internal app, or wade through automated phone trees. The technology that Amazon uses to manage leaves is a patchwork of software from a variety of companies \u2014 including Salesforce, Oracle and Kronos \u2014 that do not connect seamlessly. That complexity forces human resource employees to input many approved leaves, an effort that last fall alone required 67 full-time employees, an internal document shows. Reyes said a permanent bridge between the programs is scheduled to be completed in March, with incremental improvements in the meantime. Top News Right Now UP to soon become India's medical hub: PM Modi in Siddharthnagar Kashmiri students 'attacked' in Punjab colleges after India vs Pak match Hate speech findings in India led to deeper analysis: Facebook Click here for more Current and former employees involved in administering leaves say that the company\u2019s answer has often been to push them so hard that some required leaves themselves. Last year, in an email sent out on a Friday about a Sunday deadline, a corporate manager of the leave system scolded his teams to do more. \u201cYou all know what needs to be accomplished and by when,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNo exceptions!\u201d Reyes said that employee burnout was a huge concern of hers as she was taking on her new role and that she was trying to address it in several ways. Amazon\u2019s own teams have not always been well-versed in the system, internal documents show. An external assessment last fall found that the back-office staff members who talk with employees \u201cdo not understand\u201d the process for taking leaves and regularly gave incorrect information to workers. In one audited call, which dragged on for 29 minutes, the phone agent told a worker that he was too new to be eligible for short-term disability leave, when in fact workers are eligible from their first day. Reyes said that with improved training, her teams could now resolve more than nine out of 10 issues on the first call. In some cases, Amazon has been accused of violating the law. In 2017, Leslie Tullis, who managed a subscription product for children, faced a mounting domestic violence crisis and requested an unpaid leave that employers must offer under Washington state law to protect victims. Once approved, Tullis would be allowed to work intermittently; she could be absent from work as much as necessary, and with little notice; and she would be protected against retaliation. Amazon granted the leave, but the company did not seem to understand what it had said yes to. It had no policy that corresponded to the law of the company\u2019s home state, court documents show. Tullis said she spent as many as eight hours a week dealing with the company to manage her leave. At one point, she was moving regularly to keep her children safe. Despite the legal protections, her bosses would become visibly frustrated when she was behind on work, \u201clike I was betraying them every day,\u201d she said. In June 2019, after she took two days of leave to deal with the latest emergency in a continuing family crisis just before a performance plan was due, she was fired for missing the deadline by two days. The Washington state attorney general\u2019s office took up her case, calling Amazon\u2019s leave reporting system \u201ca failure\u201d and arguing that the company retaliated in violation of the state law. Amazon is fighting the case. Nantel said the company gave Tullis flexibility and support, as well as the equivalent of about seven months of unpaid leave over two years. She said Tullis was fired not in retaliation but because her performance faltered while she was not on leave. Just before she was dismissed, she emailed her manager, stunned that the deadline was not pushed back to accommodate the exact type of crisis the leave law was intended to protect. \u201cDomestic violence is a series of emergencies,\u201d Tullis wrote in an email, \u201cand the victims don\u2019t get to pick when it ends.\u201d",

    "description": "Sudan\u2019s army has dissolved the government and declared a state of emergency in what amounts to a military coup after months of tension between the civilian and military wings of the transitional ruling body. The military takeover, which prompted people to take to the streets of the capital Khartoum in protest, was announced on television on Monday by Gen Abdel Fattah Burhan, chair of the sovereign council that had been overseeing the transitional government. Soldiers killed at least three protesters and wounded 80 in clashes that followed, Reuters reported. Gen Burhan said the armed forces had taken control but would appoint a technocratic government as well as a constitutional court and a legislative council. The military would prepare the country for elections in July 2023, he said. Hours earlier, the culture and information ministry said in a Facebook post that the armed forces were holding prime minister Abdalla Hamdok and other political figures. It said in a later post that Gen Burhan \u201cannounced the seizure of power in a military coup\u201d. The transitional government came into power in 2019 after months of civilian protests against the 30-year regime of Omar al-Bashir. Although protesters and civilian officials referred to the toppling of Bashir as a \u201crevolution\u201d, it was the military that ultimately brought his regime to an end. In recent months, the loose coalition of forces that helped topple Bashir has fractured as economic hardship bites, with inflation running at nearly 200 per cent. Nabil Adib, a prominent human rights lawyer in Khartoum, said there had been a breakdown in relations between the military and civilians. \u201cThere are divisions and differences of opinion and internal problems,\u201d he said, referring to splits within the broad coalition of civilian forces, many over the direction of economic policy. A statement from Mr Hamdok\u2019s office posted by the culture and information ministry on its Facebook page, which managed to circumvent an internet blockade, said the prime minister was \u201ckidnapped\u201d and called on the \u201cSudanese people to come out and demonstrate using all peaceful means possible ... to take back their revolution from these thieves\u201d. \u201cMilitary forces fired live bullets at demonstrators who rejected the military coup,\u201d said the ministry, which is loyal to Mr Hamdok, after protesters flocked to the streets of Khartoum. At least 12 people have been injured in clashes, according to the Sudan Doctors Committee trade union. US \u2018alarm\u2019 The military takeover, which happened in the early hours of Monday not long after US special envoy for the Horn of Africa Jeffrey Feltman left Khartoum, was condemned by the international community. In a statement on Monday, the US government said it was \u201cdeeply alarmed\u201d by the development, which would contravene \u201cthe democratic aspirations of the Sudanese people and is utterly unacceptable. As we have said repeatedly, any changes to the transitional government by force puts at risk US assistance\u201d. Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairman of the African Union Commission, called for the \u201cimmediate resumption of consultations between civilians and the military\u201d and urged the release of all \u201carrested political leaders\u201d. French president Emmanuel Macron said \u201cFrance condemns the attempted coup in Sudan in the strongest terms\u201d, while EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell demanded that both sides \u201cput back on track the transition process\u201d. The culture and information ministry said on Monday that internet services had been cut off from mobile phone networks and bridges were closed by military forces.

    "full_description": "Sudan\u2019s army has dissolved the government and declared a state of emergency in what amounts to a military coup after months of tension between the civilian and military wings of the transitional ruling body. The military takeover, which prompted people to take to the streets of the capital Khartoum in protest, was announced on television on Monday by Gen Abdel Fattah Burhan , chairman of the sovereign council that had been overseeing the transitional government. A health ministry official said seven people were killed by gunfire and 140 injured in clashes between soldiers and street protesters. Gen Burhan said the armed forces had taken control but would appoint a technocratic government as well as a constitutional court and a legislative council. The military would prepare the country for elections in July 2023, he said. Hours earlier, the culture and information ministry said in a Facebook post that the armed forces were holding prime minister Abdalla Hamdok and other political figures. It said in a later post that Gen Burhan \u201cannounced the seizure of power in a military coup\u201d. The transitional government came into power in 2019 after months of civilian protests against the 30-year regime of Omar al-Bashir. Although protesters and civilian officials referred to the toppling of Bashir as a \u201crevolution\u201d, it was the military that ultimately brought his regime to an end. In recent months, the loose coalition of forces that helped topple Bashir has fractured as economic hardship bites, with inflation running at nearly 200 per cent. Nabil Adib , a prominent human rights lawyer in Khartoum, said there had been a breakdown in relations between the military and civilians. \u201cThere are divisions and differences of opinion and internal problems,\u201d he said, referring to splits within the broad coalition of civilian forces, many over the direction of economic policy. A statement from Mr Hamdok\u2019s office posted by the culture and information ministry on its Facebook page, which managed to circumvent an internet blockade, said the prime minister was \u201ckidnapped\u201d and called on the \u201cSudanese people to come out and demonstrate using all peaceful means possible . . . to take back their revolution from these thieves\u201d. \u201cMilitary forces fired live bullets at demonstrators who rejected the military coup,\u201d said the ministry, which is loyal to Mr Hamdok, after protesters flocked to the streets of Khartoum. The military takeover, which happened in the early hours of Monday not long after US special envoy for the Horn of Africa Jeffrey Feltman left Khartoum, was condemned by the international community. In a statement on Monday, the US government said it was \u201cdeeply alarmed\u201d by the development, which would contravene \u201cthe democratic aspirations of the Sudanese people and is utterly unacceptable.

Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairman of the African Union Commission, called for the \u201cimmediate resumption of consultations between civilians and the military\u201d and urged the release of all \u201carrested political leaders\u201d.

However, the iPod wasn't always so pocket-sized and easy to carry around. Apparently it was once the size of a grocery store slab cake. App developer Panic has revealed images of an original, early Apple iPod prototype, and it looks more like a paving brick than a portable media player. While you could still technically carry this sizable device around on your commute, it would not be comfortable and people would definitely stare. Panic published the images in a blog post on Saturday to mark the 20th anniversary of the first iPod's release on Oct. 23, 2001 . Judging from the photos, Apple's cumbersome prototype appears around three times the size of the actual iPod that went to market, making it roughly 12.06 by 7.29 inches. It could probably double as a self-defence tool though, so there is that. iPod's custardy granddaddy was probably light enough to swing, too. Panic cracked the embryonic iPod open to poke at its guts, revealing a significant amount of free real estate inside the gargantuan prototype. It'd be a fair guess that Apple was more focused on finalising circuitry than size at this point in development. \"Clearly, this revision of the prototype was very close to the internals of the finished iPod,\" writes Panic. \"In fact, the date [affixed to the internal circuitry] \u2014 September 3rd, 2001 \u2014 tells us this one was made barely two months before it was introduced.\" Head over to Panic for a peek the big guy's innards.",

    "full_description": "Frances Haugen first met Jeff Horwitz, a tech-industry reporter for The Wall Street Journal, in early December on a hiking trail near the Chabot Space & Science Center in Oakland, California. She liked that he seemed thoughtful, and she liked that he had written about Facebook \u2019s role in transmitting violent Hindu nationalism in India, a particular interest of hers. She also got the impression that he would support her as a person, rather than as a mere source who could supply him with the inside information she had picked up during her nearly two years as a product manager at Facebook. \u201cI auditioned Jeff for a while,\u201d Haugen told me in a phone interview from her home in Puerto Rico, \u201cand one of the reasons I went with him is that he was less sensationalistic than other choices I could have made.\u201d She became one of the greatest sources of the century, turning over the tens of thousands of pages of internal documents she had collected. Starting Sept. 13, the Journal justified her confidence with a meticulous rollout that included 11 major articles by Horwitz and other reporters cleverly packaged under a catchy rubric, The Facebook Files. Key revelations included how Facebook executives handled politicized lies, including Donald Trump\u2019s claims of election fraud. Often, the company chose to let misinformation spread widely, to keep more people logging on. The series also noted the lengths that Facebook went to in its desperation to hang on to its audience as young people drifted away from its platforms. Read | Findings on hate speech, misinformation in India led to deeper analysis, says Facebook The Journal also produced a podcast episode introducing Haugen as poised, incisive and intensely moral, a depiction that Horwitz told me he agrees with after much reporting, but which also amounted to white-glove treatment of a treasured source. So there was an uncomfortable moment Oct. 7, when a communications firm working with Haugen invited Horwitz and two of his editors to a Zoom call with a group that would grow to include journalists from 17 other U.S. media outlets. On the call, Haugen offered to share redacted versions of the trove of Facebook documents under an embargo to be set by the group. The firm, founded by former Barack Obama aide Bill Burton, would help manage the process. After she made her pitch, Horwitz and his colleagues found themselves in a strange position: The source who had provided them with the stuff of so many exclusive scoops now seemed to be going rogue. \u201cThis is a little awkward,\u201d Jason Dean, an editor at the Journal, said on the call, according to three participants. The Journal team left before the call was over. Since then, journalists at The Atlantic, The Associated Press, CNN, NBC News, Fox Business and other outlets, including The New York Times, have been poring over the first tranche of Haugen\u2019s documents, along with a parallel group in Europe, with a plan to publish their findings Monday (although stories began trickling out Friday night). We live in a time of megaleaks, enabled by the same digital technology that allows us to surveil one another and document our lives as never before. These leaks have given the leakers and their brokers a new kind of power over the news media, raising tricky questions about how their revelations should enter the public sphere. There are questions, in particular, on the balance of power between the sources of vital information and the reporters who benefit from them. Some leaks, including U.S. military and State Department files, emerged on WikiLeaks or nameless servers in the form of massive data dumps; others, including Edward Snowden\u2019s National Security Agency files and The Intercept\u2019s revelations of America\u2019s drone wars, came about after journalists had gained sources\u2019 trusts. Read | Findings on hate speech, misinformation in India led to deeper analysis, says Facebook Reports on the Panama Papers , based on the leaking of more than 11 million documents, and other examinations of global tax evasion that followed it were brokered through the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which managed a collaboration among hundreds of journalists around the world. They read the documents, as well as one another\u2019s stories, on a secure server before coordinating the rollout of their articles on social media. In some cases, the leaker or hacker seems to be the one who controls how and when information is released. That\u2019s how it went in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, when a Kremlin-directed cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee led to the devastatingly timed publication of the committee\u2019s private documents on WikiLeaks. In other instances, a key source may yield to a unified group of journalists \u2014 at the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists or elsewhere \u2014 who add layers of reporting and analysis to the raw material. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford to have the source dictate the story,\u201d Gerard Ryle, director of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, said in an interview. Haugen chose a middle path, one that appears to have captured the best of both arrangements, from her perspective, while also foiling Facebook\u2019s attempts to contain the story. First, she handed her documents to the Journal for a boutique rollout. Then she opened the journalistic equivalent of an outlet store, allowing reporters on two continents to root through everything the Journal had left behind in search of overlooked informational gems. Her intention was to broaden the circle, she said. She added that she plans to share the documents with academic writers and publications from parts of the world where she sees the greatest peril, including India and parts of the Middle East. \u201cThe reason I wanted to do this project is because I think the global South is in danger,\u201d she said. With this model, Haugen and her advisers have created a new kind of journalistic network, one that has stirred mixed feelings among the journalists involved. In the past two weeks, they have gathered on the messaging app Slack to coordinate their plans \u2014 and the name of their Slack group, chosen by Adrienne LaFrance, executive editor of The Atlantic, suggests their ambivalence: \u201cApparently We\u2019re a Consortium Now.\u201d Inside the Slack group, whose messages were shared with me by a participant, members have reflected on the strangeness of working, however tangentially, with competitors. (I didn\u2019t speak to any Times participants about the Slack messages.) \u201cThis is the weirdest thing I have ever been part of, reporting-wise,\u201d wrote Alex Heath, a tech reporter for The Verge. In an interview, Brian Carovillano, head of investigations for The Associated Press, said, \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable to see these news organizations, large and small, set aside some of their competitive impulses and work together to report out a story that is unquestionably in the public interest.\u201d Read | Australian regulator \u2018concerned\u2019 about Facebook\u2019s approach to media law The Slack group has also discussed news outlets that are not part of the consortium, including The Information. (In an article published Friday about Haugen\u2019s media strategy, The Information reported that it had asked to join the group, \u201cbut was told by one participant that it was not accepting new members.\u201d) The Guardian, which won a Pulitzer Prize in public service in 2014 for its reports on secret surveillance by the National Security Agency \u2014 a series made possible by Snowden\u2019s leaks \u2014 was another publication that got left out. Haugen told the participants that she felt the Journal could have published more articles on the documents she provided, especially on Facebook\u2019s effect on nations where English is not the main language. The polished rollout, including Haugen\u2019s Oct. 3 appearance on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and congressional testimony days later, has led to dark hints from Facebook and its allies that there is something a little too good to be true about her. The Journal\u2019s right-wing editorial page accused her of seeking to censor political speech, writing that it was \u201cnotable that her appearance seems to have been midwifed by Bill Burton, a prominent Democratic communications executive.\u201d A Facebook executive tweeted preemptively to suggest that the embargo could amount to an \u201corchestrated \u2018gotcha\u2019 campaign.\u201d I haven\u2019t found anything to suggest that there is more, or less, than meets the eye to Haugen, a high school debater who had worked at Google and Pinterest before joining Facebook in 2019. \u201cThere is zero evidence whatsoever in my mind of any other entity being involved,\u201d Horwitz told me. Top News Right Now Hate speech findings in India led to deeper analysis: Facebook Kashmiri students 'attacked' in Punjab colleges after India vs Pak match Zia Mustafa killing all but pulls curtain down on Nadimarg Pandit massacre Click here for more Lawrence Lessig, the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, who volunteered as her lawyer, said he had brought in Burton, the former Obama aide, in September, after the Journal\u2019s reporting was underway. Haugen, in our phone interview, also resolved a minor mystery: whether she\u2019s quietly relying on the financial support of Pierre Omidyar, an eBay co-founder whose groups started working with her in October, as Politico first reported. The reality, she said, is that she has her own financial resources, and has accepted help from nonprofit groups backed by Omidyar only for travel and similar expenses. \u201cFor the foreseeable future, I\u2019m fine, because I did buy crypto at the right time,\u201d she told me. She noted that she had moved to Puerto Rico to cope with a health condition \u2014 but also to join her \u201ccrypto friends\u201d on the island, whose capital-gains tax exemptions have made it a hub for that novel financial system. (Burton said he was initially working without pay but is now being paid by donors, including the nonprofit groups backed by Omidyar.) When I began reporting this column, I thought the central question would be whether Haugen\u2019s tactics had allowed her to control the story, and whether journalistic collaboration had bled into groupthink. But although a glance at Twitter shows that journalists on any beat can slip into a herd mentality, there\u2019s little evidence that this leak, with its trove of documentary detail, had deepened that tendency. Competitive pressures have remained close to the surface. The Journal suggested other outlets stick with its \u201cFacebook Files\u201d branding, but the Times\u2019 Mike Isaac wrote in the Slack group that using that phrase would be \u201cfree advertising for the Journal series,\u201d prompting Casey Newton of the newsletter Platformer to suggest going with \u201cThe Leftovers.\u201d Most outlets settled on \u201cThe Facebook Papers.\u201d By Friday night \u2014 Black Friday at the information mall, so to speak \u2014 the Slack group was falling apart. Another Times reporter had dropped in late that afternoon with a \u201cheads-up\u201d: The Times would be publishing an article on Facebook\u2019s conduct in the run-up to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol based \u2014 he assured his rivals \u2014 on \u201cdocuments we got before the formation of the consortium.\u201d It seemed to many others to be within the letter of their agreement, but also an attempt by the Times to get ahead of competitors who hadn\u2019t obtained the documents separately. \u201cMy thought is, if you are a reporter who had these docs, maybe it would have been cooler to not be part of the consortium, rather than run down the clock,\u201d NBC News\u2019 Brandy Zadrozny fumed in the Slack group. After NBC News responded to the Times\u2019 move by breaking the embargo with its own Facebook article, Zadrozny apologized to her rival reporters in a Slack message: \u201cMy editor says if the nytimes doesn\u2019t have to abide by the rules then we are out. I\u2019m really sorry. This sucks. And now it\u2019s a media story.\u201d A Times spokesperson, Danielle Rhoades Ha, said the publication is playing by the\u201cconsortium\u2019s ground rules,\u201d under which \u201cdocuments obtained by outlets prior to the consortium\u2019s creation are not subject to the embargo time.\u201d Haugen, for her part, has watched the Journal\u2019s rollout and its rivals\u2019 subsequent scramble to catch up with equanimity. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve met so many journalists, and I\u2019ve seen how hard Jeff works, I feel more grateful for the media than when I started,\u201d she said.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Flames and smoke from wildfires cover the landscape in British Columbia, Canada. Photographer: James ... [+] MacDonald/Bloomberg \u00a9 2021 Bloomberg Finance LP In the run up to COP 26, awareness of the climate crisis and the importance of an effective corporate response is at its height. Yet EcoAct has released its 6 th annual analysis of climate reporting showing that 81% of FTSE 100 companies don\u2019t yet have a robust climate plan. EcoAct released The Climate Reporting Performance of the FTSE 100, Euro STOXX 50 and DOW 30 . The report, which ranked the top 20 companies for climate disclosure, found that just 19% of the FTSE 100 have long-term emissions reduction targets to meet net-zero goals and only 3% have a long-term emissions reduction target aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. The challenge is the growing mainstream acceptance of the need for a net zero target, without either having put a plan to achieve the goal in place, or have the capacity to implement it. While its positive that the number of FTSE 100 companies committing to net zero is up from 45% to 66% in a year, a third have yet to make any such commitment. At the same time, perhaps of greatest concern given the need for at least 50% cuts in emissions by 2030 if we are to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, even amongst those who have made a net zero commitment, few have made any provision for carbon sequestration or removal. Carbon reduction is a must, offsetting only when necessary but its unlikely the world will reach net zero by 2050 without removal. And the issue of carbon offset in terms of type, permanence, double-counting, and so on, remains contentious. As Stuart Lemmon, managing director of EcoAct says, the issue is that while emissions reduction has moved from a \u2018good to have\u2019 to a necessity, companies are still scrambling to keep up with the requirements of a credible, achievable emissions target. He says, \u201cThe driver behind the report is to find and celebrate best practice, challenging companies to do more and better. There is increasingly a lot of good ambitious, long-term thinking in the corporate sector, and that should be highlighted.\u201d MORE FOR YOU Is Carbon Capture Another Fossil Fuel Industry Con? Sustainable Fashion Wants Brands To Redefine Business Growth Trouble With Predicting Future Of Transportation Is That Today Gets In The Way Lemmon says, \u201c\u201cOur analysis shows that when businesses have a clear framework to follow, the uptake on climate change action is vastly accelerated.\u201d A word of caution though, as he adds, \u201cThere is evidence that the corporate sector is stepping up but many haven\u2019t yet grasped the need for long term change. We need a transition pathway to get 80-90% reduction in emissions by 2050 and many don\u2019t have targets past 2030.\u201d In terms of different markets, the FTSE is doing better than the DOW 30 or Euro STOXX 50, where 63% and 64% have committed to net zero respectively. But less than a fifth of these listed businesses have long-term reduction targets to achieve this commitment, and only 2% have strategies in place that will achieve emissions reductions in line with 1.5\u00b0C. Nor is enough is being done to tackle value chain emissions \u2013 a critical issue where Scope 3 emissions can by up to 98% of a company\u2019s footprint. Across all indices, 65% of companies have set a Scope 1 & 2 SBT while only 39% of companies have set one for their Scope 3 emissions. Of the 178 companies scored this year, only AstraZeneca, Vodafone, Apple, and SAP SE have successfully set 1.5\u2070C aligned Scope 1, 2 and 3 SBTi validated SBTs. 65% of companies across all indices have now set an SBT, a 26% increase on 2020 (with the addition of Euro STOXX in 2021). Furthermore, many more of these SBTs are in line with a well below 2\u2070C or 1.5\u2070C scenario \u2013 from 20% last year to 51% this year. Globally, top performers across all indices (FTSE 100, DOW 30 and Euro STOXX 50) this year were Microsoft, Apple, Landsec, Vodafone and Schneider Electric. There are many listed companies with differing levels of significance in terms of footprint and climate impact. That makes it increasingly important to understand what each approach means, in terms of actions required, credibility and impact. Historically targets on emissions, when they existed at all, were often benchmarked against competitors, or identified based on what companies thought they could do rather than identifying an agreed goal for long term reduction with concrete actions outlined and implemented. In terms of the different approaches, the TCFD is an excellent first step in identifying the financial impact of climate risk. Developed by The Financial Stability Board (FSB), the TCFD recommendations provide a clear example of how governments globally can come together to create a framework that achieves a common climate goal. New Zealand has just implemented mandatory reporting for listed companies under TCFD, and the UK has announced it is to follow. SBTs, which Lemmon describes as a \u2018step-change\u2019, are about understanding the impact of business operations on the environment. It provides best practice for tackling emissions but only provides validation for 15 years. Sensible given how rapidly the technology, policy and investment frameworks are evolving, but still a relatively short-term goal in terms of society\u2019s needs. Both the TCFD and the SBTs do a good job of setting a clear standard that drives action. What net zero does however is reframe the goal completely. Lemmon says, \u201cNet zero stops being an incremental target and becomes an absolute end point. It requires every part of the business to transform, and long-term transitional thinking.\u201d Only such thinking drives deep corporate transformation, thinking about the costs over time, when it can be achieved and the most effective strategy for achieving it. There is no doubt that reporting on climate plans is complex and challenging. There are different standards that can be used - SBT itself is launching its Global Net Zero Standard next week. Awareness of the importance interaction between climate and nature, work on nature-based emissions solutions, natural capital accounting are only going to increase pressure on the corporate sector as investors struggle to understand the long term, as well as the short and medium term, issues. In the end though, it is only by putting claims under scrutiny that governance will improve. If we demand transparency and clarity, then we need globally agreed standards to make things easier. There is no question that we\u2019re taking steps in the right direction but with only eight years to halve global emissions, we need to move farther and faster now. Of course, the hopes of many lie in the hands of the negotiators at COP26. The hope that there will be a credible global net zero agreement, one that will see governments commit to emissions reduction pathways that inform the deployment of capital. That will drive financial commitments and corporate action. Without credible and robust commitments the impact that TCFD, SBT and net zero target requirements are having on the private sector may falter. And that's a chance the world can't afford.",

Shot with a 360-degree camera, the one-minute video takes you on a journey from the station\u2019s Node 3 module, also known as Tranquility, all the way to Europe\u2019s Columbus laboratory. A message accompanying the footage encourages you to \u201cimmerse yourself in this brief but unique fly-through [of] humankind\u2019s orbital outpost.\u201d As the 360-degree nature of the video lets you spin the image around to fully explore the module interiors, you can watch the footage multiple times and find something new each time. Gliding through the five different modules, you\u2019ll quickly realize the crazy amount of technology packed into the space station, which has been orbiting Earth at an altitude of 250 miles for the last two decades. The route taken by Pesquet in his fly-through-video, starting at Node 3. ESA Pesquet will soon be returning to Earth after his second six-month stint aboard the ISS in five years. During his most recent stay, the astronaut posted a series of videos aimed at helping interested folks learn more about some of the station\u2019s main modules. The videos, most of them also shot with a 360-degree camera, include an exploration of Destiny (described as the station\u2019s \u201cbeating heart\u201d) Columbus , Harmony (also known as Node 2), Tranquility (Node 3), and the station\u2019s latest arrival, Nauka . Pesquet has also been wowing earthlings with his photographic skills, posting incredible images of Earth from his unique vantage point high above our planet. The astronaut recently revealed how he plans his photo sessions to ensure he has the best chance of capturing great images.

    "full_description": "A video designed to help Parliament House staff better handle \u2018serious incidents\u2019 in the wake of the Brittany Higgins assault allegations has been viewed by less than half of the required employees. The head of the Department of Parliamentary Services Rob Stefanic told a Senate estimates hearing the DPS had overhauled its processes after Ms Higgins went public with her story in February. As part of that overhaul, a 13-minute training video was developed to help assist staff with responding to serious incidents. Asked by Labor senator Katy Gallagher, deputy secretary Cate Saunders could not say how many people had undertaken the training. \u201cTraining has very recently commenced. Once staff have completed the training, they will need to send an acknowledgment form to say that they've done it so that we have a record of that,\u201d Ms Saunders said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t know whether anyone\u2019s done it,\u201d Senator Gallagher replied. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Ms Saunders responded. \u201cHow are you going to check up on that? \u2026 Do you have a timetame that you want people trained by?\u201d Senator Gallagher quipped back. \u201cWithin a certain period of time \u2014 I\u2018m not sure, but certainly there\u2019s a tracking system that has been implemented. So, staff are required to complete a form to say that they\u2019ve done it, and the security branch will be closely monitoring that,\u201d Ms Saunders said. The estimates hearing was later told just 80 out of 180 staff had completed the training. Asked if they knew how long the video went for, Ms Saunders and Mr Stefanic revealed they had yet to complete the training. \u201cSo, you don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a 20-minute video or an hour video?\u201d Senator Gallagher said. \u201cI don\u2018t, but I will find that out for you,\u201d Ms Saunders responded. Senator Gallagher pressed on: \u201cBut you're in charge of it. It just seems odd that you wouldn\u2019t have watched the video yourself.\u201d Asked if anyone in the DPS executive had completed the training, the hearing was told the assistant secretary Leanne Tunningley had viewed and signed off on the video. In addition to the training, a new definition of serious incident was adopted by the department. It now considers an incident or pattern of behaviour that causes serious harm as a serious incident. \u201cIt provides our security staff guidance on how they should respond. Because it's been agreed with the AFP and the Department of Finance and with Prime Minister and Cabinet, there is an agreed process that we all will follow in the event a serious incident should occur,\u201d Mr Stefanic said. Half a dozen staff have now been interviewed by police as part of the investigation into Ms Higgins\u2018 allegation that she was raped in Parliament House. The matter is before the court. Meanwhile, the Australian Federal Police told estimates it had also overhauled its procedures for dealing with serious incidents on Capital Hill. AFP Deputy Commissioner Brett Pointing said a draft protocol was handed to parliament last week. Children as young as 13 have been caught plotting horrific attacks on Australian soil over the internet. A woman confronted with shocking footage of her own child sex abuse on website PornHub is leading a class-action lawsuit against its parent company. A government watchdog has confirmed it is investigating alcohol delivery service Jimmy Brings after a man\u2019s death in Sydney.",

    "full_description": "US electric car maker Tesla on Sunday rolled back the latest version of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software, less than a day after its release, after users complained of false collision warnings and other issues. The setback comes as Tesla is under regulatory scrutiny over the safety of its semi-autonomous driving technology, which it calls \" FSD .\" \"Seeing some issues with 10.3, so rolling back to 10.2 temporarily,\" Chief Executive Elon Musk said in a Twitter post on Sunday. Seeing some issues with 10.3, so rolling back to 10.2 temporarily. Please note, this is to be expected with beta software. It is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA, hence public beta. \"Please note, this is to be expected with beta software. It is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA (quality assurance), hence public beta,\" he said. Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside regular US business hours. The release of the new driving assist system to some owners of Tesla models, which the company said featured several improvements, had been announced for Friday, October 22. On Saturday, Musk said the release would probably be delayed by a day. \"Regression in some left turns at traffic lights found by internal QA in 10.3. Fix in work, probably releasing tomorrow,\" he tweeted on Saturday. The Tesla vehicles with the latest 10.3 software repeatedly provided Forward Collision Warnings when there was no immediate danger, according to video postings of beta users. Some vehicles also automatically applied brakes without reason, users said on social media posts. Some users said they lost the FSD beta software entirely after having problems with the latest iteration. There was no information on Sunday about a possible new date for the release, either from Musk on social media or from Tesla. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in August opened a formal safety probe into Tesla's Autopilot system in 765,000 US vehicles after a series of crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles. \u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2021 .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

Social media companies, which include anonymous forums like Reddit and smartphone dating apps like Bumble, would also be required to take all reasonsable steps to determine users' ages and prioritise children's interests when collecting data, the Online Privacy Bill said. The new proposed rules would put Australia among the most stringent countries in terms of age controls for social media, and build on efforts to rein in the power of Big Tech following mandatory licencing payments for media outlets and plans to toughen laws against online misinformation and defamation.

    "full_description": "Thanks to the close competition between the country\u2019s top three telecom operators, Vodafone Idea (Vi), Jio and Airtel, users are being offered lucrative plans and services when they subscribe to prepaid and postpaid plans. With gigabytes of data offered daily, many of these plans also offer access to specific OTT services, similar to how broadband services are now offering bundled subscriptions these days. When it comes to streaming videos and other content, one requires an adequate data plan if WiFi is not available. Both Vodafone and Jio offer plans that are priced around INR 500, offering users data and the ability to access their favourite streaming services. However, if users are to pick between these two packs, it is important to understand the benefits offered by both operators. Also read : Looking for a smartphone? Check Mobile Finder here . INR 500 Vodafone prepaid data plan Vodafone Idea has kept the competition with Jio going strong with its \u20b9 499 prepaid data plan that comes with 3GB of data, unlimited calls and 100 SMS every day. The INR 500 Vodafone prepaid data plan itself is valid for 28 days. As a result, users get 84GB of data, which Vi extends up to 100GB thanks to 16GB of bonus data. While this plan actually offers more data, the real benefit of subscribing to the data plan from Vi is the weekend data rollover and binge all night offers, which users can take advantage of to increase their data usage beyond the pack allowance. In terms of OTT services, Vi subscribers get access to Disney+Hotstar\u2019s recently introduced Mobile-only plan which otherwise costs \u20b9 499 per year. INR 499 Jio prepaid data plan The Jio prepaid data plan that competes with the Vi offer is a data pack that costs INR 499 and is also valid for a period of 28 days. Users are offered 3GB of data every day, just like the other plan with unlimited calls and 100 SMS every day. With 3GB data every day, users can access up to 84GB in a month, and Jio offers an additional 6GB, which brings the total up to 90GB. This is still 10GB less than Vi offers in its INR 501 data pack. In terms of OTT services, users will gain access to the same Disney+Hotstar streaming plan for mobiles, while also gaining access to JioTV and JioCinema. The pricing of the plan was adjusted to accommodate the new streaming plans of Disney+Hotstar. However, the Jio INR 499 plan does not have the same data benefits (weekend rollover, plus binge all night) that the Vi plan does which puts it at a disadvantage compared to its competitor. It also offers less data (10GB less than Vi) which is worth keeping in mind when signing up for this plan.",

Social media companies, which include anonymous forums like Reddit and smartphone dating apps like Bumble, would also be required to take all reasonable steps to determine users' ages and prioritise children's interests when collecting data, the Online Privacy Bill said. Also read : Looking for a smartphone? Check Mobile Finder here . The new proposed rules would put Australia among the most stringent countries in terms of age controls for social media, and build on efforts to rein in the power of Big Tech following mandatory licencing payments for media outlets and plans to toughen laws against online misinformation and defamation. Facebook this month faced anger from US lawmakers after a former company employee and whistleblower handed thousands of documents to congressional investigators amid concerns the company harmed children's mental health and has stoked societal divisions - a development cited by Australian lawmakers on Monday. \"We are ensuring (Australians') data and privacy will be protected and handled with care,\" said Attorney-General Michaelia Cash in a statement. \"Our draft legislation means that these companies will be punished heavily if they don't meet that standard,\" she added. Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention David Coleman said the \"leak of Facebook's own internal research demonstrates the impact social media platforms can have on body image and the mental health of young people\". Facebook's director of public policy in Australia and New Zealand, Mia Garlick, said in a statement that the company was reviewing the proposed law and understood \"the importance of ensuring Australia's privacy laws evolve at a comparable pace to the rate of innovation and new technology we're experiencing today\". Under the draft law, privacy watchdog The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner would receive the full investigation and enforcement powers, with the ability to fine a corporation up to A$10 million, 10% of its annual turnover or three times the financial benefit of any breach.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin During 2020 and 2021, cloud computing exploded as work went virtual and businesses adapted to the global pandemic by focusing on the delivery of digital services. In 2022, we will undoubtedly see a continuation of rapid adoption and growth. The 5 Biggest Cloud Computing Trends In 2022 Adobe Stock It\u2019s likely that we will see the focus shift away from the deployment of cloud tools and platforms in order to improve a specific function (such as shifting to Zoom meetings) towards more holistic strategies centered on enterprise-wide cloud migration. Augmenting the abilities of remote and hybridized workforces will remain a key trend, but we will see ongoing innovation in cloud and data center infrastructure too. Here\u2019s my overview of some of the key ways this will materialize in 2022. Cloud continues to grow and evolve with exciting new use cases According to predictions from Gartner, global spending on cloud services is expected to reach over $482 billion in 2022, up from $313 billion in 2020. Cloud computing infrastructure is the backbone of the delivery pipeline of just about every digital service, from social media and streaming entertainment to connected cars and autonomous internet of things (IoT) infrastructure. New or upcoming ultra-fast networks like 5G and Wi-Fi 6E don't just mean more data will be streamed from the cloud; they mean new types of data can be streamed. We see this with the explosion in the availability of cloud gaming platforms such as Google's Stadia and Amazon Luna, which will see increasing levels of investment over the course of 2022. We will also see the arrival of cloud virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) which should lead to smaller and cheaper headsets. Cloud technology essentially makes every other technology lighter, faster, and more accessible from a customer point of view, and this fact will be a key driver in the migration of more services to cloud platforms. Sustainability is increasingly a driver of cloud innovation Every responsible business understands that it has a part to play in tackling the challenges of climate change. In tech, this often centers on reducing the energy usage associated with increasingly powerful computing engines, larger digital storage requirements, and the energy costs of providing 24/7 \u201calways-on\u201d infrastructure services to customers. Most of the tech giants will spend 2022 implementing measures and innovations aimed at helping them achieve their net-zero carbon aspirations. Amazon, the world's biggest cloud company, is also the world's biggest buyer of renewable energy and also has 206 of its own sustainable energy projects running worldwide, generating around 8.5GW per year. Now it is also focusing on reducing the \u201cdownstream\u201d energy usage created by its products like Echo and Fire TV once they are in customers\u2019 homes. Of course, it's great that sustainability is high on the agenda these days, but for businesses like Amazon, the reasons go beyond the purely altruistic \u2013 it\u2019s forecast that the effects of climate change with cost companies up to $1.6 trillion per year by 2025. MORE FOR YOU The 5 Biggest Technology Trends In 2022 \u2018Enthusiastic Entrepreneurs\u2019: Pre-IPO Statements On Profitability Prove To Be Larger Than Real Life The 7 Biggest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Trends In 2022 Hybrid cloud blurs the distinction between public and private clouds Since businesses started migrating to the cloud, they have traditionally had two options. They can use easily accessible, pay-as-you-go public cloud solutions or more customized and flexible private cloud solutions. Private cloud (where an organization effectively has its own cloud, and data never has to leave its premises) is also sometimes needed for regulatory and security reasons. Today, companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM (the biggest cloud providers) are expanding their rollout of \"hybrid\" models that adopt a best-of-both-worlds approach. Data that needs to be quickly and frequently accessed, perhaps by customers, can be kept on public AWS or Azure servers and accessed through tools, applications, and dashboards. More sensitive or mission-critical data can be kept on private servers where access can be monitored, and it can be processed using proprietary applications. Another driving force behind the growth in popularity of hybrid cloud is that many companies are growing past their first forays into cloud computing, and having established the benefits, are looking for additional use cases. This has resulted in many companies finding themselves in a \u201cmulti-cloud\u201d environment, using a number of services sometimes from several different suppliers. A hybrid cloud approach can reduce the complexity of this thanks to the emphasis put on streamlining the user experience and keeping the backend stack invisible when it doesn\u2019t need to be seen. AI in cloud computing Cloud computing plays a key role in the deliverance of artificial intelligence (AI) services \u2013 described by Google CEO Sundar Pichai as \u201cmore profound than electricity or fire\u201d in terms of the effect it will have on society. Machine learning platforms require huge processing power and data bandwidth for training and processing data, and cloud datacentres make this available to anyone. Most of the \u201ceveryday\u201d AI we see all around us \u2013 from Google Search to Instagram filters \u2013 lives in the cloud, and technology that routes traffic from data centers to our devices and manages storage infrastructure is built on machine learning. The development and evolution of cloud and AI are inextricably interwoven, and this will only become more true during 2022 and beyond. Strong trends in AI will be \u201ccreative\u201d algorithms \u2013 generative machine learning that can create anything from art to synthetic data to train more AIs \u2013 as well as language modeling \u2013 increasing the accuracy with machines can understand human languages. Cloud computing will certainly play a key role in delivering these services to users as well as building the infrastructure to deliver them. The Rise of serverless Serverless cloud is a relatively new concept that\u2019s gaining traction in the market from providers including Amazon (AWS Lambda), Microsoft (Azure Functions), and IBM Cloud Functions. Sometimes referred to as \"functions-as-a-service,\" it means organizations aren't tied into leasing servers or paying for fixed amounts of storage or bandwidth. It promises a truly pay-as-you-go service where the infrastructure scales invisibly as an application requires it. Of course, it isn\u2019t really serverless \u2013 the servers are still there \u2013 but it adds another layer of abstraction between the user and the platform, meaning the user doesn\u2019t have to get involved with configurations and technicalities. Serverless within cloud computing will have a big part to play in the broader trend across cloud and the entire tech landscape of creating new user experiences that make innovation more accessible.

    "full_description": "Australia looks set to adopt a net zero by 2050 target and while it might have taken a while for the country to get to this point \u2014 change will likely happen quickly. The emissions reduction target is still 30 years away but experts believe many of the changes required will need to happen in the next 10 years for the world to have a good chance of meeting this goal. Climate Councillor economist Nicki Hutley believes Australians will notice things changing pretty quickly. \u201cI think change will come much more quickly than people understand now,\u201d Ms Hutley told news.com.au. This is partly because state and territory governments as well as businesses were already acting. \u201cWe are already on this path but I think it will happen more quickly, partly because of international pressure for it to happen, but also because people are there and the policies are on the way \u2014 we just need to move more quickly,\u201d she said. Ms Hutley believes the coronavirus pandemic has also helped people. \u201cThey understand that radical changes can happen quickly and we are far more adaptable than we give ourselves credit for.\u201d So what does net zero mean for Australians and how much will it change people\u2019s lives? This is what we know. Our holidays may change The global aviation industry produces around 2 per cent of all carbon emissions so the race is on to find a way to make this more efficient. There is already research into biofuels or hydrogen-fuelled aircraft. Other options could include giving people an emissions budget for travel every year so the burden is shared equally, Ms Hutley said. In order to reduce emissions, people may chose to holiday closer to home and electric powered campervans may become a familiar sight on our roads. WFH could stay and bike lanes will improve Cities are already improving active transport infrastructure like bike lanes to make it easier for people to travel short distances without generating emissions. Ms Hutley believes governments will also improve public transport and coronavirus has already changed the thinking around working from home. \u201cI think cities will look different, there will be more working from home but also more regional hubs,\u201d she said. We\u2019ll need to switch from gas to electricity Gas cooktops were once a sought-after feature but they could soon be a thing of the past with induction alternatives seen as a great environmentally friendly alternative. While gas generates less emissions than coal, it still releases carbon and is not compatible with a net zero emissions home. This will see gas heaters also replaced by reverse cycle air-conditioning and solar hot water systems. Hydrogen could also be used by households in the future although it\u2019s not clear whether this will be feasible. However the University of NSW, Sydney, is developing the LAVO hydrogen hybrid battery as an alternative to Tesla\u2019s lithium version. How we eat could change While giving up meat entirely may not be necessary, Ms Hutley believes the mix of what we eat could change. Methane from cows contributes to carbon emissions and research is underway into how they can be fed more efficiently. \u201cThere\u2019s research into seaweed and how it can reduce emissions in a cow\u2019s diet,\u201d she said. However, scientists are also developing lab grown meat and Ms Hutley said it may also be necessary to look at how we feed the population more efficiently as farming in general involves land clearing. A household choosing to eat chicken instead of beef could save 1.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from being released every year. Becoming vegetarian could save 2.5 tonnes. We\u2019ll need to be more energy efficient Climateworks has estimated about a third of the world\u2019s emissions reduction over the next decade or so would need to come from better energy use. Households could be encouraged to buy more efficient whitegoods including fridge, washing machine and dryers. Climateworks believes the energy efficiency of existing buildings can be improved by 41 to 44 per cent, and new buildings could be improved by 51 to 56 per cent through things like insulation and double glazing. An International Energy Agency report this year suggested that by 2025 \u2014 just four years away \u2014 80 per cent of all appliances sold in advance economies should be the most efficient models available, and no gas boilers should be sold, to achieve net zero by 2050. We\u2019ll need more renewable electricity Electricity contributes the most to Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, with 33 per cent coming from this sector. Getting this down will be a priority and this will likely mean more solar, wind and importantly \u2014 more batteries, hydro and other firming technologies. Ms Hutley said the push for net zero emissions would likely see more battery storage in households and at a commercial scale. EVs will finally be trendy When Labor first raised the idea of a quick transition to electric cars as one of its election promises in 2019, many people freaked out but a few years later and the idea seems to be catching on. It\u2019s probably been helped by sexy new technology including an electric road bike that could be available this year for those adrenaline junkies and there\u2019s even a hydrogen-powered vehicle . Switching to EVs is seen as one of the easiest and cheapest ways of getting emissions down, some are calling for all new cars sold in Australia to be electric in about 15 years. The Grattan Institute modelling released today found switching to EVs, could be enough to meet 40 per cent of the emissions reductions Australia needs to achieve between now and 2030. There are already a huge variety of green cars being manufactured overseas that are not for sale here but this could change if we introduce new emissions standards. The NSW and Victorian governments are already offering $3000 subsidies for some EVs and Ms Hutley believes this is an area that could see the fastest change. \u201cWe are seeing all state governments step up to invest in charging infrastructure,\u201d she said. The ACT is also investing in electric fire trucks and ambulances, while NSW is investing in electric buses. New industries will emerge Phasing out coal-fired power is crucial to reducing emissions, especially in the electricity sector. A report from the International Energy Agency suggested the least-efficient coal-fired power plants should be phased out by 2030 and all coal by 2040. However, new industries will emerge and with those industries will come new opportunities. Ms Huntley said what happens with the hydrogen sector will be very important, and it may provide some of the jobs of the future. Some have predicted it could become a trillion-dollar industry . Other products such as \u201cgreen aluminium\u201d could also provide opportunities for Australian businesses. \u201cAustralia has the opportunity to grow lots of new sectors if we get in there early,\u201d Ms Huntley said. She said Australia could become a powerhouse in the Asia Pacific region for energy-intensive products produced without the use of fossil fuels, like fertiliser and cement. \u201cThe demand is there from other countries,\u201d she said. Ms Huntley believes new experiences and jobs that we haven\u2019t enough thought about may well emerge in the next few years, just like they have in more recent years. \u201cI think Generation Z is already thinking about how to live a more sustainable life \u2014 being less materialistic and to make it more about experiences,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be more conscious and conscientious in our choices.\u201d To join the conversation, please log in.

While the show is now a hot topic in social media its influence can be seen across the include be it in Halloween costumes, shoes, or smartphone apps. Tens and thousands of users were tempted to download one such app that has only masqueraded as malware giving cybercriminals an open door to steal the users\u2019 precious data. Squid Game malware that could have put your data at risk The malicious app disguised as the Squid Game wallpaper app was recently flagged by a security firm on the Play Store. First spotted by ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko, who studies malware at the security firm, the malicious app was said to have been downloaded at least 5,000 times before Google took it down from the app store. Named as \u2018Squid Game Wallpaper 4K HD,\u2019 the app was found of being used to spread the notorious Joker malware. In this case, anyone downloading the wallpaper could have fallen under the trap of costly SMS services. The app could download and execute native libraries and APK payloads as well, the security researcher noted in his post. Joker malware has been around for years now, if the app followed similar tricks, chances are that miscreants could have signed up affected users for some premium services. Stefano notes that besides this app there are more than 200 apps based on Squid Game available on Google Play. Amongst the unofficial apps, the \u201cSquid Games\u2014The Game\u201d replicated the famous Red Light, Green Light game, a similar one that could also be seen on Instagram. The game reached a million installs in just ten days. \u201cSeems like a great opportunity to make money on in-app ads from one of the most popular TV shows without the official game,\u201d he said. Although it wasn\u2019t malicious, a handful of unofficial apps that Stefano checked weren\u2019t harmful as well. However, the researcher notes that threat lurks around given the popularity of the new series and users should take a cautious approach if downloading Squid Game apps. Google has now removed the app from the Play Store, but Android users who have downloaded the app are advised to immediately remove it from their device. Further, users are advised to download apps from authorised sources and read the reviews, check if the app looks authentic before pressing the download button.

Named as \u2018Squid Game Wallpaper 4K HD,\u2019 the app was found of being used to spread the notorious Joker malware. In this case, anyone downloading the wallpaper could have fallen under the trap of costly SMS services. The app could download and execute native libraries and APK payloads as well, the security researcher noted in his post.

Stefano notes that besides this app there are more than 200 apps based on Squid Game available on Google Play. Amongst the unofficial apps, the \u201cSquid Games\u2014The Game\u201d replicated the famous Red Light, Green Light game , a similar one that could also be seen on Instagram. The game reached a million installs in just ten days. \u201cSeems like a great opportunity to make money on in-app ads from one of the most popular TV shows without the official game,\u201d he said. Although it wasn\u2019t malicious, a handful of unofficial apps that Stefano checked weren\u2019t harmful as well. However, the researcher notes that threat lurks around given the popularity of the new series and users should take a cautious approach if downloading Squid Game apps. Google has now removed the app from the Play Store, but Android users who have downloaded the app are advised to immediately remove it from their device. Further, users are advised to download apps from authorised sources and read the reviews, check if the app looks authentic before pressing the download button.

    "description": "Just how fickle football can be is underlined by this new feel-good factor surrounding the Irish men\u2019s team. From widespread handwringing not so long ago, a couple of victories have rejuvenated belief in both the side and its manager, Stephen Kenny. Ireland, it seems, is back in the results business. That the substance of those two results is debatable doesn\u2019t seem to matter. An away win in Azerbaijan, the 119th ranked team in the world, as well as a 4-0 friendly thrashing of Qatar in Dublin hardly represent earth-shattering form - although it has at least boosted Kenny\u2019s previous dismal statistical record of a single win against the microstate of Andorra in 16 matches. Almost as important as the two results, though, has been the method behind them. It has helped set a new mood-music. Modern Irish football history has been dominated by the perennial style versus substance debate. Here at least has been some evidence that the two are not incompatible. Whether it is simply relief at the novelty of winning again, or reassurance at the sight of Irish players stringing passes together to people they know, the Irish football public does appear to have pounced on the positive spirit with a fervour that reflects how downcast expectations had become. Such a reaction inevitably provokes corresponding dangers of inflating presumptions to an unreasonable degree. On the back of a couple of games some players who had been previously maligned are now getting reviews that flirt with being rave. Managing to dominate the Qatari midfield has morphed Jeff Hendrick from relative anonymity to potential dynamo of Newcastle\u2019s new order: Callum Robinson isn\u2019t some pampered second-rater but a free-spirited goal machine waiting to escape from championship level at West Brom. If the mundane reality in both cases is more middle-of-the-road, only the truly negative will insist on cocking a snoot at a rare injection of optimism into the atmosphere surrounding the national team\u2019s fortunes. It already appears to have ensured Kenny\u2019s future in the job. Having come through a bruising crash-course in how volatile the public tenor can be, those last two victories appear to have made a new contract something that\u2019s Kenny\u2019s to lose in Ireland\u2019s final couple of World Cup qualifying group games. Overpowering the Azeris and Qataris might have been technically meaningless but their political value is stamped all over Kenny\u2019s boosted status and Irish football\u2019s new frame of mind. Should it sustain through next month\u2019s matches against Portugal and Luxembourg then Kenny\u2019s signature is assured as he targets qualification for Euro 2024. It could also provoke the commercial world into measuring that intangible element called popular sentiment. Such have been the doldrums that the senior men\u2019s team has sunk to that it doesn\u2019t have a sponsor. It has been almost two years since the \u2018Three\u2019 deal finished up. Since then the FAI has put a lot of work into replacing them but without success. That\u2019s a stark bottom-line verdict from the business world. Advertising works on association. And the commercial market has bluntly decided it doesn\u2019t want to be associated with this Ireland team. It\u2019s not like such reluctance is hard to fathom. Years of nightmare headlines about the administration and governance of soccer in this country have taken a reputational toll. No one wants their product to conjure associations with ineptitude off the pitch and mediocrity on it. Some reports suggest that some FAI conceit at least hasn\u2019t disappeared with an apparent value still being put on their headline sponsorship at E2.5 million per year. Several potential sponsors have baulked at that and again it\u2019s not hard to see why. Names with proven star appeal on the pitch such as a Duff or any kind of Keane aren\u2019t around anymore. They\u2019re not off the pitch either. Kenny\u2019s leadership skills don\u2019t lend themselves to much obvious charisma. It\u2019s also been a long time since being able to presume on qualification for major tournaments. But what these two latest wins have produced is some vital momentum. They have germinated a little hope in Irish football. Should that flower a little more against Portugal and Luxembourg then there is every chance of capturing the popular imagination in a big way. There is little the Irish football public appreciates more than a battling underdog. But this is a setup that at least aspires to be a little different in how it plays, with a manager who, whatever else might be said about him, has the courage of his convictions even when he\u2019s the one being put under pressure. That has produced moments that have left some hard-nosed pundits wincing. But there seems to be some wider appreciation of the ambition towards a more expansive way of playing by a side where the emphasis is very much on youth. Perhaps it is that changing face that is at the heart of this new optimism. This is a representative side that is recognizably reflective of Ireland today. And it is a side that is easy to like. Both on and off the pitch there appears to be an easy confidence about the younger squad members in particular that is easy to warm to. These are players who are relatable to the next generation of soccer fans, including those from diverse heritages and backgrounds. It\u2019s probably little wonder then that after back to back wins, and with Covid-19 restrictions lifting to allow a full house in Lansdowne for Ronaldo & Co, that the popular mood is a lot more upbeat than it was. Of course the fates may swing back again too. When the outcome of a game against Luxembourg is the measure of progress, then it is dangerous to be presumptive. But, if they don\u2019t, proof that the team and the public are in sync again might come from big business paying up to be associated with the boys in green.",

    "full_description": "SUVs are at the top of most new car shopping lists, but it\u2019s the coupe-styled versions that are proving to be the must have item of 2021 and their popularity has surprised some car companies. Here are five things you need to know about the Porsche Cayenne Coupe. IT\u2019S A CAYENNE LARGE SUV, BUT PRETTIER Well, to some eyes. More and more prestige brands are taking their giant and imposing SUVs and softening them with coupe-like sloping rear ends. A sportier and prettier tail results, and Porsche has done an excellent job with the Coupe\u2019s behind, with shades of 911 to the rear light strip. Its front end looks a dash gawky, though. Competitors include the BMW X6, Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe and Audi Q8. Porsche Australia originally thought about one-in-five Cayenne shoppers would pick the coupe over the normal wagon version, but this year coupe sales make up more than half the Cayennes sold. We\u2019re slaves to fashion. EVEN THE BASIC ONE GOES LIKE STINK Porsche doesn\u2019t know how to make slow cars. This entry-level $139,000 version ($11,000 more than the normal Cayenne) has a turbocharged V6 petrol engine good for 250kW and 450Nm. Despite weighing more than two tonnes, it\u2019ll still haul to 100km/h in six seconds flat. A V8 GTS version does the job in 4.5 seconds, the Turbo in 3.9 seconds and $336,100 Turbo GT in a frankly ridiculous 3.3 seconds. Cornering skills feel equally physics defying. Adaptive suspension is standard and you can choose drive modes via a rotary dial on the steering-wheel. It can never truly hide its size and weight, but the Cayenne has great control and poise. There are 20-inch wheels as standard, but our 21-inch RS Spyder rims (a $5130 option) with skinny rubber meant some harsh hits over bad surfaces. IT\u2019LL TOW YOUR BOAT TOO SUV shoppers want versatility. The Cayenne Coupe ticks the performance and handling boxes, seats four (five seats is a no-cost option), has impressive rear room despite the coupe styling and can tow as much as a Toyota LandCruiser. The Cayenne Coupe can handle 3500kg of braked trailer behind, meaning your lifestyle toys \u2013 yacht, horse float or caravan \u2013 can be brought along for the ride. The V6 officially gulps a claimed 9.5L/100km, though we used 12L/100km. With your boat and trailer rigged it\u2019s going to be expensive to run. THE INTERIOR IS PLUSH Partial leather electric seats come in \u201ccomfort\u201d guise or \u201csport\u201d (with integrated headrests) while a panoramic glass roof lifts the otherwise very black interior. There\u2019s a 12-inch touchscreen, satnav, a 7-inch digital navigation map in the instrument cluster, wireless Apple CarPlay, 10-speaker audio, dual-zone aircon and a power tailgate. A classic Porsche tachometer survives despite all the digitisation. Safety gear includes auto emergency braking, a blind-spot monitor, radar cruise and a 360-degree camera. Porsche has lowered the rear seats by 30mm to offer decent headroom, and as the roof line is only 20mm lower than a normal Cayenne, even tall adults have ample leg and head room. OPTIONS CAN BLOW OUT THE COSTS For a car costing about $150,000 drive-away, there are some annoying omissions to the standard equipment list. Porsche insists buyers pay for tech that is standard on many $40,000 cars. Lowlights include lane-keep assist ($1220), ambient lighting ($850), heated front seats ($910) and ventilated seats ($2120). Other expensive options include contrast decorative stitching for $7250, a lightweight package (carbon roof, lighter wheels, etc.) for $26,860 and carbon exterior mirrors at $3120. A sports exhaust \u2013 it sounds a bit tame otherwise \u2013 is $5970. This new premium challenger has landed on Australian roads and is bringing lots of luxury at a serious discount to its German rivals. Many luxury car makers have expanded their ranges to make it more affordable to get into a vehicle with a prestige badge, including this SUV. This SUV makes up one third of all this Japanese brand\u2019s sales in Australia and a mass of major upgrades has only made it better.",

    "description": "Extending people\u2019s mortgage payments into their 80s and 90s might help 95,000 people who still owe a lump sum at the end of their mortgage term, the State\u2019s insolvency agency has said. There are almost 30,000 people in long-term mortgage arrears who have missed mortgage repayments for more than a year, but there are a further 95,000 people \u2013 representing about 13 per cent of all home mortgages and \u20ac14.5 billion of debt \u2013 that are facing a shortfall in repaying the balance at the end of the mortgage term. This group includes many people who borrowed heavily during the economic boom and may subsequently have restructured unaffordable mortgages but are now in their late 50s, 60s and 70s and approaching retirement with no means of repaying the outstanding sums of money. Michael McNaughton, the director of the Insolvency Service of Ireland \u2013 the State body that helps return insolvent people to solvency \u2013 said recent court cases extending monthly mortgage repayments and reducing them for people in or approaching retirement into their 80s or 90s might be a way of solving this large amount of unsustainable mortgage debt. Last week the Circuit Court overruled an objection from a bank permitting an indebted 68-year-old Waterford handyman to stay in his home for life on reduced repayments of \u20ac93 a month with the outstanding \u20ac97,000 mortgage to be repaid from the sale of his home after his death. \u2018Complementary solution\u2019 Mr McNaughton said the State\u2019s mortgage-to-rent scheme \u2013 where a borrower switches from owning their home to renting it as a social housing tenant \u2013 was one solution that could help but was \u201cquite restrictive\u201d. Therefore, extending mortgage repayments in someone\u2019s 80s or 90s was \u201ca complementary solution\u201d to the State-backed scheme and a \u201cviable alternative\u201d to repossession. \u201cThese kinds of solutions are aimed first of all at 25,000 people who are in arrears and in arrears of more than two years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think also it could be a way forward for older borrowers who might not technically be in arrears but they have no way of paying off the mortgage within their working lives.\u201d Some borrowers are facing shortfalls from interest-only arrangements. Where loans were restructured because they could not afford their repayments, some face the full repayment of a lump sum that was \u201cwarehoused\u201d in the years after the property crash to be paid at a later date. \u201cThere are a lot of mortgages that have been restructured but they are not necessarily sustainable,\u201d said Mr McNaughton. The Central Bank has urged lenders and borrowers to engage with each other on making plans to deal with lump-sum payment due at the end of the mortgage terms and to start clearing down the \u201cwarehoused\u201d part of the debt if the borrower can before the end of the term. Mr McNaughton said investment funds that bought distressed mortgages from the banks had been engaging more with borrowers than some banks and agreeing to \u201cinnovative solutions\u201d. Long-term repayment arrangements can create income for the funds from these distressed loans and allow them to sell tranches of similar loans on in securitisation deals, he said. Non-bank entities such as Start Mortgage and Pepper Ireland held 54 per cent of all home mortgages in arrears of more than one year at the end of March.",

    "full_description": "Facebook was well aware that hate speech was spreading on its site in India which could exacerbate ethnic violence, and did not deploy resources to curb the phenomenon, US media reported, citing internal documents. The so-called Facebook Papers, leaked by whistleblower Frances Haugen , have already revealed the impact of Facebook \u2014 as well as of WhatsApp and Instagram , both of which it owns \u2014 on the deep polarisation of politics in the United States and on the mental health of some teenagers. But there have long been concerns over the social network's impact in spreading hate speech fuelling violence in the developing world, such as the massacre targeting the Rohingya minority in Myanmar. This weekend the Wall Street Journal , the New York Times , and the Washington Post , among others, focused on Facebook's presence in India, the biggest market for the US-based company and its messaging service WhatsApp in terms of users. A report by the company's own researchers from July 2020 showed that the share of inflammatory content skyrocketed starting in December 2019. \"Rumours and calls to violence spread particularly on Facebook's WhatsApp messaging service in late February 2020,\" when clashes between the Hindu majority and Muslim minority left dozens dead, the Wall Street Journal reported. Facebook had also as early as February 2019 created a fictitious account, that of a 21-year-old woman in northern India, to better understand the user experience, the Washington Post reported, citing an internal memo. The account followed posts, videos, and accounts recommended by Facebook, but a company researcher found it promoted a torrent of fake and inflammatory content. \"I've seen more images of dead people in the past three weeks than I've seen in my entire life,\" media quoted the staffer as saying in a 46-page report among the documents released by Haugen. \"Soon, without any direction from the user, the Facebook account was flooded with pro- Modi propaganda and anti-Muslim hate speech,\" the Washington Post reported . Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist, was campaigning for re-election at the time. The test also coincided with India launching an air strike on Pakistan over a militant suicide bombing in the disputed Kashmir region. The unnamed researcher called that experience an \"integrity nightmare.\" The content made jingoistic claims about India's air strikes and included graphic pictures. These included one image of a man holding a severed head and using language slamming Pakistanis and Muslims as \"dogs\" and \"pigs,\" reports said. Bad actors, authoritarian regimes \"Facebook has meticulously studied its approach abroad \u2014 and was well aware that weaker moderation in non-English-speaking countries leaves the platform vulnerable to abuse by bad actors and authoritarian regimes,\" the Post continued, citing the internal documents. The documents showed that the vast majority of the company's budget dedicated to the fight against misinformation is intended for the United States \u2014 even though users there represent less than 10 percent of Facebook's users worldwide. \"We've invested significantly in technology to find hate speech in various languages, including Hindi and Bengali,\" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. \"As a result, we've reduced the amount of hate speech that people see by half this year. Today, it's down to 0.05 percent.\" The figure is a percentage of content in all countries. The company said it was \"expanding\" its operations into new languages. It has \"hate speech classifiers\" working in Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, and Urdu. More than 40 civil rights groups warned last year that Facebook had failed to address dangerous content in India. One Facebook India executive resigned in 2020 after being accused of refusing to apply hate speech policies to the Hindu nationalist ruling party and also sharing an anti-Muslim post. \"Hate speech against marginalised groups, including Muslims, is on the rise globally. So we are improving enforcement,\" the spokesperson said. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",

    "full_description": "The Australian regulator behind a law forcing large internet platforms to negotiate licencing deals with media outlets said on Monday he was \u201cconcerned\u201d about Facebook Inc\u2019s cooperation, seven months after the rule took effect. Under the News Media Bargaining Code, the social media giant and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google must negotiate with news outlets for content that drives traffic to their websites or face possible government intervention. \u201cGoogle is still negotiating and finalising deals with more news media companies and seems to be approaching this exercise in the right spirit,\u201d Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chair Rod Sims said in a statement. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png \u201cWe are concerned that Facebook does not currently seem to take the same approach.\u201d Since the controversial law was passed in March, Facebook and Google have struck licencing deals with most of Australia\u2019s largest news outlets, including Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp and the Australian Broadcasting Corp. But some smaller publishers say Facebook, in contrast to Google, has declined to negotiate with them. Academic publisher The Conversation and foreign language broadcaster SBS were both denied discussions. As reported first by Reuters, Facebook said in an email to publishers in September it had concluded deals to pay Australian companies for content on its \u201cFacebook News\u201d channel. Facebook was not immediately available for comment on Monday. The company told Reuters in September that content deals were \u201cjust one of the ways Facebook provides support to publishers\u201d and it continued to have discussions about alternatives. The media law allows for the government to intervene if a platform fails to negotiate with a media company, a condition that has not yet been invoked. Sims said a planned federal government review of the law next year would \u201cexamine closely the performance of all parties and whether the government\u2019s expectations have been met\u201d.",

    "full_description": "Samsung is expected to soon announce what could be the biggest upgrade to its Exynos chips in years. The partnership it started with AMD a few years back is anticipated to level up the silicon\u2019s graphics game, utilizing AMD\u2019s rDNA technology for the benefit of mobile users. There has been some uncertainty, however, about which devices will be betting this Exynos 2200, especially with the ongoing chip shortage. The latest word gives a small amount of relief to would-be Galaxy S22 buyers, but the actual availability of this chip might still be in question. Given recent controversies surrounding Samsung\u2019s Exynos silicon, the arrival of the AMD-powered Exynos 2200 is naturally hoped to bring some much-needed salvation for the business. Early benchmarks look promising, at least under certain contexts and conditions, and the entry of graphics technology from AMD could spark a new area for competition among mobile chipset makers. Whether the Exynos 2200 lives up to expectation is, of course, a completely different question, but many are waiting with bated breath for what\u2019s coming. Unfortunately, present economic conditions might put a damper on that enthusiasm. Initially, there were doubts that Samsung would even put the Exynos 2200 inside its next smartphone flagship, reserving it for tablets or an ARM-powered Windows laptop. Eventually, rumors evolved to expect limited availability of Exynos-powered Galaxy S22 phones, probably exclusive to the Galaxy S22 Ultra. Android Police\u2019s Max Weinbach, however, gives a bit more hope by \u201cconfirming\u201d that it will be available for all variants of the phone. The Galaxy S22, Galaxy S22+ (or Pro), and Galaxy S22 Ultra will get both Exynos 2200 and Snapdragon 898 versions, which, of course, still depend on the market. oh yeah s22, s22+, s22 ultra is gonna have an exynos 2200 and a snapdragon 898 version found it a few weeks ago \u2014 Max Weinbach (@MaxWinebach) October 22, 2021 Unfortunately, that latter might mean that those in the US won\u2019t be seeing the graphics upgrade that the Exynos 2200 will promise. Buyers in the US have only been able to get Snapdragon-powered devices from Samsung, while European markets once had to contend with weaker Exynos chips only. It seems that tables will be turned and those in the US will feel short-changed when the Galaxy S22 arrives.",

    "full_description": "Apple recently held its second fall event of the year, where it announced new M1 Pro and M1 Max processors, all-new MacBook Pros and AirPods 3. Surprisingly, the tech giant also announced a lower-cost version of Apple Music called \u201cVoice Plan during the high-profile event. Although it costs half the price of an individual Apple Music subscription, it still provides access to the music service\u2019s entire catalogue of 90 million songs. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the Apple Music Voice Plan. What is Apple Music Voice Plan? Well, the new Apple Music Voice Plan is a part of a new subscription tier in Apple Music. Under the plan, users will get access to the entire Apple Music catalog of 90 million tracks. The plan actually makes a lot of sense if you use Siri, Apple\u2019s voice-based assistant, to play music on your HomePod, AirPods, or iPads. Subscribers can ask Siri to pull up playlists, songs and radio stations. If you want Spatial audio, you need to subscribe to the individual plan. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png What\u2019s the caveat? While the Apple Music Voice Plan at Rs 49/month may seem tempting, but the only limitation is that users only use it with Siri and your voice. When you subscribe to the new Apple Music Voice Plan, there will be a dedicated section called \u201cJust Ask Siri\u201d within the app where subscribers learn how to interact with Apple Music through your voice commands. In fact, the Apple Music app has a slightly tweaked user interface just for \u2018Voice Plan\u2019 subscribers. So, for example, if you want to listen to Adele\u2019s new single \u201cEasy on Me\u201d, rather than typing the name of the artist/song, you need to ask Siri to play the track. The idea is clearly to increase the usage of Siri. How much do I have to pay for the \u201cVoice Plan\u201d? In India, Apple Music Voice Plan costs Rs 49 per month. Apple Music typically costs Rs 99 per month for individuals or Rs 149 per month for families. A discounted plan for students is available at Rs 49 per month. Also read | iPhone 14 to AirPods Pro 2: 8 Apple products we\u2019re most excited about in 2022 Where is the plan available? The Apple Music Voice Plan will be available later this fall in 17 countries, including India, Australia, Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Is there a trial? Yes. Apple will let nonsubscribers try a free 7-day trial of the Apple Music Voice Plan with no auto-renewal. Which devices support the new Apple Music Voice Plan? The Apple Music Voice Plan should work with any Apple device with Siri built-in. It works with the iPhone, iPad, AirPods, Mac, HomePod, Apple TV, and CarPlay.",

    "full_description": "Cryptocurrency has so far failed to sweep away government-issued money, or to bring about the broader revolution that its most ardent enthusiasts envision. But what if the underlying technology could be harnessed to transform traditional fiat currencies \u2014 for example, by making them much easier and cheaper for more people around the world to use? This goal might be attainable \u2014 with help from the governments that crypto was meant to sideline. Ordinary money leaves a lot to be desired. Most people keep it at large banks, which have sometimes used subterfuge and even outright fraud to tax their customers \u2014 and which have proven troublingly fragile in crises. Moving money can take days, particularly if it must wend its way through the antiquated and hackable network of correspondent banks that handles international transfers. For those who don\u2019t have bank accounts \u2014 including millions of Americans, disproportionately Black and Latino \u2014 things are worse. Check cashers, ATMs, card issuers and money transmitters all charge burdensome fees. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, was designed to bypass all this. Anyone with an internet connection could set up a pseudonymous account, controlled with a private key. Users could send digital tokens anywhere, at any time, thanks to a voluntary network of computers that recorded transactions on a public ledger known as a blockchain. High-powered cryptography and decentralization protected against abuse and malfunction. The technology inspired hope not only for a more equitable sort of finance, but also for greater stability: The demise of one or more big global banks would do much less damage if payments could proceed without them. Bitcoin has spawned an entire movement, but it has so far failed as money. Pure cryptocurrencies are far too volatile to be useful except for speculation, illicit trade and the occasional financing of activists in oppressive regimes. The computing power required for the Bitcoin blockchain makes it slow and expensive for smaller transactions, not to mention environmentally damaging. People are afraid to lose the keys to their crypto (about a fifth of all Bitcoin is estimated to have been lost in this way), so they entrust them to wallet apps and other platforms that often get hacked. Most crypto \u201cbelievers\u201d engage through the same types of intermediaries \u2014 exchanges, PayPal, specialized ATMs, opaque trust companies \u2014 that the technology was intended to replace. Many of these businesses are less safe and more expensive than traditional banks. Their rapid growth threatens more financial instability. That said, all is not lost for crypto Despite everything, cryptocurrency innovation may yet deliver a better payment system. Consider stablecoins. They deal with volatility by tying their value to fiat currencies \u2014 implicitly recognizing the biggest defect of pure cryptocurrencies. They can run on blockchains that work more efficiently than Bitcoin and have a smaller carbon footprint. At the moment, they\u2019re mainly used by cryptocurrency speculators to park funds while deciding what to bet on next, or to earn interest in unregulated lending pools. But as a unique form of electronic cash, they have the potential to make transfers easy, instantaneous and cheap. The Facebook-initiated Diem Association, for example, wants to use them to enable payments on mobile apps such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. Ultimately, the infrastructure they use could even provide the rails on which government-issued digital currencies could travel. Another initiative, known as Lightning, seeks to address Bitcoin\u2019s throughput and energy issues by establishing side channels through which multiple payments can be made, with only the final balance recorded on the blockchain. The system has allowed one application, Strike, to use Bitcoin as a utility for remittances between the U.S. and El Salvador. Users\u2019 money can enter as dollars in one country and emerge as dollars in the other, spending practically no time in volatile crypto. Innovations like these have promise \u2014 but they also pose risks that regulators need to address. \u2022 They could trigger runs. Stablecoins redeemable for fiat currencies at fixed rates, and fiat-currency balances in apps such as Strike, need to be securely backed. Often, they aren\u2019t. A recent Bloomberg Businessweek exploration of Tether, the most popular stablecoin with about $70 billion outstanding, found a company \u201cquilted out of red flags.\u201d The lack of clarity \u2014 or a lack of funds \u2014 could one day spook holders, precipitating a crash as everyone rushes for the exits. Regulators should insist on backing in the form of high-quality assets, and ideally in fiat currency. In the U.S., this can be achieved by requiring payment apps and stablecoin issuers to invest only in bank deposits that are in turn held at the Federal Reserve, or by creating a narrowly defined banking license allowing them to open reserve accounts directly with the Fed. \u2022 They could undermine traditional banks. If people could safely keep their money in stablecoins and payment apps, they might stop depositing it at banks, depriving the latter of the resources to make loans. The resulting credit contraction could tank the economy. A recent analysis by the Bank of England suggests that such concerns are overblown. People will likely be slow, its authors say, to adopt new forms of digital money, allowing time for the system to adapt. Still, regulators should err on the side of caution, by forbidding stablecoins and payment apps to pay interest, or by reducing the interest they receive on their deposits at the Fed. Such restrictions could be relaxed later, once officials can assess any threat to banking and credit. \u2022 They could crash or get hacked. It\u2019s one thing for Facebook\u2019s apps to go dark for a day; it would be another if the company were running a global payment system. The newer protocols aren\u2019t yet proven \u2014 as the recent outage of the Solana blockchain demonstrated. Lightning has known vulnerabilities. Regulators should require enough equity capital to absorb surprise losses and set standards for security and governance \u2014 for example, by testing resilience and identifying who\u2019s in charge of handling emergencies. If a company can\u2019t show it would act responsibly, it shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run a payment system. Also, systems should be interoperable, so that a dollar in one can easily be converted into a dollar in another. \u2022 They could abet crime. Crypto platforms usually identify users only with an alphanumeric address. This has made them useful for ransomware developers, tax cheats and other criminals \u2014 and raised concerns that they could undermine international sanctions and anti-money-laundering laws. Platforms and apps can and should demand identification where needed to enforce the law. If regulators required this \u2014 for example, when balances or transactions exceeded certain thresholds \u2014 crypto-enabled payment systems could remain broadly accessible and still be much more transparent than the current banking system. In most cases transactions are already visible on public ledgers, which has helped both law enforcement and the crypto community track down and recover ill-gotten gains. For many, the speculative frenzy surrounding cryptocurrencies won\u2019t end well. Officials such as U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen are right to call for urgent measures to address the mounting risks. But they\u2019re also right not to ban crypto altogether, as China has sought to do. Surging innovation is already driving competition, both private and public, to upgrade a financial system that can certainly stand some improvement. The result could benefit people everywhere \u2014 so long as regulators don\u2019t fall any further behind in guarding against the dangers.",

    "full_description": "The launch and reviews of the Surface Duo 2 may have reignited discussions about dual-screen devices as envisioned by Microsoft. The existence of this smaller Android hybrid device would have naturally also raised questions about its larger Windows counterpart. There has been no official word yet on the fate of the Surface Neo, but new photos of what looks like an unfinished device may spark feelings of nostalgia and longing for a device that may have already been silently canceled. Microsoft revealed both the Surface Duo and the Surface Neo back in 2019, something uncharacteristic for the company. Its early announcement was meant to build interest from developers, but it also ran the risk of generating hype for products that may never hit store shelves. That almost happened to the Surface Duo, which launched later than first intended, but at least the dual-screen phone even got a second generation. The same thing can\u2019t be said of the Surface Neo, which was officially postponed without the promise of a new date. Partly blamed on the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft said that it had to re-evaluate its roadmap for Windows 10X and dual-screen Windows devices, preferring to focus on single-screen PCs for the time being. That focus is what Windows 11 turned out to be, but there has been no sighting of Surface Neo or even its shadow so far. Max Weinbach just surprised tech pundits and Microsoft fans with photos of unexpected photos of the Surface Neo, or at least the makings of one. The device that reportedly came from China didn\u2019t come with a screen, which means you can see directly inside it. As far as internal layout goes, it looks like an enlarged Surface Duo, which was what Microsoft aimed for when it conceptualized the two companions. Neo pic.twitter.com/1RXrh2FSiN \u2014 Max Weinbach (@MaxWinebach) October 24, 2021 Its sudden appearance effectively resurrected discussion about the Surface Neo and its uncertain fate. Given the feedback on the Surface Duo 2, however, some might also be questioning whether the idea would have succeeded in the first place. There have been attempts by other PC makers to produce unconventional computing devices in the same vein, but, aside from the ASUS Precog, the likes of Lenovo seem to prefer a single foldable screen over two separate ones.",

    "full_description": "The industry-wide push to get 5G adopted as fast as possible doesn\u2019t come without costs, even for those who have no intention of moving to the next-gen network yet. As part of upgrading their systems and infrastructures, carriers are also taking the opportunity to sunset old technologies and equipment, from 2G to even some 3G. T-Mobile is similarly using the time to quit using the CDMA technology it inherited from its Sprint acquisition, and it\u2019s moving its deadline for that shutdown next year to give partners like Dish more time to prepare. Shutting down networks is always a tricky deal, but it may have become trickier when some corporate mudslinging is involved, subtly or otherwise. It\u2019s only natural that T-Mobile will want to ditch the CDMA network it didn\u2019t want to use anyway, but that meant disrupting customers and partners that relied on it. It\u2019s giving affected people and especially businesses time to migrate their systems and devices to 4G LTE or, preferably, 5G, and the deadline was initially set for January 1, 2022. Now T-Mobile is announcing that it is giving those partners even more time by extending the date by three months. That means that Sprint\u2019s CDMA network will still be in operation until March 31, 2022. Given that T-Mobile announced its plans to shut the network down last year, it believes that should be enough time for those partners to get ready. Its extension, however, comes with a not-so-subtle jab at unnamed partners that the carrier described as not having followed through on their responsibility. Given a recent public spat between T-Mobile and one such partner, however, it might be clear to industry watchers who that is. It won\u2019t be a surprise if Dish Network fires off its own tirade to add fuel to that fire. Dish bought Boost from T-Mobile to help the latter acquire Sprint. Dish believed that it would have three years to get things in order and migrate its new customers over to 4G or 5G. T-Mobile shattered those expectations when it announced the earlier January 2022 shutdown date, and the two have been public at war ever since.",

    "full_description": "A man has been nabbed by police doing more than double the speed limit in one of the first weekend\u2019s since the end of lockdown. NSW Police say the motorcycle rider was caught doing 224km/h on the M1 motorway near Helensburgh south of Sydney on Sunday morning. The speed limit on this section of road is 110km/h. The roads through and around the Royal National Park south of Sydney are popular with motorbike riders. The 33-years-old rider of the red Ducati Panigale was hit with a $2547 fine and had his licence suspended for six months on the spot according to the NSW Highway Patrol Facebook . Surprisingly the police were unable to impound the motorcycle. Police are unable to impound a vehicle if it is registered to a business or someone other than the rider or driver caught breaking the law. The Ducati Panigale is one of the fastest and powerful road bikes in the world. The Moto GP derived engine makes a whopping 158kW and 124Nm and screams up to 13,000rpm, which is an amazing amount of power for a bike that weighs less than 200kg. To put thar in perspective a high-powered Lamborghini Aventador Supercar has more than 500kW of power but weighs about 1700kg. The high power to weight ratio enables the Ducati to accelerate to 100km/h in a little more than three seconds on the way to a top speed of almost 300km/h. There has been a string of hoon drivers nabbed in the past few weeks since lockdown ended in Sydney. Late last week police caught a driver of a circa-$160,000 BMW M3 doing 200km/h in an 80km/h zone on a busy road in Sydney\u2019s south west. This vehicle wasn\u2019t impounded because it was registered to a business and not the man driving. Police have busted several drivers for excessive speed on the M5 in the past week, including the rider of a Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10 motorcycle who initially tried to flee from officers before pulling over. Police have confirmed a man in his 20s has died following a serious crash in Sydney\u2019s west where he became trapped under a bus. A woman killed in a horror Gold Coast crash that claimed the lives of three people has been identified. A couple who blocked in a car parked on their driveway and insisted on $184 to get it back have been slammed as \u201cmorally bankrupt\u201d.",

The International Astronautical Federation\u2019s 72nd International Astronautical Congress, taking place this week here, included as one of its side events the 11th International Meeting for Members of Parliaments, attracting about 40 individuals from 15 countries. While this was the eleventh such meeting, it took on a new format this year. \u201cIn the past it was speeches from big companies or space agencies,\u201d said Dominique Tilmans, an IAF vice president and former member of the Belgian Senate, during a press conference about the meeting Oct. 24. \u201cWe decided to reshape the meeting by asking parliamentarians to make presentations about space applications.\u201d That new focus, she said, was intended to get them to think more about the benefits of space. \u201cOur goal is to interest more and more parliamentarians in the space sector,\u201d she said. \u201cOur goal is to space understandable and accessible.\u201d The meeting included sessions on the use of space for health, mobility and public services, with attending parliamentarians giving presentations on uses of space in their countries. \u201cSome parliamentarians, before coming to the meeting, were not especially interested in space,\u201d Tilmans said. \u201cWhat we saw was enthusiasm: they understand space is so powerful, so interesting. So, they begin to become very interested in space.\u201d Some participants were already interested in space, including one person who had flown in space. \u201cWe have to see the problem from the perspective of applications or solutions from space,\u201d said Marcos Pontes, Brazil\u2019s minister of science, technology and innovation, who flew to the International Space Station in 2006. \u201cWe can work together to find out how we can use the infrastructure we have, or other countries have.\u201d The meetings discussed best practices about space applications in various fields. It did not, though, go into detail about legal and regulatory issues, including on topics like orbital debris that pose a growing risk to the ability to deliver those space applications. \u201cThere are so many things to discuss, and this is our first meeting in this new version,\u201d Tilmans said. \u201cThis time we decided to discuss practical solutions, space solutions.\u201d Pontes suggested it might be a topic for future meetings. \u201cSpace debris is a really important issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is part of our concerns about the law of space, and how we can work together as countries to get legislation that would be effective.\u201d",

    "full_description": "Scientists thought Bennu's surface was like a sandy beach, abundant in fine sand and pebbles, which would have been perfect for collecting samples. Past telescope observations from Earth had suggested the presence of large swaths of fine-grained material smaller than a few centimeters called fine regolith. But when NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission arrived at Bennu in late 2018, the mission saw a surface covered in boulders. The mysterious lack of fine regolith became even more surprising when mission scientists observed evidence of processes potentially capable of grinding boulders into fine regolith. New research, published in Nature and led by Saverio Cambioni, of the University of Arizona, used machine learning and surface temperature data to solve the mystery. Cambioni conducted the research at the university's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. He and his colleagues ultimately found that Bennu's highly porous rocks are responsible for the surface's surprising lack of fine regolith. \"The 'REx' in OSIRIS-REx stands for Regolith Explorer, so mapping and characterizing the surface of the asteroid was a main goal,\" said study co-author and OSIRIS-REx Principal Investigator Dante Lauretta, a Regents Professor of Planetary Sciences at the University of Arizona. \"The spacecraft collected very high-resolution data for Bennu's entire surface, which was down to 3 millimeters per pixel at some locations. Beyond scientific interest, the lack of fine regolith became a challenge for the mission itself, because the spacecraft was designed to collect such material.\" A Rocky Start and Solid Answers \"When the first images of Bennu came in, we noted some areas where the resolution was not high enough to see whether there were small rocks or fine regolith. We started using our machine learning approach to distinguish fine regolith from rocks using thermal emission (infrared) data,\" Cambioni said. The thermal emission from fine regolith is different from that of larger rocks, because the size of its particles controls the former, while the latter is controlled by rock porosity. The team first built a library of thermal emissions associated with fine regolith mixed in different proportions with rocks of various porosity. Next, they used machine-learning techniques to teach a computer how to \"connect the dots\" between the examples, Cambioni said. They analyzed 122 areas on the surface of Bennu, that were observed both during the day and the night. \"Only machine learning could efficiently explore a dataset this large,\" Cambioni said. Cambioni and his collaborators found something surprising when the data analysis was completed: the fine regolith was not randomly distributed on Bennu. Instead, it was up to several tens of percent in those very few areas where rocks are non-porous, and systematically lower where rocks have higher porosity, which is most of the surface. The team concluded that very little fine regolith is produced from Bennu's highly porous rocks because these are compressed rather than fragmented by meteoroid impacts. Like a sponge, the voids within rocks cushion the blow from incoming meteoroids. These findings are also in agreement with laboratory experiments from other research groups. \"Basically, a big part of the energy of the impact goes into crushing the pores restricting the fragmentation of the rocks and the production of new fine regolith,\" said study co-author Chrysa Avdellidou, a postdoctoral researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) - Lagrange Laboratory of the C\u00f4te d'Azur Observatory and University in France. Additionally, Cambioni and colleagues showed that cracking caused by the heating and cooling of Bennu's rocks as the asteroid rotates through day and night proceeds more slowly in porous rocks than in denser rocks, further frustrating the production of fine regolith. \"When OSIRIS-REx delivers its sample of Bennu (to Earth) in September 2023, scientists will be able to study the samples in detail,\" said Jason Dworkin, OSIRIS-REx project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"This includes testing the physical properties of the rocks to verify this study.\" Other missions have evidence to support the team's findings. The Japan Aerospace and Exploration Agency (JAXA) Hayabusa2 mission to Ryugu, a carbonaceous asteroid like Bennu, found that Ryugu also lacks fine regolith and has high-porosity rocks. Conversely, JAXA's Hayabusa mission in 2005 revealed abundant fine regolith on the surface of asteroid Itokawa, an S-type asteroid with rocks of a different composition than Bennu and Ryugu. A previous study also from Cambioni and colleagues provided evidence that its rocks are less porous than Bennu's and Ryugu's using observations from Earth. \"For decades, astronomers disputed that small, near-Earth asteroids could have bare-rock surfaces,\" said study co-author Marco Delbo, research director with CNRS, also at the Lagrange Laboratory. \"The most indisputable evidence that these small asteroids could have substantial fine regolith emerged when spacecraft visited S-type asteroids Eros and Itokawa in the 2000s and found fine regolith on their surfaces.\" The team predicts that large swaths of fine regolith should be uncommon on carbonaceous asteroids, the most common of all asteroid types observed, and which the team expects to have high-porosity rocks like Bennu. By contrast, they predict terrains rich in fine regolith to be common on S-type asteroids, the second-most populous type of asteroids observed in the solar system, which they expect to have denser, less porous rocks than carbonaceous asteroids. \"This is an important piece in the puzzle of what drives the diversity of asteroids' surfaces,\" Cambioni said. \"Asteroids are thought to be relics of the early solar system, so understanding the evolution they have undergone in time is crucial to comprehend how the solar system formed and evolved. Now that we know this fundamental difference between carbonaceous and S-type asteroids, future teams can better prepare sample collection missions depending on the nature of the target asteroid.\" Cambioni is continuing his research on planetary diversity as a distinguished postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The University of Arizona leads the OSIRIS-REx science team and the mission's science observation planning and data processing. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, provides overall mission management, systems engineering, and the safety and mission assurance for OSIRIS-REx. Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado, built the spacecraft and provides flight operations. Goddard and KinetX Aerospace are responsible for navigating the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. OSIRIS-REx is the third mission in NASA's New Frontiers Program, managed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, for the agency's Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.

    "full_description": "For the sake of Earth and humanity, it\u2019s time for private enterprise and governments to co-invest to expand human activity in low Earth orbit. To some, that will appear to be a preposterous statement. How can human space flight help hard problems on Earth? What justifies public-private investment? For more than 60 years, discretionary tax dollars have underwritten both the exploration of space and the development of technologies needed to travel and work there. Over that same time, our world\u2019s population has more than doubled. The relentlessly increasing demand for energy, materials, land, and waste disposal has severely damaged the only biosphere we have. We know that the unique perspective from space changes how people feel about challenges and conflicts on Earth. And we know that space holds infinite energy, materials, and room to grow. Exploring is only one of four major pursuits to undertake in space. We can also experience space for ourselves as we do by vacationing in exotic locales on Earth. We can exploit the locations, conditions, and resources space has to offer. And ultimately, we can expand civilization into space where we find unlimited resources. While these four possible futures are related, each is animated by unique goals, favors certain destinations, requires specialized technologies, and yields distinct benefits. Human expansion into the solar system will require almost inconceivable investments, sustained over centuries. Only two of the futures move down this path because their economic engines are powered by mass markets: people who want to experience space travel, and commercial enterprises that seek to exploit what space has to offer. Together, these two markets will control the growth rate of our future in space, so they should be the focus of governments interested in promoting economic growth. Fortunately, both markets can take off in low Earth orbit. The International Space Station, multiple Russian space stations before it, Skylab, and now Chinese space stations as well, have all established real markets for permanent national presence and scientific research in orbit. Exploring frontiers is how governments create options. But realizing those options takes commercial enterprise building in the wake of exploration, enabled by public infrastructure and conducive regulations. Now, with the right conditions, commercial interests are poised to build on the government foundation in low Earth orbit by investing in three rich orbital markets. First, sovereign nations around the globe \u2013 those already active in space, but also newcomers that have never had easy access to space \u2013 will pursue an \u201corbital address.\u201d Nations will aim to position themselves on this visible frontier of technology and commerce. And the fundamental research sponsored by NASA and other agencies will continue. Second, a wide range of commercial interests will experiment in and seek profit from the unique orbital environment: hard vacuum, containerless processing, no convection, high energies, and proximity to home. The latent opportunities are endless for technology development, manufacturing at scale, Earth imaging, data processing, advertising, media, sports, and gaming. Third, private space travel is now real. Larger numbers of people will experience space flight\u2019s novel sensations: launch acceleration, re-entry deceleration, free-fall for days or weeks, and the dominating, ever-changing view of Earth. Imagine making commonplace the experience of sixteen sunrises and sunsets per day, while also overflying ninety percent of humanity. Adventurers first, and then orbital residents will visit and occupy space destinations. Why hasn\u2019t this all happened already? First, we need a method to fly payloads and people routinely, safely, and more affordably. Soon, there will be two privately owned, reusable heavy lift launch systems and four reusable space vehicles. Second, we need an accessible orbital destination where entrepreneurs can test their designs and seek their fortunes \u2013 a place that promotes competition. Soon, there will be a commercially developed, owned, and operated space station designed with these markets foremost in mind. Third, we need established space research customers to sign long-term use agreements as anchor tenants to give investors confidence. NASA\u2019s Commercial LEO Destinations program must be funded to develop accommodations for its special needs and structured to make long-term deals. Fourth, we need private capital to make sustained investments with the patience to await the delayed returns from emergent markets. As a founder of the field of space architecture, I\u2019ve worked for a half century to normalize space flight. Space is the ultimate environment in which we can grow and thrive. It is also a domain that reveals \u2013 viscerally \u2013 the limits and interconnectedness of our existence on Earth. Humanity needs a space destination close to home. A place in low Earth orbit where customers can experience space simply by buying a ticket, with all essential services and concierge amenities expertly and safely provided. A place where they can learn to feel at home in this hostile environment, experimenting and inventing new products that markets have yet to imagine. A place where people from around the planet can gaze in awe together through expansive windows across the vacuum of space. A place with an incomparable view of our fragile existence on our only home \u2013 our blue origin. An orbital address will be where it all starts. Brent Sherwood is a space architect with 33 years of experience in the space industry. He is Senior Vice President of Advanced Development Programs for Blue Origin, which develops systems for space transportation, space mobility, space destinations, and lunar permanence. Blue Origin\u2019s mission is to develop infrastructure for millions of people to live and work in space to benefit Earth.",

    "full_description": "A frazzled looking Deputy Prime Minister has hit back at allegations his party has backflipped on its climate policy, saying the Nationals would rather negotiate within the parliament than stand outside in protest. Comparing himself to a Fatboy Slim song, Barnaby Joyce told Sky News the Nationals had been faced with two possibilities ahead of the Prime Minister\u2019s trip to the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow next week \u2013 negotiate or demonstrate. While Mr Joyce is understood to have told colleagues he did not support the target, he was happy to accept the party room majority. Sky News host Laura Jayes asked Mr Joyce whether the Nationals approving a net-zero target emissions by 2050 goal was a sign that the party had \u201ccome a long way\u201d. \u201cA couple years ago, you were warning about $100 roasts. Last election some within your party were warning about electric cars cancelling the weekend \u2026 It\u2019s been quite a journey \u2013 is this the position you thought you'd end up in?\u201d Jayes asked. \u201cIt has been quite a journey, it sounds like a Fatboy Slim song,\u201d Mr Joyce replied, referring to the English musician\u2019s 1998 album You\u2019ve Come a Long Way, Baby. \u201cThings evolve. In politics it\u2019s quite simple. The PM was going to Glasgow, he didn\u2019t need our approval \u2026 (But) we could negotiate or demonstrate. \u201cWe could scream and yell out on the lawns or we could negotiate for a better deal for the people of regional Australia. \u201cThe choice was quite obvious\u201d. Details of the package are yet to be made public; however, it\u2019s understood the Nationals have bargained for a new regional future fund and an extra cabinet position. Twelve Nationals MP were in support of the target, while nine were opposed. Mr Joyce said as signatories on the deal, regional Australians would not be put out by the cut to emissions. \u201cWe\u2019ve made sure in our discussions the regions will be in the same place or better,\u201d Mr Joyce said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made sure that there is no, basically, inflection or caveat that\u2019ll affect coal mining to supply the global demand.\u201d Scott Morrison said on Sunday he welcomed the junior Coalition partner\u2019s in-principle support. \u201cWe recognise this has been a challenging issue for the Nationals. I thank (Mr Joyce) for his leadership and his colleagues for their considered support,\u201d Mr Morrison said in a statement. \u201cI greatly respect the process they have undertaken in reaching this decision. \u201cOnly the Coalition can be trusted to deliver a plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 that will protect and promote rural and regional Australia.\u201d Australia\u2019s deputy PM has told colleagues he does not support the PM's net-zero by 2050 plan, as the trade-off made for Nationals support is revealed. Cracks are emerging in Barnaby Joyce\u2019s net zero \u201cdeal\u201d for the PM with some Nationals MPs confirming they won\u2019t support it. Thousands of leaked documents reportedly show Australia lobbying hard for concessions in a huge UN report.",

For example, Verizon\u2019s 2020 DBIR found that 70% of breaches were caused by outsiders, 45% involved hacking, 86% were financially motivated, 17% involved some form of malware, and 22% featured phishing or social engineering . Top Cybersecurity Statistics, Facts, and Figures for 2021 (fortinet.com) My infographic below can be used as a guiding tool to help plan strategies to help manage cyber-risk. A successful cyber risk strategy requires stepping up assessing situational awareness, information sharing, and especially resilience. Strategic Paths To Cybersecurity Chuck Brooks In 2021, the connectivity of cyber devices grew exponentially and so have the cyber intrusions and threats from malware and hackers. The year is not over and already more data has been breached that ever before. Let us hope that that cyber-attack stats for 2022 may less prolific and costly. \"10 Best Cyber Security and Technology Experts in The world\" Homeland Security Today About the Author: Chuck Brooks, President of Brooks Consulting International, and Adjunct Faculty at Georgetown University, is a Technology Evangelist, Corporate Executive, Speaker, Writer, Government Relations, Business Development, and Marketing Executive.

    "full_description": "Barnaby Joyce has told colleagues he doesn\u2019t support net zero by 2050 despite reaching a new agreement with Prime Minister Scott Morrison overnight to deliver the plan \u2013 if the Nationals get an extra seat in cabinet. Multiple MPs have told news.com.au that the Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce told the Nationals party room that while he didn\u2019t support net zero, he was happy to accept the will of the majority of his colleagues. Overnight, Mr Joyce and Deputy Nationals leader David Littleproud went to dinner at the Lodge to discuss the deal, which is believed to include an extra seat in cabinet for the Nationals that\u2019s likely to go to Keith Pitt, another net zero sceptic. Mr Littleproud refused to say if Mr Joyce personally supported net zero by 2050 when quizzed on ABC television. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into individuals,\u2019\u2019 Mr Littleproud said. Host Michael Rowland shot back, \u201cYou\u2019re his deputy. You should know.\u201d \u201cI do, but I won\u2019t tell you because what happens in our party room stays in the sanctity of that party room,\u2019\u2019 he said. That prompted former prime minister Kevin Rudd to accuse the Nationals of accepting \u201c30 pieces of silver\u201d \u2013 the price Judas Iscariot accepted to betray Jesus. \u201cThis is a political charade. The Nationals will accept their 30 pieces of silver from Morrison this week,\u2019\u2019 Mr Rudd said. \u201cThey are a bunch of political opportunists ready to be bought at any price. The real debate is 2030 targets. Otherwise 2050 carbon neutral is bullsh*t.\u201d But a split has already emerged in the ranks, with Nationals Senator Matt Canavan and NT Senator Sam McMahon raising concerns about the net-zero plan. Asked if Mr Joyce supported net zero, Senator McMahon told news.com.au that she didn\u2019t think he did. \u201cI think he said enough on the public record that I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a massive fan of it,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s going to have any effect on overall global temperatures. But, but, you know if it\u2019s what the majority of the public want, then we have an obligation to deliver that for them. \u201cMy view is that I don\u2019t support it from the point of view that whatever we do in Australia is going to have absolutely no impact on global emissions, and global temperature changes. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the public record numerous times saying that I, I support the adaptation of nuclear energy.\u201d Speaking after the meeting, Senator Canavan confirmed that he still believed it was a \u201cbad deal\u201d. On social media, he has been posting images suggesting Australians will only be able to eat \u201c14 grams of meat\u201d under net zero. \u201cTo reach the Liberals\u2019 net zero plan, the UN says we can only eat 14g of meat a day. Don\u2019t eat it all at once!,\u2019\u2019 he said. Senator Canavan said he wouldn\u2019t be supporting the plan. \u201cNet zero will be a bad deal for Australia because it will send jobs and industry to China just as we face greater risks of conflict. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the decision. I let the room know yesterday that I will \u2013 as I say, I\u2019ll continue to fight for the blue-collar workers of this country. Mr Morrison said he welcomed what he described as the Nationals\u2019 in-principle support for the commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. \u201cWe recognise this has been a challenging issue for the Nationals. I thank the DPM for his leadership and his colleagues for their considered support. I greatly respect the process they have undertaken in reaching this decision,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cOnly the Coalition can be trusted to deliver a plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 that will protect and promote rural and regional Australia. \u201cEnsuring regional Australia continues to grow and prosper is a core objective of any Coalition Government, and this will be central to our plan. \u201cAustralia will continue to reduce emissions while keeping our economy growing, maintaining affordable, reliable energy and ensuring our regions remain strong.\u201d Cracks are emerging in Barnaby Joyce\u2019s net zero \u201cdeal\u201d for the PM with some Nationals MPs confirming they won\u2019t support it. Thousands of leaked documents reportedly show Australia lobbying hard for concessions in a huge UN report. Claims that the Nationals will be paid out with $250 billion by the government for agreeing to net zero have been slammed.",

    "description": "It is nearly 15 years since the then taoiseach Bertie Ahern departed from his scripted address to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu) and wondered aloud why critics of his \u201cCeltic tiger\u201d economic model did not kill themselves. Within a short period the fears of these critics materialised. The economic crash that followed changed the world of work. The numbers in employment fell from 2.169 million in the third quarter of 2007 to 1.825 million at its lowest point in early 2012.Across the public service there were two, and in some cases three, separate pay cuts imposed. The post-crash austerity also swept away the system of social partnership which for more than two decades had given trade unions (and some employer groups) huge influence, not just over the levels of pay rises but also across a large range of social, political and economic issues. While there have been some torrid times for the trade union movement over the past 12 years or so, when Ictu meets in conference in Belfast this week it will do so in a more positive environment than in a considerable period of time. Covid-19 transformed the world of work again. It led to work practice reforms and flexibilities that would have proved impossible to achieve or at the very least involved years of tortuous negotiations. Hundreds of thousands of workers left their offices and embraced technology to continue doing their jobs. State employees were redeployed to different roles virtually overnight, while health service personnel left the public system to provide services in private sector nursing homes, as did Defence Force members. However, the pandemic has also led to a major change in the attitude of Government to the world of work and to workers\u2019 rights. In a series of speeches over recent months T\u00e1naiste Leo Varadkar has argued that one of the legacies of the pandemic must be better terms and conditions. In sentiments that could have been articulated by David Begg, Jack O\u2019Connor, Patricia King or many of the main trade union leaders over recent years, he has backed a move to a living wage, the need for access to an occupational pension, the right to disconnect from work, the right to seek remote working arrangements and for new legislation for statutory sick pay arrangements. However, for the unions the big announcement by Varadkar was the establishment of a high-level group to look at collective bargaining and industrial relations. Constitutional right Traditionally Ireland has followed what is known as a voluntarist system of industrial relations. Workers had a constitutional right to join a trade union. However, employers equally had a right not to recognise or engage with trade unions. The new review group is looking at the issue of trade union recognition and its implications for collective bargaining, as well as considering any legal or constitutional issues. Unions had been campaigning for years for collective bargaining rights but there seemed little appetite for change on the part of successive governments. Whether anything substantial emerges from the new process remains to be seen. However, for the unions getting the Government into a space where it would establish a group to look at potential reforms in this area represented a step forward. The trade union movement would appear to have emerged relatively unscathed from the past 18 months in terms of workers it represents Some observers have questioned the motivation of Varadkar, and wondered if he has an eye on closing off potential avenues of political attack from Sinn F\u00e9in, which has championed workers\u2019 rights for many years. However, unions are likely to watch carefully to see the tangible benefits on the ground from the various measures, particularly for the more vulnerable groups of workers in the private sector. The conference this week is likely to hear about the role Ictu played as the voice for all workers during the pandemic, not just those represented by a trade union. A lot of this work was carried out under the auspices of the Labour Employer Economic Forum. The LEEF, as it is known, was considered a dim echo of social partnership and provided a vehicle role for employers, unions and the Government to discuss issues such as competitiveness, job-creation and labour market standards. However, during Covid-19 it evolved significantly, and played a key role in drawing up the return-to-work protocols after the various Covid-19 lockdowns. It is likely to also provide a forum for key talks on the Government\u2019s controversial plans for some form of \u201crecognition\u201d for workers for their role during the pandemic. Unchanged The trade union movement itself would appear to have emerged relatively unscathed from the past 18 months of the pandemic in terms of workers it represents. Ictu is made up of about 45 affiliate organisations which collectively represent just under 800,000 workers across the island of Ireland. It is understood that while numbers in some unions fell slightly during the pandemic, there was a corresponding increase in others, leaving the total relatively unchanged since the last Ictu conference in 2018. However the movement also faces challenges in a number of areas. Earlier this year Kevin Callinan, the head of the trade union F\u00f3rsa and the incoming Ictu president, warned it needed to make itself relevant to tens of thousands of workers in the technology and pharmaceutical sectors, as well as the gig economy who had to an extent been effectively ignored. He also urged that the unions needed to \u201cget serious\u201d about implementing internal structural reform plans drawn up nearly a decade ago. \u201cAt the core of the report was the view that we should move to a much smaller number of sectoral unions, and that we should pool resources as far as possible. I want to initiate a fresh attempt to put these exhortations into practice. We know that avoiding them is not making us any stronger.\u201d One of the key examples of this rationalisation plan in action was the establishment of F\u00f3rsa which came about from the amalgamation of three public and civil service unions and is now the largest representative organisation in the State sector with close to 90,000 members. However, progress elsewhere has been slow, and recent acrimony between teaching unions would suggest that in some areas rather than moving closer together divisions between organisations are deeper than ever.

    "full_description": "A former high-profile New Zealand television and radio presenter has taken aim at the government and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in a controversial and bizarre anti-vaccine rant. Former Breakfast, Good Morning and Radio NZ presenter Liz Gunn made the emotional claims, saying Friday\u2019s earthquake that hit the central North Island was Mother Nature\u2019s response to Ardern\u2019s new vaccine mandates. In a video online, Gunn relayed a message saying the worst part of the newly-announced system \u2014 which maintains stricter restrictions for the unvaccinated \u2014 is its ability to \u201cseparate us\u201d from one another. The former presenter then hit out at Ardern claiming mandatory vaccinations are \u201crape\u201d and that Mother Earth is rising up against a \u201ctyrannical\u201d leader. \u201cOur mother, our jewel, this beautiful country said enough! Enough!\u201d Gunn said. \u201cI need other mothers to stand and with them the men who love their strength and power.\u201d She then accused the Government of poisoning New Zealand\u2019s children and the nation. \u201cBecause it is the mothers who know what is going on. The poisoning of our children, the poisoning of our air, the poisoning of our waters. The poisoning of New Zealand with these terrible ideas,\u201d she said. \u201cThese completely misguided lies Ardern is telling us. The poisoning with arrogant tyrannical leaders. All of this is it stops with this earthquake. That\u2019s what our mother was explaining to us. We must listen to her. Even those who think Ardern is amazing. \u201cStop and think, what will this country be like in a generation or two generations if a leader like this is allowed to jab rape. Because it is rape to force something in someone\u2019s body.\u201d Her video was posted on Saturday. In it, she also said the introduction of vaccine passports was a way to divide the nation and segregate people with different vaccine statuses from one another. Who is Liz Gunn? Gunn had previously been with TVNZ between 1990 and 2003. She was part of the original TVNZ Breakfast team alongside Mike Hosking and Susan Wood in 1997. In 2001, Gunn took Alison Mau\u2019s place as host, forming a team alongside Hosking. But she sparked headlines in December that year when she quit the program live on air. At the time, it was reported that Gunn and Hosking had not clicked as a presenting team but TVNZ bosses were left scrambling when Gunn told viewers she wouldn\u2019t be back in 2002. During that time, Gunn also worked at Radio New Zealand, hosting a number of shows before finishing up in 2016. She now is an executive producer and presenter for a creative content agency. Antivaxxers be like: Jacinda was the reason for the earthquake pic.twitter.com/nKkSIw6qIp Her rant comes after Ardern announced on Friday that New Zealand would move to a traffic light system to manage Covid-19 when District Health Boards have 90 per cent of their eligible population vaccinated. When each DHB hit this target, the new framework would come into effect. The traffic light system makes use of vaccine certificates. Businesses will be able to continue to operate at each of the risk levels, and each setting can be used in a highly targeted and localised way, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said. However, she warned those who aren\u2019t vaccinated they won\u2019t be able to share in some of the freedoms other Kiwis enjoy. \u201cVaccinations are our armour,\u201d Ardern said when announcing the target and new traffic light system. \u201cThey help keep us safe. If you want summer, get vaccinated. If you want a haircut, get vaccinated. If you want to go to a gym or a sports event, get vaccinated. If you\u2019re not vaccinated, there will be everyday things that you will miss out on,\u201d Ardern said. How New Zealand\u2019s traffic light system will work Red is for when the virus is spreading in a way that threatens the most vulnerable and could overwhelm the health system. Education will be open but with public health measures, masks will be needed and there will be caps and physical distancing requirements. At the red level, someone without a vaccine certificate cannot dine at a restaurant, attend a gathering of more than 10 people or go to the gym. Auckland will move into red when each of its three DHBs hit the 90 per cent target. \u201cYou are so close. Right now you\u2019re just 16,000 vaccines away from every DHB hitting 90 per cent for first doses.\u201d The rest of the country will move to orange when every other DHB hits the 90 per cent target. Orange means no limits if vaccine certificates are used for hospitality, gatherings and events. Limits will apply if no vaccine certificates are used. Green will have limits if no vaccine certificates are used for hospitality, gatherings and events. \u201cIt is quite simple: if you are a business that chooses to use vaccine certificates, you will get to operate at every level,\u201d Ardern said. Ardern said the Government gave a lot of consideration to how religious groups and marae could gather and that is why it was only fair they could use vaccine certificates to ensure they are able to continue getting together. Some countries have not included faith-based groups in their vaccine certificate systems. Those that chose not to use the vaccine-based system would face tougher gathering restrictions. Ardern said the new framework was about being able to live our lives as safely as possible. The alert level system could still be used if it was needed again, but a new playbook was needed in the context of vaccines \u2013 and that\u2019s what the traffic light system is. \u201cI have no doubt we will do what it takes once again, and move forward safely together.\u201d She said the strategy is \u201cto minimise and protect\u201d. \u2014 New Zealand Herald After copping a beating last week, more unpredictable weather is on its way with wild storms to lash Queensland. Australia\u2019s deputy PM has told colleagues he does not support the PM's net-zero by 2050 plan, as the trade-off made for Nationals support is revealed. Cracks are emerging in Barnaby Joyce\u2019s net zero \u201cdeal\u201d for the PM with some Nationals MPs confirming they won\u2019t support it.",

It was one of the first nations to successfully issue lock-downs, pursue contact tracing, and develop a robust federal infrastructure dedicated towards fighting the spread of the disease. However, this year has been challenging for the country, especially as the infamous Delta variant became more prevalent. India is home to nearly 1.4 billion people. Amidst the immense population, bustling economy, and deeply rooted cultural paradigms that define the nation, there is also a relative respect for health, science, and self-betterment. That is, India has always been an epicenter for healthcare innovation and holistic medicine, in addition to being the modern day mecca for the world\u2019s pharmaceutical needs . But India\u2019s latest milestone is something for the history books: achieving 1 billion vaccinations in less than a year. This means that nearly 75% of the population has received at least one dose of the vaccine, providing incredible hope for the future of the country\u2019s fight against the pandemic. For sake of comparison, in the USA, 66.6% of the population has currently received atleast one dose, and in Canada, 77% of the population has received atleast one dose.

One of the foremost problems that the nation continues to face is an incredibly large population\u2014 an issue which often creates challenges that other countries may take for granted, such as vaccine distribution.

(Photo by INDRANIL MUKHERJEE / AFP) (Photo by INDRANIL MUKHERJEE/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images Compound these supply-chain issues with: a large part of the population living outside of big, metropolitan areas; a much younger, though advanced, infrastructure system; and an incredibly diverse yet largely people-driven economy\u2014 and one realizes the challenges that India faces on a daily basis. This is why a feat such as achieving 1 billion vaccinations cannot be taken for granted in a place like India\u2014it simply isn\u2019t the same as achieving the same percentage in the USA, or Canada. There are a far different set of intricate nuances to consider. Understanding these nuances brings forth a renewed appreciation for the achievement. Overall, the milestone also perfectly encapsulates India\u2019s dual interests. While cultural norms and deeply historic roots are pervasive throughout Indian culture, there is also a strong commitment towards innovation, science, and preservation of health. India is home to some of the most advanced healthcare innovation, research and development, and medical technologies in the world. It\u2019s the world\u2019s largest vaccine producer (even prior to Covid), and has forged incredible pathways into robotics, telemedicine, and preventative care. And perhaps most importantly with regards to modern healthcare, the government is committed to embracing cutting-edge digital health strategies . Overall, India is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to research and development on multiple fronts, but especially with regards to science and innovation. Time will tell what will happen in the coming months and years with regards to the Covid-19 Coronavirus pandemic. India, like every other country, is not immune to the constant ebbs-and-flows of the virus; just when case counts start to drop, new variants emerge or new outbreaks occur, sending entire countries back into surge protocols. However, with the information that the world has on hand currently, and based on the current knowledge-base and recommendations provided by public health officials, this milestone marks a promising effort by India in its fight against the virus.",

    "full_description": "Colombia\u2019s most-wanted drug trafficker \u201cOtoniel\u201d has been captured, officials said Saturday, a major victory for the government of the world\u2019s top cocaine exporter. Dairo Antonio Usuga, who headed the country\u2019s largest narco-trafficking gang known as the Gulf Clan, was captured near one of his main outposts in Necocli, near the border with Panama. Images released by the government showed the 50-year-old Otoniel in handcuffs and surrounded by soldiers. \u201cThis is the hardest strike to drug trafficking in our country this century,\u201d president Ivan Duque said in a message, adding that the arrest was \u201conly comparable to the fall of Pablo Escobar,\u201d the notorious Colombian narco-trafficking kingpin. Some 500 soldiers backed by 22 helicopters were deployed in the Necocli municipality to carry out the operation, which left one police officer dead. It was \u201cthe biggest penetration of the jungle ever seen in the military history of our country\u201d, Duque said. A live broadcast by the police later showed a handcuffed Otoniel landing in Bogota before being taken into custody under heavy security. Colombia\u2019s police chief Jorge Vargas said during a press conference that authorities carried out \u201can important satellite operation with agencies of the United States and the United Kingdom.\u201d According to police, Otoniel was hiding in the jungle in the Uraba region, where he is from, and did not use a telephone, relying on couriers to communicate. Fearful of authorities, he \u201cslept there in the rain, never approaching inhabited areas,\u201d Vargas said. The United States had offered a $5 million bounty for information leading to the arrest of Otoniel, one of the most feared men in Colombia. He was indicted in the United States in 2009, and faces extradition proceedings to the country, where he would appear in the Southern District of New York federal court. The Colombian government blames the group \u2014 financed mainly through drug trafficking, illegal mining and extortion \u2014 for being one of the main drivers of the worst bout of nationwide violence since the signing of a peace pact with FARC guerillas in 2016. The Gulf Clan is present in almost 300 municipalities in the country, according to the independent think tank Indepaz. However, recent government efforts have seen the organisation decimated. Although Otoniel announced in 2017 he intended to reach an agreement to participate with the Colombian justice system, the government responded by deploying at least 1,000 soldiers to hunt him down. He took over the leadership of the Gulf Clan \u2014 previously known as the Usuga Clan \u2014 from his brother Juan de Dios, who was killed by police in 2012. Born to a poor family, Otoniel joined the Popular Liberation Army (EPL), a Marxist guerrilla group that demobilised in 1991. After laying down his arms, he later returned to fighting, joining far-right paramilitary groups. Many of these were demobilised in 2006 at the initiative of former right-wing president Alvaro Uribe\u2019s administration, but Otoniel decided to remain in the fight. Colombia is the world\u2019s top producer of cocaine, with the United States as its principal market, despite half a century of efforts to clamp down on the drug trade. In remote areas where there is little government presence, criminal groups like the Gulf Clan, dissident FARC guerillas and leftist ELN rebels fight bloody turf battles to control drug trafficking corridors and illegal mining operations. \u2014 AFP Footage showing an army veteran dealing with a would-be armed robber has gone viral after he swiftly dealt with the situation. China tested two hypersonic \u201cspace nukes\u201d earlier this year that demonstrated technology the US is struggling to understand. A mysterious submarine collision that the US kept \u201csecret\u201d has led to a war of words between America and China.",

    "full_description": "Runescape developer Jagex 's publishing wing has picked up a promising indie release for its Jagex Partners label, making Melvor Idle an indie no longer. The idler game, similar to games like Clicker Heroes or Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms , released on Steam last year and wears its influences from Jagex's flagship Runescape very proudly. Melvor Idle is a detailed, multi-track idle game that seeks to reimagine \"the core components of the RuneScape franchise in a way that they could be enjoyed casually,\" says the publisher. It's a fairly feature-rich idle game, one that has a lot of things to craft and progress, as well as an emphasis on zero prestige mechanics requiring a game restart. Jagex apparently became aware of the project in early 2020, and a lot of the publisher's staff were fans of it after its official Steam launch in October of that year. As you can imagine, the developer is pretty happy to be hooked up with the creators of one of their favorite games. \u201cBeing able to work with Jagex directly on this has been a dream come true,\" said Brendan Malcolm, the solo developer behind Melvor Idle studio Games by Malcs. Malcolm posted a long Q&A to the game's Reddit community, making clear that he would maintain complete creative control moving forward and that the game's single-purchase monetization model wouldn't change. Jagex, he said, had \"no desire\" to change anything about Melvor Idle. The publishing agreement will see Jagex take on the marketing, localisation, tech support, and QA for Melvor Idle. You can try out Melvor Idle for free on its official website and buy it on Steam. I've popped it open while writing this story and I am already very good at chopping down trees.",

The solar producers pay farmers to ship their sheep over to their operations, and the sheep chow down on the weeds and other plants that might grow to the point they block the Sun from reaching the panels. The sheep get fed, the farmers get paid, and the solar producers have their vegetation managed without using mowers and weed whackers\u2014which can sometimes struggle to reach beneath the panels and use fossil fuels\u2014or herbicides. This industry has been expanding in New York state since 2017, according to a report by the American Solar Grazing Association (ASGA). The report notes that the Empire State currently has 900 acres of solar energy-producing land being grazed. But there\u2019s still plenty of room to grow. Advertisement Why sheep? Currently, not much lamb or mutton is produced in the US. According to the USDA , more than half of this meat is imported from New Zealand and Australia. As such, having sheep graze alongside solar panels could be a bit of a growth sector\u2014and not just for meat, as sheep also produce wool and milk. Schmit noted that, although the US doesn\u2019t currently consume much sheep\u2019s meat, the domestic market is growing. Raising the livestock in the US could also bolster local economies. There are a few reasons sheep are the superior choice for grazing on solar farms. For one, they are shorter than cows and horses. They will also eat most kinds of forage, which helps keep plant growth at bay. Goats, on the other hand, will chew pretty much anything, which is a bit of a risk on solar farms. \u201cCows and horses are too big, so they can do damages by rubbing on the panels,\u201d Schmit said. \u201cGoats will eat the wires; sheep won\u2019t. Go figure. Sheep are like the perfect medium for this.\u201d Sunny disposition Recently, Schmit received $500,000 in funding (half from Cornell, the other half from the USDA) over three years. The funding is to help expand the solar-sheep practice through the creation of either a business cooperative or producer-owned organization. The project is called \u201cA New Dawn for Shepherds: Grazing Sheep Under Utility-Scale Solar Arrays.\u201d Schmit is partnering with various farmers, solar industry professionals, and the ASGA, which is a nonprofit organization that connects sheep farmers with solar producers. Together, they will determine what form New Dawn will take and what it will offer to farmers either hoping to expand their sheep production on solar farms or get started doing it. Advertisement The process will involve interviewing the farmers\u2014both current and prospective\u2014about their common needs and goals as well as their common vision for the organization. Schmit and his team will also speak with solar producers to get a sense of what they would like to see from the organization. The form the organization will take and what it will provide are still being determined. According to Schmit, generally speaking, solar operations would rather just deal with a single entity rather than multiple farms. So the organization could be a kind of point of contact between them and the shepherds. It could also help the shepherds with contract negotiations, marketing, planning, deliveries, and logistics, among other things. However, reaching a consensus among the farmers will take some time. \u201cConsensus drives participation,\u201d Schmit told Ars. \u201cConsensus drives investment. Consensus drives more interest in the project.\u201d Wool they or won\u2019t they? (Pun completely intended that time.) Schmit added that, although New Dawn is focused more on New York and the American Northeast, throughout the process, he and his team will be developing tools, guides, financial feasibility templates, etc., that can be used by other groups hoping to start similar organizations elsewhere. \u201cAt the end of the day, we want to be able to develop things that industries, farms, developers can use. Not everyone has to start at zero,\u201d he said. ASGA co-founder Lexie Hain said that the business co-op could potentially establish biosecurity protocols. If sheep from different farms mingle, they could potentially spread diseases, which is an issue that might need addressing. The organization could also potentially bargain for cheaper insurance and help suss out details around transit. According to Hain, solar grazing is still a young field, but farmers and solar operators are becoming increasingly interested. The ASGA only formally began in 2019, but as of last February, it had 246 members, made up of various solar and sheep industry professionals. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of interest in it, and there\u2019s a lot of potential,\u201d she told Ars.",

The result is the aptly named Nerf LMTD Halo Needler . \"This Nerf dart blaster recreates the blaster's distinctive design with flexible needles that light up when you grip the handle!\" Nerf says on its product page. \"Fire the darts and watch the needles go dark to simulate how they launch from the blaster in the game. Other light-up accents add to the exciting visual presentation.\" The Nerf LMTD Halo Needler will ship with 10 official Nerf Elite foam darts\u2014all of which can be loaded into the revolving drum at once\u2014and a display stand. The replica can also be set to a display mode \"so you can activate all the light-up features and place the blaster on the included stand to create an eye-popping display,\" Nerf says, as long as you have the necessary batteries. Nerf says the replica will also come with \"a card with a code to unlock in-game content in the Halo Infinite game\" but doesn't specify what exactly that content will be. (If we had to guess, we'd say that Nerf-themed skins would be an obvious possibility, especially since they wouldn't have to be limited to the Needler.) We should find out more when the product starts to ship. This isn't Nerf's first Needler replica. The company also made the Nerf MicroShots Halo Needler Blaster , which costs just $11, but the difference in quality between the products is obvious. The Nerf MicroShots replica is a hand-loaded blaster that doesn't feature any lights and only loosely resembles the in-game weapon. The Nerf LMTD version is significantly more extravagant. It also has the price to match: the Nerf LMTD Halo Needler costs $100. Nerf is accepting pre-orders until Dec. 31, but the company says customers won't be charged until the product is ready to ship, which it doesn't expect to be until sometime around November 2022. That's a bit late for a Halo Infinite tie-in, given the game's Dec. 8 release date, but so it goes.",

    "full_description": "Electric car customers are set to have a fresh option when BYD opens its doors to customers in coming weeks. China\u2019s \u201cBuild Your Dreams\u201d will open a local showroom in Sydney in late 2021 as part of a deal with local importer Nexport Mobility. The company is set to offer an electric SUV to rival MG\u2019s ZS EV or the Hyundai Kona and Kia Niro electric duo in 2022. Already on sale overseas as the BYD Yuan Plus, the machine combines a 150kW/310Nm electric motor with an impressive battery pack offering more than 400 kilometres of range. Tipped to go on sale for less than $40,000 drive-away, the Yuan Plus could become Australia\u2019s most affordable electric car. Nexport chief executive Luke Todd says the introduction of BYD \u201cwill be the tipping point where EVs will become mainstream with a better price and better quality of car\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the first company to bring in high quality EVs at price parity to internal combustion vehicles,\u201d he said. \u201cReally for mainstream EV to be taken up in sizeable numbers, vehicles have to be desirable and one of those key aspects is to do everything a petrol car will do at the same price if not better.\u201d BYD initially planned to introduce the even cheaper EA1 hatchback, also known as the Dolphin, this year. The compact machine is available with a range of batteries overseas that include a premium variant serving up 70kW of power and 300 kilometres of range. Todd says the booming popularity of SUVs in Australia makes the Yuan Plus a more relevant machine than the Dolphin. \u201cWe think that will spark Australians interest more than a smaller hatch,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll be taking orders this year ahead of delivery in Q2 next year. Our experience centre in Sydney will be open this year.\u201d Nexport Mobility will sell cars directly to customers rather than working with established dealer networks. The company is a significant player in the growing electric bus segment and has already sold relatively small numbers of BYD machines in Australia. BYD\u2019s sharply priced E6 wagon combines a 70kW/180Nm electric motor with a 71.7kWh battery offering up to 520 kilometres of range for $39,990 plus on-road costs, or about $43,000 drive-away. The commercial BYD T3 van is even cheaper at $34,950 plus on-road costs, which translates to less than $38,000 on the road in NSW and Victoria. Powered by a 100kW motor, the T3 has up to 300 kilometres of range and a 700 kilogram cargo capacity. Choosing a new ride isn\u2019t easy, particularly if you\u2019re taller - or smaller - than average. But there are great options that are worth a closer look. Highway patrol officers were dumbfounded by a BMW driver\u2019s response after he blasted past cars at extraordinary speed on a public road. If you\u2019re planning a trip around Australia with family or friends, there aren\u2019t many cars that would do a better job than this one.",

    "full_description": "Ahead of the big Pixel Fall Launch event tomorrow, Google and Japanese artist Kaze Fujii are teasing a music video shot on the Pixel 6. Update: The full music video for \u201cMO-EH-YO,\u201d shot on the Google Pixel 6, is now available. Up to this point, the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro have leaked almost in their entirety, between specs, benchmarks, pricing leaks, and even Google themselves showcasing the phone\u2019s design. One thing that we haven\u2019t seen much of is just how capable the Pixel 6 is for taking photos and videos, outside of a sole set of examples taken in far-from-ideal conditions. As spotted by This is Tech Today , we have our first official look at video taken on a Pixel 6 series device, thanks to a music video coming soon from Kaze Fujii. While the full video doesn\u2019t release until October 24, well after Google takes the wraps off the phone, Fujii has shared a teaser for \u201cMO-EH-YO\u201d (or \u201cIgnite\u201d) which appears to feature 15 seconds of footage from the Pixel 6. Unfortunately, there\u2019s not too much we can tell about the Pixel 6\u2019s camera quality from the teaser video, particularly because it\u2019s entirely in black and white. The teaser is also not available in 4K, making it harder to see the full potential details that could be present. That said, from what we do have, the fine details in Fujii\u2019s hair and jacket seem to be crisp and well-defined, even in motion. While far from a definitive look at the Pixel 6 camera, this music video\u2019s early tease shows promise for Google\u2019s video capabilities this year. Interestingly, as explained on Google\u2019s promotional website , the music video\u2019s debut on YouTube will be preceded by a series of five 30-second shorts that play in sequence across five different television channels in larger cities of Japan, forming a \u201cprologue\u201d to the video. It\u2019s likely this prologue is also shot with the Pixel 6, just like the main video, though that isn\u2019t confirmed on the page. Update 10/24 : Right on schedule, Google and Kaze Fujii have released the full four and a half minute music video for \u201cMO-EH-YO,\u201d giving us the longest example yet of video from the Pixel 6 series ahead of its release on October 28. While the video footage was indeed shot on the Pixel 6, it\u2019s important to remember that, being a prominent music video, high-end equipment like gimbals and cranes were likely in use, as well as professional editing of the footage. That said, there are certainly a lot of aspects of the \u201cMO-EH-YO\u201d music video that speak to the Pixel 6\u2019s video prowess, including the level of visible detail in the city scenes and the impressive bokeh in closeup shots. Unfortunately, there\u2019s only so much we can judge from the video, as it is only available in 1080p, while the Pixel 6 is capable of filming at up to 4K. It\u2019s not clear precisely which model the music video and teaser were shot on. The promotional website almost exclusively refers to the \u201cGoogle Pixel 6,\u201d but imagery on the site shows the higher-end Pixel 6 Pro. This is not the first time that Google has done a special promotion for the Pixel 6 in Japan. Last month, the company celebrated the upcoming debut of Google-made Tensor chips by releasing bags of \u201c Google Original [Potato] Chips .\u201d This article originally had the headline \u201cGoogle teases Japanese music video shot with the Pixel 6\u201d More on Pixel 6: What do you want to know most about the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro?

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin While most filmmakers would insist that their movies deserve to be seen on the big screen, in the case of Dune , Director Denis Villeneuve has a point. A very good point. Indeed, having seen it yesterday in an IMAX laser screen, Dune is arguably the ultimate \u201clarge format\u201d movie I\u2019ve ever seen. Based on the classic Frank Herbert\u2019s classic 1965 novel, the film has a scope and scale that is beyond the majority of narratives \u2013 and attempting to get it onto the big screen has been one of the great cinematic challenges. Famously, cult film director Alejandro Jodorowsky tried hard to get the movie made in the 1970s, and as a 2013 documentary depicts , its script, storyboards, and concept art were completed but with a script that was estimated to run to a 14-hour film, and a cast including Salvador Dali, it never got off the ground. Filmed For IMAX has rarely meant more than for Dune. IMAX In 1982 Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis bought the lapsed rights and in 1984 David\u2019s Lynch\u2019s version of the movie made it to the screen \u2013 and it has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s a mess, albeit a spectacular one, and Lynch himself virtually disowns the movie these days, claiming that he never got final cut. And indeed, while the production design and costumes are phenomenal, the movie is marred by baffling characterisations and off narrative pacing. Enter Villeneuve, who declared bringing his version of Dune to the screen was a lifelong dream. He earned the right to take it on as a result of movies such as Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, showcasing his ability is combining astonishing visuals with powerful, contemplative themes. With Dune has done it again. It\u2019s arguably his most beautiful movie, and Hans Zimmer\u2019s score provides suitable accompaniment to the immersive visuals. Lensed by cinematographer Greig Fraser, who in 2016 worked on both Lion and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story , the production was part of the \u201cFilmed In IMAX\u201d progra mme, which means it used the Arri Alexa 65mm digital large-format camera. (Fraser also has won an Emmy for his work on an episode on the Disney+ Star Wars series, The Mandalorian \u2013 so I\u2019m excited that\u2019s he\u2019s also behind the camera for the upcoming The Batman ). MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event On Dune , around one hour of the 2-hour 35 minute movie was shot using the Arri Alexa camera, which means that there\u2019s enough resolution for creating scenes to be framed in IMAX\u2019s exclusive 1:43:1 aspect ratio, where the screen add huge amounts of picture above and below the regular widescreen image. However, as film prints are not being made for Dune, only IMAX theatres with both a dual-laser \u201cGT\u201d projector and an extra tall 1.43:1 aspect ratio screen can show the movie in this format. In the UK, there are only two cinemas that meet these criteria \u2013 the Science Museum in London and the Vue Manchester Printworks and. Sadly, the former is not currently showing commercial movies ( complain here ), leaving just the latter for cinema purists. Every other digital IMAX theatre will be able to open up the expanded aspect ratio up to 1.90:1 \u2013 which is not as tall as 1.43 but still gives noticeably more picture than regular 2.40:1. Aside from the Vue Manchester Printworks and Science Museum, there are only four IMAX screens equipped with laser projectors: Sheffield, London Leicester Square, Watford, York \u2013 and these do make a significant improvement to the picture quality over their Xenon-lamp based brethren. Either way, if you can make it to an IMAX to see Dune \u2013 do \u2013 it will be worth making the effort. This journalist saw an early screening of the film, but and came out knowing that he should have waited \u2013 knowing that seeing a cropped version, with less impactful sound, wasn\u2019t the best way to see this modern classic. It\u2019s the way Villeneuve frames the shots \u2013 it\u2019s the size of the ships in space and as they land on the planets, but it\u2019s also the power of the close-ups. Dune isn\u2019t really about ships and space \u2013 it\u2019s about political power \u2013 a Game of Thrones in space, and that is more about people than special effects. As this thread on Reddit puts it , \u201cHonestly, they'r [sic] two different movies. Watch Dune in IMAX if you can [sic]\u201d. And if you think you have a long way to go, quit complaining, as you probably won\u2019t outdo this chap who travelled 1000 miles to see it in 1.43:1 with dual laser . Now that\u2019s commitment. It\u2019s no surprise then that Villeneuve himself has decried the fact that Warner Bros. has decided to release Dune on HBO Max simultaneously as in theatres. And with the best will in the world, if seeing it in a standard theatre doesn\u2019t do Dune justice, how much more so for the people who are watching it at home. And no, your 65in TV is not the same as seeing it an IMAX. As he told Variety, \u201cFrankly, to watch Dune on a television, the best way I can compare it is to drive a speedboat in your bathtub,\u201d the director told Total Film . \u201cFor me, it\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s a movie that has been made as a tribute to the big-screen experience.\u201d He\u2019s not wrong. If you can\u2019t get to an IMAX, then, look to see if there\u2019s a Dolby Cinema near you. No, you won\u2019t get the benefit of the expanded aspect ratio, which is a big downer - but compared to anyone regular screen you\u2019ll be doing a lot better \u2013 Dolby offers immaculate picture quality which will do the sun-drenched deserts and blackness of space justice. Failing that, seek out any other large-format screen, such as a \u201cSuperscreen\u201d, iSense, or IMPACT \u2013 where you\u2019ll get 4K sound and Dolby Atmos sound. After all, as Villeneuve told Deadline, \u201cWhen you watch this movie on the big screen, it\u2019s almost a physical experience. We designed the movie to be as immersive as possible, and for me, the big screen is part of the language.\u201d Having seen the film, I can only agree and as this is only part one, whether they can make part two will depend on people going to see it. So, let\u2019s make it happen. Go see Dune in a cinema, and if you possibly can, make it a good one.",

It could also summarize the state of Big Oil and the traditional energy sector in this post-covid, new ESG-focused era. \u201cPut simply, the Covid-19 pandemic has created the biggest shock to the global energy system since at least World War II,\u201d David Turk , then-Deputy Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA) told the Senate Energy and Commerce Committee on June 16, 2020. Turk is now Deputy Secretary of Energy. It also forced the much-needed transformation, according to Deloitte\u2019s head of the Energy, Resources and Industrials practice, Kathryn Pavlovsky. She told me on my Electric Ladies podcast recently that Covid provided a \u201cdry-run\u201d for Big Oil and the energy sector writ large for what we need to do to avert the irreversible, catastrophic potential impacts of climate change. \u201cIt's going to be that rate of decline that is needed to achieve some of the commitments that we're making across the globe\u2026by the timeline of 2050,\u201d adding that, \u201cit's really interesting to see what it required in the last 18 months to actually hit that and what it means going forward.\u201d GLASGOW, SCOTLAND - OCTOBER 13: Artists paint a mural on a a wall next to the Clydeside Expressway ...

As global leaders, including President Joe Biden, converge there in person for the first time in two years, the ESG era \u2013 for environment, social and governance \u2013 is now a C-level business, economic and geopolitical strategy, as well as an investment one.

Surround Yourself With Amazing Latina Women In past economic crises, talk of protecting the environment might have taken a back seat to getting the economy back on track. Not this time. \u201cWhat is intriguing,\u201d Pavlovsky said, \u201cis that the dialogue around environmental, social, governance, and climate did not slow in the (energy) sector in part, because I think it was obvious the evidence of what actually can be realized when we have, our activities reduced, whether it's on the commercial level, whether it's on the personal level.\u201d Here are six ways Pavlovsky said covid jolted Big Oil and the energy ecosystem into an ESG-focused \u201cnew normal\u201d: Kathryn Pavlovsky, head of Deloitte's Energy, Resources & Industrials practice Deloitte \u00b7 Changed demands for energy : When millions of people are continuing to work remotely, or coming to the office part-time, Pavlovsky asks, \u201cAre you just displacing the consumption, or are you actually reducing it?\u201d And, what does that mean, \u201crecognizing that the cost models that (they) operated on the past, aren't going to carry forward into the future?\u201d \u00b7 Big Oil goes \u201cnet zero\u201d: \u201c Many (energy) companies during the height of the pandemic were announcing their net zero goals,\u201d Pavlovsky pointed out, \u201cCertain of the super majors like BP and Shell actually hardened their goals and announced production cuts going forward over the next decade through automation and looking for opportunities to do this.\u201d BP said it will be net zero by 2050 \u201cor sooner,\u201d seeking to \u201cdecarbonize and diversify into different forms of energy, such as renewables, biofuels \u200eand hydrogen,\u201d while also keeping oil and gas in their mix. Participant seen holding a sign at the protest. Climate activists with Stop the Money Pipeline held ... [+] a rally (Photo by Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images) LightRocket via Getty Images \u00b7 Strong investor pressure: Climate-activist investors are making an impact . For example, Exxon-Mobil was forced by activist investors to swap out a couple of long-term board members for those more climate-focused. Since then, the company is reportedly considering announcing its own net zero goals. \u00b7 Increased transparency demands : The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory bodies are developing new reporting rules, based on demands from investors amid confusion due to the current array of voluntary reporting systems. Pavlovsky insists that, among Big Oil and the energy sector players overall, \u201cthere is a welcoming and a reception to receiving the additional guidance, to drive the consistency in the reporting\u2026to having a roadmap.\u201d She said these rules would enable more accurate comparisons between companies and industries. \u00b7 A transformed energy workplace : What does \u201creturn to work\u201d look like now in the energy sector? Pavlovsky highlighted that these massive changes converge with \u201csignificant advancement in both information technology, as well as operational technologies,\u2026 (for example) the pandemic was certainly an accelerator for digital.\u201d These both change the configuration of the energy sector workplace and could smooth the transition to this \u201cnew normal\u201d that demands less energy, less fossil fuel and dramatically fewer emissions. \u201cWe did see that the industry accelerated its energy transition.\u201d Woman in STEM Christina Morillo for pexels \u00b7 New needs and new skills create a more diverse workforce : One of the most intriguing things Pavlovsky said in our interview is that the rapid shift to new information, digital and operational technologies expedited by Covid-19 opens job and career opportunities for more diverse populations. \u201cIf you look at the challenges ahead of the industry and ESG and,\u201d she said, \u201cand what has been forced through the pandemic, it actually opens up, I think the option to really drive more diversity, and attract more women to the workforce.\u201d She added that, \u201cthe combination of the nature of the work and the reskilling, as well as the hybrid model and, and what they open up for women in terms of creating more flexibility.\u201d Now for the hard part though. The pandemic forced the energy sector to address all this low-hanging fruit in their business models and operations to reduce emissions and pivot to the new demands. \u201cWe're now getting to a place in the journey where it's getting harder,\u201d Pavlovsky says. But the energy sector can play a crucial role in ESG 2.0. \u201cThey also recognize they can be a really significant part of the solution\u2026..(and) can contribute. Whether it's our technological solutions, whether it's the talent that we bring to the market, we actually have a real role in shaping this across industries and sectors globally.\u201d Listen to Joan\u2019s full interview with Kathryn Pavlovsky on Electric Ladies podcast here .",

    "full_description": "A team of scientists has found a way to make use of an unusual material in next-generation batteries: Wood. The team from Brown University has developed a tree-derived material to be used in solid-state batteries, which are safer and less environmentally damaging than current batteries. Current generation lithium-ion batteries, like those used in phones, computers, and electronic vehicles, use volatile liquids as electrolytes. These electrolytes conduct lithium ions between the positive and negative electrodes of a battery. Liquid electrolytes do this job well, but they are toxic and can be dangerous. If the battery experiences a short circuit, for example, the liquid can combust and the battery can catch fire. This isn\u2019t usually a problem in everyday use, but it has led to the recall of some batteries which have been incorrectly manufactured. To make batteries safer, researchers are developing solid-state batteries, in which a solid material is used as an electrolyte instead. A solid, non-flammable material would be safer to use and potentially less environmentally damaging to produce. Most of the current research into solid electrolytes has involved ceramics , which conduct ions very well but which are brittle and can easily crack or break. The Brown team has developed a material to be used as a solid electrolyte which is composed of a combination of copper and polymer tubes that are derived from wood and are called cellulose nanofibrils. The polymer material the researchers developed is extremely thin and flexible, like a sheet of paper, which makes it easier to use in manufacturing. Yet its ion conductivity is as good as thicker, more brittle materials like ceramics. \u201cThe lithium ions move in this organic solid electrolyte via mechanisms that we typically found in inorganic ceramics, enabling the record high ion conductivity,\u201d said co-author Yue Qi, a professor at Brown\u2019s School of Engineering, in a statement . \u201cUsing materials nature provides will reduce the overall impact of battery manufacture to our environment.\u201d The researchers say they hope this development will help make solid-state batteries commonly available to improve safety in consumer electronics.

It was an obvious play for someone like me who used the iPad in a professional context before it was cool to do so. Apple\u2019s also given the iPad Pro cool new features exclusively over the past six years, leaving the regular iPad in the dust. But recently, Apple has started to show a willingness to share its best new features with the iPad, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Over the past several days I\u2019ve been rocking Apple\u2019s new 9th generation iPad and I\u2019m stunned to say, it\u2019s fantastic and it\u2019s the first one that has everything I need. The new iPad as I am going to call it throughout the rest of this post is on the surface, just another spec bump for the aging iPad home button design. But it\u2019s much more than that and features so many improvements across the board that it\u2019s the only iPad I\u2019d recommend to anyone right now. I love the iPad Pro, it\u2019s got a gorgeous ProMotion edge to edge display and an M1 chip inside. But I\u2019ve learned quickly that neither of those things are even remotely necessary for a great iPad experience. iPad Air packs similar performance to the new iPad but with an edge to edge Liquid Retina display. It\u2019s also compatible with Apple Pencil 2 and the Magic Keyboard but those are simply \u201cnice-to-haves.\u201d The new iPad mini isn\u2019t a product I\u2019d recommend to someone explicitly looking for an iPad, especially if the goal is to get work done. It\u2019s for a very niche audience of people who want a tiny computer that fits in a jacket pocket and feels like a 21st century moleskin journal. Black + silver = chef\u2019s kiss So with that out of the way, why do I love the new iPad? Let\u2019s start with the design. It looks mostly like every other iPad since the iPad Air 2 from 2014. But if you opt for the silver model, you get an all-new two tone look that Apple hasn\u2019t offered since the fourth generation iPad. It\u2019s got a black front bezel and a silver back chassis. It looks really nice and frankly it looks better than any iPad with a home button ever made. The space gray model looks exactly the same as any other space gray iPad so I\u2019d recommend staying away from it if you care about your device feeling and looking \u201cnew.\u201d A13 screams The new iPad has a really fast chip, in fact it\u2019s the first and only iPad to have an A13 Bionic processor. Apple only ever shipped the A13 in the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone SE, opting to give the iPad Pro an A12Z processor instead. I\u2019ve noticed instantly that the A13 makes the new iPad feel just as fast as an iPad Air or even an iPad mini. I know there are lots of nuances to consider, but in day-to-day standard use I don\u2019t feel any sort of difference. I don\u2019t play a lot of intense games on my iPads, instead I stick to simple games. I love puzzles and simulators and both categories play no differently here than they do on the more expensive iPads. I\u2019ve been playing a ton of Townscaper on my iPad and it runs spectacularly well. The neural engine in the A13 makes the new iPad scream, it\u2019s the best thing about this particular chip upgrade. It\u2019s blazing fast and makes multitasking feel as fluid as it does on iPad Air. It\u2019s a great experience and anyone, even the most intense iPad users would be happy with it. I had previously spent some time with the 7th generation iPad and I consistently found it dropping frames and slowing down in places other iPads wouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s no longer an issue with the $329 iPad. If you have last year\u2019s 8th generation iPad with the A12 chip you\u2019re still in good shape. But the evolution from A12 to A13 was huge and you can feel the improvements in performance across the board. This was especially the case when Apple introduced the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro. Center stage If you want an iPad for video calls, don\u2019t buy an iPad Air. Buy the new iPad. It\u2019s got one of Apple\u2019s best new features: Center Stage. Center stage uses a new wide angle front facing camera and adjusts the field of view to properly show you and anyone else on your end of the call. The camera is also significantly better, being now 12 megapixels rather than a 1.2 megapixel camera. It\u2019s one of the best front facing cameras Apple has ever shipped in a product. A much improved display The display on the new iPad continues to be 10.2-inches on the diagonal. It\u2019s a great size and is just enough screen to get work done efficiently without feeling cramped. It\u2019s also not that much smaller than the 10.9-inch and 11-inch iPad Air and iPad Pro respectively. Apple hasn\u2019t changed the display resolution at all but has introduced one of its best display features: True Tone. With True Tone on the new iPad, the display adjusts its color temperature based on ambient lighting. When you\u2019re in a warmer space, the display turns more yellow. When you\u2019re in a bright white space, the display turns more blue. Apple\u2019s tech here is miraculous and anyone who has used True Tone knows its something you can\u2019t live without once you\u2019ve used it. Apple has also added sRGB color to the new iPad, improving color reproduction. But it\u2019s not such a big improvement year over year that you\u2019ll notice. Way more storage, same great price One of the best aspects of the new iPad is storage configurations. Apple has doubled the storage configurations on the new iPad but kept the price points the same. The new iPad starts with 64GB of storage at the same $329 price. That base model is a great value, but the new 256GB option is an incredible value. Apple previously only offered 128GB maximum on the iPad, but 256GB is computer level good. For $479, you can get a 256GB iPad with Wi-Fi. The iPad mini starts at $499 with 64GB of storage and the iPad Air starts at the same 64GB for $599. So you can get 256GB of storage for less than the price of the base iPad mini or iPad Air. There are cellular options available, but I\u2019d stay away from those for now. The cellular iPads only have LTE, while the iPad mini and iPad Pro both have 5G. if you\u2019ve got a phone with LTE, just use the hotspot. If you\u2019ve got a phone with 5G, you\u2019re in an even better position. Apple will eventually bring 5G to the base iPad. It\u2019s unclear if the technology will be affordable enough to put in the 10th generation iPad next year, but it\u2019ll get here eventually. Apple\u2019s put lots of eggs in the 5G basket. iPadOS 15 feels the same Using this new iPad feels virtually identical to using an iPad Air or iPad Pro. It\u2019s running the same iPadOS 15 with improvements to multitasking, quick note, and widgets on the Home Screen. You can do just about anything you can do on the iPad Pro with this new iPad. Multitasking feels great on the new iPad. Moving apps into split view is fluid. Slide over is quick and apps are pretty good at staying in the state I left them. The app switcher isn\u2019t wonky at all and I haven\u2019t noticed any dropped frames. Long story short, the new iPad works perfectly for multitasking. What else is new There are a handful of other changes in this new iPad. First off, Apple has actually removed one thing: GSM and Edge. Cellular models won\u2019t be able to connect to networks that use those protocols. It\u2019s not a big deal for most people since neither are really used anymore, but if you live in a country or area that does use them it\u2019s important to know. Apple has added a new feature to the video camera on the new iPad. Users can now film at 25fps if they want to in addition to 30fps. The Wi-Fi model of the new iPad actually weighs slightly less than last year\u2019s 8th generation iPad. It\u2019s a very marginal difference and you probably won\u2019t notice it. But it\u2019s a nice little component of the new iPad\u2019s story. Ironically, the cellular models of the new iPad are heavier this year than they were last year. What\u2019s the same There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s still the same in the new iPad. The most obvious thing that\u2019s still the same is the Touch ID sensor built-in to the home button on the front. It\u2019s as fast and secure as ever and I love it. Using the the new iPad has confirmed my suspicion that the home button Touch ID sensor is more accurate and reliable than the side mounted one on iPad Air and iPad mini. Apple has kept the lightning connector on the new iPad. They say it\u2019s to maintain compatibility with accessories that organizations use with existing iPads, but I think it\u2019s more than that. I\u2019ve noticed that carrying the new iPad and an iPhone and having one lightning charger is infinitely better than having to lug a lightning charger and a USB-C charger everywhere I go. An average iPad user doesn\u2019t need USB-C and they\u2019ll more than likely be happy that they can use the same charger as their iPhone. Lightning also means you still can use the original Apple Pencil. Apple\u2019s second generation pencil is better, but not so much better that this is a miss. The only real benefit of the second generation Apple Pencil is that it sticks to the side. The speakers on the new iPad are still stereo and mounted on the bottom. These are the worst speakers you can get in an iPad right now, but they\u2019re still really good. They\u2019re not as loud or as full as the iPad Air or iPad Pro, but you\u2019ll be happy with them. The rear facing camera is still 8 megapixels and fairly mediocre. It\u2019s fine for shooting a quick video or snapping a photo on the fly, but you do not want to use this as your primary camera. I don\u2019t know why anyone would want to use an iPad as their primary camera, but if you plan to do so get an iPad Pro. The new iPad still uses the original smart connector design, meaning you can still use the Smart Keyboard. It\u2019s still floppy and goofy looking when closed but it continues to be a great on-the-go keyboard. I particularly love using it in coffee shops. And unlike the Smart Keyboard Folio and Magic Keyboards for the iPad Air and iPad Pro, you can adjust the Smart Keyboard to work as a standard Smart Cover stand for watching movies. You can nicely tuck the keyboard behind the iPad. I thought that I\u2019d miss the trackpad on the Magic Keyboard, but I don\u2019t. We went a decade without a trackpad on iPad and I\u2019m still perfectly comfortable using one without it. Lastly, yes there is a headphone jack. I will never use it, but it\u2019s there and it\u2019s good that people who want an iPad with a headphone jack can still buy one. Verdict This is the iPad to get. Unless you absolutely want USB-C or to use Apple\u2019s newer Apple Pencil and keyboards, there\u2019s no reason to spend the huge premium to upgrade to a higher end iPad. Apple has turned the base $329 iPad into something that works for everyone. The changes they\u2019ve made are in all the right places this year. It\u2019s way faster, it\u2019s better for working remotely, it\u2019s got a better display for entertainment, and yet it\u2019s still as thin and light as ever. It\u2019s hard to beat the value that Apple has here. It\u2019s the best tablet for most people. PS: If you\u2019re a student you can can get the new iPad for just $309 and if you\u2019re buying the new iPad in bulk for schools and universities you can get them for just $299.

    "full_description": "Shiba Inu soared to record highs over the weekend to become the 11th-biggest cryptocurrency by market value. SHIB, as it\u2019s known, was up 50% in the 24 hours through 10:10 a.m. New York time on Sunday, according to pricing from CoinGecko.com, and reached a record earlier in the day. A petition on Change.org imploring Robinhood to list SHIB on its platform has garnered almost 300,000 signatures. The token has gained more than 40 million percent in the past year. \u201cMemes have value and have been an investible thesis in 2021,\u201d Jonathan Cheesman, head of over-the-counter and institutional sales at crypto-derivatives exchange FTX, said in an email Sunday. \u201cLower dollar-price tokens are attractive to retail\u201d because investors can still buy more than 20,000 SHIB for $1, he said. The SHIB ecosystem has also dropped a number of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, and a page for them says they\u2019re currently sold out, though it promises other packs are coming soon. \u201cWith such memecoins it\u2019s hard to speculate on the actual reasons for price movements, in all honesty,\u201d Vijay Ayyar, head of Asia-Pacific with crypto exchange Luno Pte., said in a message Sunday. But \u201cthere are some interesting communities being built around them.\u201d History shows caution may be warranted. \u201cAt this moment attention seems to have converged on SHIB\u201d and speculation is the primary driver of the price surge, Ben Caselin, head of research and strategy at crypto exchange AAX, said in a message Sunday. Prior patterns and dynamics in crypto indicate that SHIB is \u201clikely to be challenged by other projects and shed much of its value\u201d further along in the market cycle, he added. Shiba Inu was founded in 2020 by an anonymous person going by the name Ryoshi, and the coin\u2019s website refers to it as \u201ca decentralized meme token that evolved into a vibrant ecosystem.\u201d It appears to have been made in the vein of Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that was created as a joke in 2013, and also has a Shiba Inu theme, fashioned after the Japanese dog breed. Dogecoin has since become a popular token that\u2019s used for payments by some sports teams, AMC theaters and others. Dogecoin has also gained in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. Its market value is about $34 billion, while Shiba Inu\u2019s is around $21 billion. Both can be quite volatile. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right -- there are two doggy meme coins in the top 10\u201d cryptos, excluding stablecoins, Cheesman said. \u201cDon\u2019t short things Millennials think are funny.\u201d",

    "full_description": "Asus has made brightness a top priority for 2021: Many of its laptop series will now be equipped with an OLED display by default. This brings the OLED technology and 3K/4K resolution into the lower price ranges. Mid-range customers will start to seriously consider buying OLED panels now that the difference to devices without OLED is no longer 500 Euros (~$581) but only 200 to 300 Euros (~$232 to ~$349). That said, Asus doesn't offer mid-range hardware and workmanship with the Zenbook 14X. The chassis has above-average sturdiness and quality. The input devices including the ScreenPad (ClickPad = 2nd display) are first class, and the performance with the Core i7 and the GeForce MX450 is almost top of the line in the subnotebook league. However, the competition doesn't sleep either and offers a powerful rival in the form of the Dell XPS 13 9310 OLED , for example. Is the only difference the absence of a dGPU? Do we have nothing but praise for the Zenbook 14X, or are there a few points of criticism? Find out in our review. The case alone is already rather impressive. Asus hasn't gone for the lightest possible case, but in return, it achieves an exceptionally torsion-resistant chassis. The lid can't be pressed in when applying normal force! That is extremely rare - even in the highest-quality subnotebooks. The aluminum back of the lid forms a seemingly indestructible unit with the integrated display panel (non-touch). The rigorous quality extends to the hinges: The closed position is held magnetically to the base, and the lid can then be opened with one finger. After this, the hinges provide such a firm grip that everything stays in place when carrying or lifting the device. The base, which is completely made of aluminum, is no different. It can only be pressed in a bit from underneath at certain points. The keyboard doesn't flex at any point, and the base itself is completely firm. With its 1.4 kg, the Zenbook is among the heavier models. Only the HP Envy 14-eb0010nr exceeds it with 1.6 kg. The difference to the average of the lighter 14-inch and 13-inch devices is 100 grams. However, you receive a sturdier chassis in return. The thinnest model in our comparison is the Dell XPS 13 9310 OLED with 14.8 mm and only 1.2 kg. Asus provides two Type-C Thunderbolt 4 ports. They can output an image signal (DisplayPort) as well be used to connect the power adapter (100 watts). Including HDMI, three displays can be connected. In practice, however, it will be limited to two if the Type-C charger is used at the same time. Like its counterparts, the micro SD reader performs averagely, but not very well. We tested it with the 128 GB AV PRO V60 microSD. The Intel AX201 Wi-Fi chip is integrated into the device, so it can't be replaced. In our test, the transfer rates are repeatedly clearly below average, so they don't represent what an AX201 is usually capable of. We attribute this to a suboptimal driver configuration in our pre-production sample and expect better results in production models. The webcam in our review sample was unresponsive, and the electronic shutter (orange shutter in front of the camera) didn't respond to the corresponding Fn keys. We presume that this is a pre-production error. Opening the Zenbook is complicated because of the screws that hide under the rubber feet. Afterwards, the lid can be lifted off easily. However, there's not much to maintain here, since both the Wi-Fi module and RAM are soldered (no socket). The power button has a fingerprint sensor that is very inconspicuous: You can log in quickly with the physical sensor, and no space is wasted for a separate fingerprint module. The TPM (Trusted Platform Module) firmware on the motherboard has been standard for a while and is a basic requirement for Windows 11. In some ways, this crypto processor behaves like a permanently installed smart card, but it's tied to the local computer instead of a user. The Zenbook 14X is not available in stores in Germany yet. Asus normally offers a two-year Pickup and Return warranty in Germany. The matte, non-slip keys have a pronounced pressure point, a moderate travel, and a firm stroke. Typing is almost silent. Working in darker environments is possible thanks to the three-stage white backlight. Overall, the wide keyboard with its large Shift, Ctrl and directional keys allows the user to type quickly. The spacing between the keys is quite large by laptop standards (2.5 mm). The keyboard's firm base is a very positive aspect. Nothing flexes here at any point. The ClickPad is sensitive up to the edges and offers a short travel. It operates with a dull, quiet noise. The matte surface is quite smooth, but not slippery. It provides a comfortable surface for fingers to glide on. We find the short stroke unsatisfactory, but that's a matter of personal taste. The pad can turn into a display when desired: The pad function can be used on the fly with an overlay or for longer periods of time by deactivating the display function (Fn+F6). The ScreenPad 2.0 is matte and has a resolution of Full HD+ (2160x1080). This is an IPS panel. In Windows, the secondary display operates as an extended desktop like any HDMI-connected monitor would. You can drag windows into it such as the Steam app, an editor, or the tools from Photoshop, for example. Digital signatures take place on the ScreenPad, since the OLED panel is non-touch after all. Asus has preloaded groups on the ScreenPad. Each group can be populated with applications that are useful on the small display: Handwriting, number pad, app store, calculator, or Spotify, for instance. The main argument for buying the Zenbook 14X is its 14-inch OLED panel. Samsung provides a WQXGA+ panel with 2880x1800 pixels (16:10). With a refresh rate of 90 Hz and a response time of 0.2 milliseconds, the vibrant display outshines any IPS model. It also promises 100% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, and we can confirm this with our measurements. Asus states that the brightness reaches 500 nits; we measured 381 cd/m\u00b2 on average and a maximum of 401 cd/m\u00b2. Nits and cd/m\u00b2 are converted 1:1, which means that we weren't able to measure the brightness advertised by the manufacturer. Brightness is distributed homogeneously. High brightness levels are harmful for OLED displays anyway, so they shouldn't be used on a permanent basis. Regarding the issue of burn-in, Asus responds with an OLED screensaver that can't be disabled. It activates after 15 minutes and is important for protecting the panel. According to the manufacturer, users can disable the screensaver after having been informed of the associated risks (warning message). This should be possible via the personal MyAsus Settings (account required). We didn't find an option to turn off the screen saver in the Windows 10 display settings. The screen-to-body ratio is 92\uff05, which is a very narrow bezel around a lot of display. The Samsung panel makes use of DC dimming to reduce brightness. Asus has three panel options in its lineup for the Zenbook 14X: the WQXGA+ (2880x1800) non-touch version as in our review unit, the same panel but with touch functionality, and a 4K touch (3840x2400) option. Specifications such as HDR True Black 600, 100% DCI-P3, and a screen-to-body ratio of 92\uff05 are identical in all variants. As one would expect, the OLED display features an outstanding contrast (3,790:1); blacks are deep, and colors are vibrant. As typical for OLEDs, the response times are also excellent. PWM for brightness reduction sets in at brightness levels of 50% and below, making the display flicker at a frequency of 362 Hz. Sensitive users might be affected by this, although we rarely adjusted brightness below 50% in practice. In normal office usage in daylight, we operated at 60-70%. We measured the grayscale and color DeltaE values before calibration at 2.4 and 2.3, respectively - very good values as they are below 3.0. Calibration improved grayscales a bit (1.8), but colors became worse (2.4). In short: You can skip calibration, because the factory-calibrated panel can't be improved. The glossy surface (non-touch) suffers from reflections outdoors, and the high brightness doesn't help much here. The panel can be used well in shaded areas, partly also because the brightness doesn't decrease on battery power (379 cd/m\u00b2 at the center of the display). There's no question that OLED panels provide the best viewing angles available. Even from flat angles, colors remain stable, and brightness doesn't lose intensity. Asus has opted for the Tiger Lake 28-watt Intel Core i7-1165G7 (2.8 GHz) with an integrated Intel Iris Xe G7 graphics card (Gen 12). The latter is complemented by the Nvidia Intel Core i7-1165G7 , which can be disabled (Optimus). There will be a variant with the i5-1135G7 (2.4 GHz) for price-conscious buyers, which will also be combined with the MX450 . The target group consists of professional users who are looking for a respectable, portable laptop with a high-end display and all-round performance for both work and play. The Core i7-1165G7 (2.8 GHz) has a PL1 of 50 watts and a PL2 (short term) of 61 watts. In practice, the processor only operates with 61 watts for seconds, the PL2 value briefly touches the 60-watt mark when Cinebench R15 is run once (100% CPU load). The PL1 value is maintained at 50 watts for a short time only as well, dropping to 28 watts within five seconds. The CPU package consumes an average of 35 watts, with a peak of up to 45 watts at the beginning. This changes on battery power, where the PL1/PL2 values aren't used at all; the CPU package power consumption briefly scratches the 20-watt mark and then runs at a constant 7 watts. The result: Instead of 951 points, only 284 points (30%) are achieved in the R15 test. The loop shows that the Zenbook 14X's Turbo stability is suboptimal, which is largely congruent with the other i7-1165G7 devices. As we have often seen, the Ryzen 7 5700U plays in a completely different league in this respect, but its Turbo also weakens after the first run. In all Cinebench tests, the i7-1165G7 lags behind the Ryzen 7 5700U in multi-core scenarios by a significant margin (-24%). The situation is the other way around in single-core mode, with the i7 leading by a wide margin (+17%). All in all, the SoC's performance is slightly above average compared to other models with the same chipset. According to PCMark 10, the Zenbook 14X is at the forefront in terms of application performance, especially when it comes to productivity. The benchmark takes advantage of the super fast SK Hynix SSD here. In our standardized latency test (web browsing, YouTube 4K playback, CPU load), the Zenbook shows problems with elevated latencies. This is due to Kernel Mode drivers. The existing driver configuration is not suitable for real-time audio applications. There were 56 dropped frames during video playback. The 1 TB SK Hynix doesn't disappoint, since it outperforms nearly all contenders in our comparison. Only the Samsung PM981a in the Zenbook 14 UX435EG is about 25% faster. In practice, the differences aren't perceptible anyway; you can only identify them through measurements. Approximately 870 GB is available out of the box. The MX450 installed (Turing TU117M) is the second most powerful variant, the N18S-G5, which offers a 64-bit connection and 1,395 to 1,575 MHz along with GDDR6. It operates with up to 25 watts. Nevertheless, the manufacturer refrains from using a second fan. Besides the GeForce MX450 GPU, you also get the integrated Intel Iris Xe 96EUs graphics. The MX450 is at the top in the synthetic benchmarks, and it's on par with the Iris Xe Graphics G7 96EUs or outperforms it by almost 10% in some cases. The MX450 beats the Vega 8 (ZenBook 13 OLED UM325UA) by about 40-50%. In the real gaming benchmarks, the MX450 performs moderately. In The Witcher 3 Ultra, the dGPU performs below average: The MSI Modern 14 B11SB-085 and the HP Envy 13-ba1475ng equipped with the same dGPU are about 20% ahead, and even an Iris Xe Graphics G7 96EUs is a tad faster at times ( Dell XPS 13 9310 OLED ). The MX450 runs better in Far Cry 5 , Strange Brigade , and New World , and it even outperforms an Iris Xe Graphics G7 96EUs by 50% ( Strange Brigade ). We lack comparison rates in Far Cry 5 , but the MX450 performs better than its own average here. The recent New World is still just playable at 32 FPS at Full HD resolution and medium details, but you can't switch to 3K. We looked at The Witcher 3 in the Ultra setting (Full HD). The FPS keep jumping from 18 to 26 FPS in equal intervals, staying at each level for almost 2 minutes. The video clock rate and temperature increase synchronously following the same cycle. The temperature management apparently allows the dGPU to jump from 1,300 to 1,575 MHz when the temperature drops below 65 \u00b0C (~149 \u00b0F) for a certain amount of time. The rapid increase in GPU temperatures in turn causes the clock rates to drop in two stages (1,450, 1,250 MHz). Thermals don't seem to work optimally with the single fan and the heat pipes that aren't separated, because we rarely observe such an abrupt increase and decrease of clock speeds. This seems to be an isolated case, since the thermals and video clock rates don't show any abnormal changes in New World (Medium, Full HD). See Logviewer. The fan noise is quite good: You don't notice anything in idle usage, but the fan is still partly active, although you can only hear it if you place you ear close to the device. We measured 38 and 37 dB(A) under load, very low rates for a laptop with a dGPU. Load Medium refers to The Witcher 3 running at Full HD and Ultra settings. We can see that the thermal performance of the dGPU reaches its limits, which not only leads to fluctuations in GPU clock rates, but also to varying fan speeds. The 37 dB(A) is the maximum here. In the stress test with Prime95 and FurMark, 38 dB(A) is reached. The fan noise is harmless; the fan speeds up imperceptibly and then gently decreases again. In the office scenario, we had a device on the table that was lukewarm at most at all times. The air outlet is on the left side, and the intake is between the hinges. Our stress test with Prime95 and FurMark examines how the system handles maximum load over time. The surface temperatures still rise here (48 \u00b0C (~118 \u00b0F) at the top), and the core temperatures settle at 65 \u00b0C (~149 \u00b0F) after a peak of 90 \u00b0C (~194 \u00b0F). In this case, the package power is only 12 watts after seven minutes, 5 watts could only be maintained for a few seconds. There is no performance drop immediately after the stress test. We performed the same analysis using only Prime95 and noticed that the Zenbook didn't struggle nearly as much. A package power of just under 27 \u00b0C (~81 \u00b0F) is held constant (also PL1). During this test, 90 \u00b0C (~194 \u00b0F) was never reached, and the SoC fluctuated around 78 \u00b0C (~172 \u00b0F). Speakers like these are rare! The Zenbook delivers volume, a certain amount of depth and bass, and reproduces highs in a balanced way. The small speakers are located on the right and left sides under the palm rest, using the surface as a reflector. In this respect, sound is better when the device is placed on a hard table than on a soft carpet. The dual-array microphone picks up voices without noise, which is ideal for video calls and conferences. This must be due to the OLED technology. The idle power consumption is 7.2 watts, which is 40-50% more than the competition with IPS displays at the same size. The Dell XPS 13 9310 OLED has this small problem as well. This persists when it comes to the average idle consumption (10.4 watts) and the maximum idle consumption (11 watts), although the latter doesn't seem to be all that high compared to the competition. Unfortunate for the carbon footprint: The OLED screensaver, which can't be disabled under normal circumstances, results in an unnecessarily high power consumption of 9-12 watts in idle usage, and this using a brightness of 150 cd/m\u00b3 (-3 levels) and no keyboard backlighting! The Witcher 3 Ultra represents the maximum gaming load for the MX450 , which we measure at 53 watts. This is an average; due to the GPU clock speeds throttling, power consumption fluctuates between 45 watts and 73 watts here. The 100-watt power adapter really has to work hard under maximum load in the stress test; it has to supply 96 watts at the beginning. As the stress test shows, power consumption is significantly lower in this case as well due to throttling, namely 60 watts after about two minutes. The Zenbook 14X's battery life is modest. The Wi-Fi test only lasts 5:21 hours, even though we manually disabled the screensaver. If the screensaver is used in the browser test, the runtime is much lower at 2:22 hours. The Zenbook has to make do with 63 Wh, but this is the usual configuration, even among the competition. With the Zenbook 14X, Asus has a subnotebook in its lineup that is - for the most part - a joy to use. For starters, there's the vivid and bright OLED panel with a 3K resolution that reproduces the common color spaces with ease and accuracy. But the Zenbook is also in the lead in terms of workmanship, input devices, and ports with 2x Thunderbolt 4 connections and ScreenPad 2.0. It's just a pleasure to use the Zenbook 14X, since it's a solid and very well-built subnotebook. While we can fully praise it in most disciplines, battery life, power consumption, and performance development deserve some criticism. A battery runtime of just over 5 hours is below average for a modern high-end subnotebook. The compulsory OLED screensaver leads to a high power consumption of 9-12 watts in idle use. The single fan is required to cool the MX450 and the Intel i7 at the same time, which makes graphics performance fluctuate in some games and doesn't allow the processor to be in top form under sustained load. We are eager to see whether the production model will perform better here. At the time of writing, the Asus Zenbook 14X UX5400E doesn't seem to be available in the United States yet. We reviewed a pre-production unit with an English keyboard. Therefore, it's difficult to make price comparisons with the competition. Users who can do without the performance of a dGPU but want an OLED display should take a closer look at the Dell XPS 13 9310 OLED . Battery life and PWM were points of criticism there. Next, there's the Asus ZenBook 13 OLED UM325UA, which we haven't reviewed yet. Technically, it promises to be a very interesting and comparatively affordable device with its Ryzen 5000 and a Full HD OLED display (approx. 1,500 Euros (~$1,746)). If OLED technology isn't that important, high-performance 14-inchers like the Asus Zenbook 14 UX435EG ( MX450 ) or the HP Envy 14-eb0010nr (GTX 1650 Ti Max-Q) are worth considering, with the Envy 14 having the better IPS display. However, prospective buyers should take a close look at these models because there are other reasons apart from the OLED technology which cause their rating to be 5-6% lower than that of the Asus Zenbook 14X UX5400E under review.",

    "full_description": "Chlo\u00e9 Zhao\u2019s 2020 film Nomadland begins with a few sparse lines of text that set up an entire world of loss. A sheetrock plant in the real-life town of Empire, Nevada, shuts down in January 2011. In six months\u2019 time, Empire\u2019s zip code is discontinued. It\u2019s a ghost town. A stable-seeming environment is revealed to be constantly in flux, sometimes with frightening and destabilizing speed. Eternals , Zhao\u2019s follow-up to her acclaimed Academy Award-winning film, also begins with explanatory text. This time however, it\u2019s more lore than story, about beings from another planet brought to ours for a purpose the audience won\u2019t fully grasp until the end of the film. It is withholding and not inviting, as if, from the very start, there are two forces at war for the kind of film Eternals should be. The latest film from Marvel Studios is equal parts puzzle piece and experiment. Eternals expands the frontiers of the MCU providing hints about what its future may hold while also being a project of formal ambition. Zhao deliberately breaks from the well-established Marvel formula to tell a more sweeping and mature story \u2014 the sort of story the filmmaker is known for. The script takes the sort of seismic shifts that can happen around us in six brief months and blows them up on a geologic scale across thousands of years, through the eyes of the most consciously diverse cast in a superhero blockbuster. Eternals , however, is ultimately haunted by that formula, continually yielding to the familiar whenever it tries to show us something new. Eternals is also saddled with one of the densest premises in Marvel Comics history, a relative anomaly in the large stable of memorable characters created by comics legend Jack Kirby. Even the considerably streamlined film version can\u2019t lay the groundwork without heaps of exposition: The Eternals, the film\u2019s opening text describes, are superhuman champions from a world called Olympia, dispatched to Earth by a cosmic god named Arimesh, a Celestial, in order to defend humankind from the monstrous Deviants. Throughout history, the Eternals have been here, helping humanity by fighting off Deviants and slowly providing technological advancement \u2014 to a certain point. Because the Eternals have another mandate: They cannot interfere in Earthly conflicts that don\u2019t involve the Deviants. This is the reason the film gives \u2014 in an actual conversation, between characters \u2014 for The Eternals taking a raincheck on Thanos\u2019 genocidal rampage or any of the horrors and atrocities of the past. It\u2019s a bit hard to swallow, especially when the film goes to great special-effects lengths to depict historical moments of mass destruction. To the film\u2019s credit, part of Eternals narrative arc is its characters wrestling with the morality of this mandate. The misfortune of putting this dilemma to characters who live for thousands of years is pretty simple: The longer the characters take to let awful stuff happen before they do something about it, the more they seem like chumps. In the present day, however, it\u2019s pretty easy for the Eternals to follow this mandate. All of the Deviants on Earth have been wiped out, but instead of being offered a ticket to their home, Olympia, they\u2019ve been effectively abandoned by their god and gone their separate ways, living in secret among the people of Earth. The exposition pauses and the action begins when Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Sprite (Lia McHugh), who live in London as a teacher and an (eternal) 12-year-old, respectively, are attacked by a not-so-extinct Deviant who also seems strong enough to kill Eternals. When the Superman-esque Ikaris (Richard Madden) arrives to help fend the Deviant off, a mini Eternals reunion becomes a full-blown road trip to get the family back together and figure out what\u2019s going on with the Deviants. From here, Eternals becomes a hybrid travelogue and historical epic. As Sersi, Ikkaris, and Sprite reunite with their seven other \u201csiblings\u201d across the globe, the film flashes back to pivotal moments of their time on Earth, reflecting on their relationships with each other and humanity. They\u2019re in Mesopotamia in 5000 B.C. kickstarting the Bronze Age; then they\u2019re in Babylon in 575 B.C. seeding the wonders of the Hanging Gardens; then they\u2019re in 1575 Mexico waching in shock as genocide Spanish colonists murder the people of Tenochtitlan. In cross cutting from one era to another, Zhao begins to emphasize place more than anything else \u2014 even action scenes seem to fade to take a backseat, a momentary interruption to the interpersonal drama of the Eternals as they question their role in the places around them. They fall in and out of love with each other, and humanity. They meet and are rebuffed by their god, Arishem the Celestial. They spend most of the film in doubt, unsure of what to do or believe. But Eternals is contemplative to a fault. Every time a new character is introduced, the ones we\u2019ve previously met re-explain the story, and the same agreements and disagreements play out. In the best moments, Zhao allows the film to breathe around its most well-realized characters, like Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) who has settled into life as a Bollywood star and joins up because he wants to turn the adventure into a documentary about him saving the world with his ridiculously powerful finger guns. Less bombastic but equally compelling is Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), the Eternal inventor who, out of guilt for accelerating human technology to atomic war is possible, has retreated into a quiet domestic life with his human husband and son in the suburbs. The film\u2019s cast is too big to give every character a fulfilling arc, but the film\u2019s script by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo devotes most of the film\u2019s runtime to its least compelling characters. Sersi, with her vague power to transmute inanimate matter from one form to another, most effectively shown off when she turns a speeding bus into rose petals, is the de facto protagonist, but also a listless one: She is torn between her life pretending to be mortal and dating her historian boyfriend Dane (Kit Harington) and her grander purpose, which she starts to question, but only when forced to. It\u2019s almost like the Eternals take their vow of nonintervention so seriously that they also refuse to drive the film\u2019s plot. Much has been made about what Chlo\u00e9 Zhao brings to the MCU as a filmmaker, largely stemming from Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige gushing over her insistence that Eternals be filmed on real locations , and not largely on green-screened soundstages, as many Marvel films are. The result is distinctive, but also strangely hollow. It\u2019s as if, in order to accomodate the needs of a Marvel blockbuster, Eternals could only stage its action in the most barren of natural environments: A beach, a forest, a desert. Places big and open enough that a soundstage could be approximated, however begrudgingly. When it\u2019s time for the naturalism of the film to give way to artificial action, the result is surprisingly demure \u2014 with one spectacular exception at the very end, Eternals\u2019 action is quite small; a strange contrast to its grand scope. When the heroes \u201csuit up\u201d for their final fight, it almost feels wrong, or reluctant. The pat descriptors Marvel executives like Kevin Feige append to MCU films don\u2019t hang so neatly on Eternals . Genre shorthand does a poor job of conveying what a viewer should expect. There are no heists, no spycraft, no strange new worlds nor hidden fantasy realms. Eternals is a meandering film about being estranged from your family, and how difficult it is to get the stones up to finally see them again. It\u2019s two and a half hours full of people many thousands of years old going from place to place and talking about the good old days. After over a decade of the MCU formula\u2019s dominance, it\u2019s easy to mistake Eternals \u2019 deviance for profundity. Films that wrestle with difficult experiences can often be difficult to watch, and intentionally so. Unfortunately, Eternals isn\u2019t bold, merely incongruous. The simpler explanation is truer: Eternals is a mess. It\u2019s a movie concerned with conveying scale, about big ideas and forces that move on a geologic timetable beyond any one life. It wrestles with a morality that stretches beyond the considerations of one person or one planet, with purpose when time and distance have next to no meaning. The Marvel output bucks and protests under these conditions. The company\u2019s plot-driven blockbusters are overwhelmingly concerned with the present, and to an arguably greater extent, what\u2019s next. Eternals considers where we are, where we\u2019ve been, and how much it\u2019s changed us, if at all. These are largely internal ideas that are not easily translated to superhuman brawls in dim environs, where the beauty of the natural world is just a blank canvas for lasers and punching. Every fight is like a tether pulling Eternals back to the ground when it would rather fly. Each scene expounding on the cosmology of the MCU does more for movies we haven\u2019t seen yet than it does for the one we\u2019re watching. Movies can be big enough for ideas like this: difficult conversations of cosmic import with no clear answer, angry confrontations with an uncaring god, and whether or not our moral compass should shift as our perspective and reach grows. But a film must create a world where those questions matter, to its characters and to its audience. In a few short lines, Zhao did that with Nomadland . Eternals , however, just isn\u2019t big enough. Or perhaps the Marvel Cinematic Universe is just too small. Eternals premieres in theaters on Friday, Nov. 5.",

    "full_description": "Ray tracing is one of the most exciting new capabilities of the Xbox Series X . Brought to market by Nvidia\u2019s RTX range of graphics cards , ray tracing adds a new level of depth and realism to games. Instead of using predetermined lighting points or shadow maps, ray tracing follows each simulated photon of light, rendering reflections, shadows, and lighting overall in a more true-to-life way. The problem is that ray tracing is extremely demanding, so not every game supports it. Worse, some games that originally advertised ray tracing don\u2019t support it now. We did the digging so you don\u2019t have to, compiling a list of every Xbox Series X game that supports ray tracing. Because of the mix-ups in marketing, our list is focused on released games only. It should grow significantly as the console generation matures. Further reading The best Xbox Series X games Xbox Series X tips and tricks The history of Xbox Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War features ray-traced shadows on Xbox Series X. Although reflections are easier to spot, ray traced shadows do a lot to bring a scene to life over traditional rasterized shadows. Black Ops Cold War continues the story of the original Black Ops game. You play as a highly specialized operative sent on a black operation to neutralize a Soviet spy at the behest of Ronald Reagan. Call of the Sea One of the most overlooked games of 2020, Call of the Sea is a delightful, surprising adventure/puzzle about exploring an island. We\u2019ll leave the narrative description at that ( Call of the Sea really has an excellent story, and we\u2019d hate to spoil it). The Xbox console exclusive supports ray tracing on Series X consoles, making the gorgeous, pseudo-realistic island look even prettier. Control Ultimate Edition Control Ultimate Edition , which includes the next-gen version of Control along with all of the DLC, supports ray-traced shadows and reflections on Xbox Series X. The game has two graphical modes, one without ray tracing that runs at 60 fps (frames per second), and another with ray tracing that runs at 30 fps. Control comes from Remedy Entertainment ( Alan Wake, Quantum Break ), and like the studio\u2019s previous games, it\u2019s a high-octane action game with an engaging, if unsettling, narrative. Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition Originally, Capcom announced that Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition would not feature ray tracing at launch on Xbox Series X, but the game launched with the same suite of graphical options across Series X and PlayStation 5 . It actually features four graphics modes, two of which enable ray-traced reflections. Quality mode renders the game at 4K and runs between 30 fps and 60 fps , while performance mode renders the game at 1080p and stays locked at 60 fps. Doom Eternal After an optimization patch, Doom Eternal can now show you all the demonic blood and gore the way it was always meant to be seen. The update gives players three choices for how they want the game to run on their Series X: Performance, Balanced, and Quality. Quality is the only one with ray tracing, however. Unlike many other games, though, it manages to hold a rock-solid 60 fps at a crisp 1080p resolution while still showing off all the lighting effects for an even more immersive and brutal experience. Enlisted Enlisted is part of Xbox\u2019s Game Preview program, meaning it\u2019s still in active development. It\u2019s a squad-based FPS/MMO set during World War 2, allowing you to play in the battles that defined the war. Enlisted is a game all about scale, and ray tracing helps with that a lot. Developer Darkflow Software actually uses a proprietary system for ray-traced global illumination, allowing the studio to achieve accurate lighting and shadows in even the largest scenes. Fortnite Fortnite has ray tracing on PC, but information about the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions is sparse. The visual upgrade between current- and last-gen is clear, though. On Series X, Fortnite\u2019 s lighting is softer and more accurate, with the iconic ray tracing shine that comes from any object emitting light. Fortnite isn\u2019t the best showcase of ray tracing, but if you play a lot, the graphical enhancements are enough to justify the jump to the Series X. Gears 5 Gears 5 doesn\u2019t actually use the ray-tracing hardware inside the Xbox Series X, instead using software ray tracing in screen-space. That doesn\u2019t mean ray tracing looks bad in Gears 5, though. Compared with the previous version of the game, the software ray tracing renders shadows much more accurately. Gears 5 has been a technical marvel since launch, and with the power of Series X, it looks better than ever. Maneater Maneater features ray-traced reflections and refractions on Xbox Series X, which makes a huge difference for a game that takes place primarily underwater. It\u2019s an open-world sandbox where you play as a shark terrorizing shallow waters. As you gnash through aquatic and land-bound foes, you\u2019ll earn perks and experience, allowing you to grow and take on larger threats. The Medium The Medium is a pretty, if under-optimized, Xbox Series X exclusive that features ray-traced reflections . The feature is available on Xbox Series X and PC, and the Series X version is capped at 30 fps. The Medium is a physiological horror game that follows a medium named Marianne as she ventures deep into an abandoned communist resort. The game is rather unique as far as adventure/puzzle titles go, featuring a dual reality mechanic where two worlds are rendered on screen at the same time. Metro Exodus The enhancements given to Metro Exodus make it look like a brand-new game on the Series X despite being one of the oldest games on this list. Taking place in the post-apocalyptic landscapes of Russia, both the interior and exterior locations were begging for this lighting upgrade. It\u2019s just as much a survival horror game as a FPS, so lighting was always a major component in setting the tone of the Metro games. And with the dynamic day and night cycle in this latest entry, it just makes the dread all the more palpable. NBA 2K21 Sports games are rarely a reason to upgrade to next-gen, but NBA 2K21 makes a compelling argument. The difference is night and day, bringing the character models, courts, and animations to life in a way that no sports game has done before. As a game, NBA 2K21 continues to build on 2K\u2019s sports franchise, featuring the MyCareer and MyTeam modes, as well as franchise mode. NBA 2K21 doesn\u2019t change much when it comes to gameplay, but the graphical improvements are worth the price of admission alone. Observer: System Redux Bloober Team Of all the genres, horror games are some of the best suited to getting the ray-tracing treatment. Observer: System Redux perhaps is the best proof of this due to it being both a horror and cyberpunk-style game. The dark, neon, and technological environments are now truly engrossing on the Series X, putting the game on par with the PS5, which already supported ray tracing for the title. Poker Club You know ray tracing is hitting the mainstream when a poker game decides it\u2019s an important graphical feature. Poker Club is one of the most unlikely games to support ray tracing, but it does. While you\u2019re bluffing your way to an early demise, at least you\u2019ll be able to spot a few accurate reflections bouncing off your chips. Resident Evil: Village Another game we had to wait a bit to get fully optimized, Resident Evil: Village on the Series X also comes with a few new options depending on what you want to prioritize. If you\u2019re looking to make the dingy, mist-covered village and candlelit interiors pull you in like never before, the ray-tracing option is quite impressive. Not only does it allow the resolution to hit up to 4K, but you can also keep HDR on and get a decent 45 frames per second. Watch Dogs: Legion Watch Dogs: Legion was one of the few Series X games available at launch, and although the game itself is a bit prosaic, it still looks great. It\u2019s a great showcase of early-gen ray-tracing effects and a benchmark that will likely be compared to future releases. Legion continues the story of Watch Dogs 2, following DedSec as they recruit, hack, and fight to build a resistance against the oppressive private military group Albion.

    "full_description": "A huge number of teachers don't like the online mode of teaching. This is so despite the fact that it was the only viable solution for students when the Covid-19 first hit India. At that time, fear drove every person's and every government's actions. Among the biggest decisions was to protect the children by closing all schools and other educational institutions. However, to ensure that some kind of continuity regarding studies was maintained, online education was recommended. Exams too shifted to the online mode. Now, a survey has revealed what teachers really think about online education. According to a survey, some 43 per cent of teachers said they were not satisfied with online teaching during the pandemic. Not just that, there was more. In fact as many as 9 per cent of them said they were completely dissatisfied with the online education, PTI reported. This was revealed by an online survey published in the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights' (DCPCR) first journal -- Children First: Journal on Children's Lives. A total of 220 school teachers participated. Why teachers were not happy with online education 1. Absenteeism (14 per cent) 2. Children with special needs not being considered (21 per cent) 3. Low attention span of students (28 per cent) 4. Emotional issues expressed by the students (19 per cent) 5. No assessment or assignment completion by the students (10 per cent). The survey also revealed that, for a successful transition to the online mode, a number of pre-requisites are necessary. \"The pandemic shifting of those necessities still poses a major challenge to online learning,\" it said. What can make online education a success 1. Accessibility of digital platforms 2. Affordability of digital platforms 3. Need-based curriculum and pedagogy 4. Sufficient capacity building of the learning community. No face-to-face access to students has its own negative points for teachers. The teachers stressed that the involvement of parents became necessary in school education because only they have regular access to children. Among the big personal challenges mentioned by teachers was keeping up with online teaching schedules and fulfilling their responsibilities at home at the same time. Notably, students too participated in the survey. They said that they missed school activities, including meeting friends, interacting with people, celebrations, and friendships. Others said that they were overloaded with academic exercises.",

[+] Hayle, Cornwall, England, Wednesday, June 9, 2021. The sculpture, created by British artist Joe Rush ad sculptor Alex Wreckage, named Mount Recyclemore, aims to highlight the growing threat of e-waste. (AP Photo/Jon Super) ASSOCIATED PRESS According to the United Nations Global e-waste monitor, global e-waste volumes grew 21% between 2104 and 2019. in 2019, worldwide, there are more than 53.6 million tons of discarded e-waste. Based on this data, the report predicts that global e-waste will reach 74 megatons by 2030, doubling waste tonnage in 16 years, making e-waste the world's fastest-growing domestic waste stream. Jessica Klodnicki, Skullcandy CMO and head of the brand's sustainability task force says the consumer electronics industry has not educated consumers on the implications of their products' impact or given guidance on how to dispose of products at the end of life properly. Klodnicki says that because Skullcandy's target consumer is predominantly Millennial and Gen Z, the company started to know them better. \u201cIt was clear that they expect brands to solve significant issues facing the world, including climate change.\u201d \"Sustainability in e-commerce often focuses just on production and logistics, but what comes after a product's lifecycle is being neglected,\" said Klodnicki. \"Once the product is with the customer, it's none of our business, right? Wrong. Businesses and consumers need to evolve and adapt circular economy programs to take recycling a step further.\" Skullcandy's upcycle program was started in 2019 with a portion of proceeds from upcycled sales going to advance the causes championed by Protect Our Winters (POW), a climate advocacy organization. Three years later, the company has committed to keeping one million pounds of e-waste from landfills around the world by the close of 2025. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event \u201cConsumers generate around 40 million tons of electronic waste every year worldwide, and only 12.5% of e-waste is recycled,\u201d says Klodnicki. \u201cThis means the remainder of products is being discarded in landfills or sent to incinerators, which release harmful toxins into the air,\" Klodnicki said it was intimidating for the brand to acknowledge they were a small player contributing to the issue. \"We felt it was important to take ownership and action on the matter. We started the program in the US and Canada, partnering with a well-respected facility to handle the upcycling and proper recycling process,\" said Klodnicki. \"We took our learnings and expanded the program into Europe and the UK. Fast forward to 2021; we began doing extensive research around carbon offsets and becoming carbon neutral.\" Klodnicki says Skullcandy is aware that this is an important, yet controversial subject. \"The research we found was complicated and often not congruent, but we felt and still feel that it is important for the company to work towards being carbon neutral as soon as possible,\" said Klodnicki. \"We chose to look at something we could effect immediately and set a large-scale goal around, which was withholding one million pounds of e-waste from landfills,\" said Klodnicki. \"We have the tools to track our impact (or lack of) and now have the information to further educate our retailers to partner with us in keeping products out of landfills,\" added Klodnicki. Since the launch of the Skullcandy circular commerce program, 439,216 units of product have been upcycled or recycled, which Klodnicki says equates to 458,450 pounds or close to 10,000,000 AA batteries of returned products withheld from landfills globally. \"Our new Grind Fuel and Push Active True Wireless Earbuds tackles this issue head-on by allowing over-the-air updates to consumers' earbuds, so consumers don't have to completely replace the hardware just because a new feature is available,\" added Klodnicki. By the close of 2021, Skullcandy says it also plans to have packaging exclusively utilize 100% recyclable packaging. And, by the end of 2023, the company will shift away from plastic to solely using FSC certified paper products. Klodnicki says the company hopes that more consumer electronics brands will recognize the severity of e-waste in landfills worldwide and prioritize being proactive versus reactive to the problem. \"We are being transparent about the initiatives and goals we have in place while also following our climate change partner's mission of progress over perfection,\" adds Klodnicki. In partnership with Carbon Checkout, Skullcandy launched a Carbon Checkout program on four of their global websites that encourage customers to offset their footprint on digital orders at the time of purchase. Klodnicki says that offsets in North America go towards a landfill gas capture project in Virginia, and international offsets fund a wind farm project in Bulgaria. But carbon offsets are not without controversy. In June 2021, Bloomberg reported on the dilemma of trying to decide what offsets should be traded and who can buy them. Shopify committed to investing at least $1 million each year into carbon sequestration ; Etsy announced in 2019 that it would pay for high-quality carbon offsets for consumers using its site. But Klodnicki says that since the launch of their program in August 2021, customers have already offset their purchase nearly 1,700 times. \"This means that Skullcandy's Carbon Checkout program hits above the industry standard, having achieved 11% redemption thus far.\"",

    "full_description": "Chinese electric vehicle startup Xpeng Inc. unveiled details of new products and features including an assisted driving system, a faster charging infrastructure and a flying car as it signaled its intent to expand from its auto-manufacturing roots. The Guangzhou-based company also launched the prototype of a ridable robot horse at its so-called \u201cTech Day.\u201d Xpeng said 60% of its users have paid for the assisted-driving feature, called the navigation-guided-pilot function, which can be used on highways now. That contributed to the company\u2019s total revenue and boosted optimism it can make profit from the intelligent system, Xpeng said. \u201cOur exploration of more efficient, safer, carbon-neutral mobility solutions goes far beyond just smart EVs, and is the cornerstone of our long-term competitive advantages,\u201d Chairman He Xiaopeng said on Sunday. He added that new energy vehicle penetration rate will reach 50% by 2025. An upgraded version of Xpeng\u2019s assisted-driving feature known as XPILOT 3.5 will navigate drivers in cities as early as mid-2022, said Wu Xinzhou, vice president of Xpeng\u2019s autonomous driving unit, though an actual rollout will depend on the product development and local regulations. The company will also partner with others to explore robo-taxi operations starting from the second half of next year. An advanced point-to-point driver assistance program known as XPILOT 4.0 is planned for rollout in the first half of 2023, and will be equipped on Xpeng\u2019s next product -- an electric sports utility vehicle. Assisted Driving The intelligent driving system isn\u2019t fully autonomous but an assisted one, where human intervention is needed, the company said. Drivers will also be required to learn and conduct safety tests that \u201cset clear boundaries\u201d before activating the driver assistance functions, and be put under constant monitoring of their behavior. Li Xiang, chief executive officer of Chinese EV startup Li Auto, earlier urged the industry to be more careful when using terms such as autonomous or self-driving amid rising cases of accidents suspected to be caused by the confusion. \u201cThe drivers are still ultimately responsible for their own safety even when using assisted-driving functions,\u201d Li said. Xpeng also presented a road map for its comprehensive charging network, which includes a mass-produced silicon carbide high-voltage fast charging platform, 480 kW super charger piles, a geographically-expanded charging facility deployment and technology boost for in-house charging and power storage. The company also showed designs for a low-altitude flying car developed by its affiliate HT Aero, which just raised more than $500 million from investors and expected to mass produce the vehicles in 2024. The prototype of a robot horse, equipped with bionic senses and multi-mode recognition technologies, is also part of Xpeng\u2019s product lineup. In August, Tesla Inc.\u2019s Elon Musk unveiled plans to launch a robot prototype sometime next year.",

I have written a lot about Facebook in the last three years because it is the fulcrum for several challenging debates about the concept of brand, social, and even economic responsibility in a digital economy. Leadership in the new digital world has some complex dynamics which most of us were never trained to handle, yet we are faced with managing now. You cannot disguise this tension with a simple re-branding exercise. UNITED STATES - 2009/02/21: USA, Washington State, Seattle, Pike Place Market, Fresh Seafood Stand, ... [+] Flying Fish Show, Vendor Throwing Salmon. (Photo by Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket via Getty Images) LightRocket via Getty Images It's effortless to dismiss responsibilities in a marketplace or platform economy around products. Much like a fish market, each customer decides to transact with a vendor. They don't know if the fish on show stinks unless they smell it or actually have a detailed knowledge of fish or cook it at home. How many of us have that level of expertise to judge the quality of fish available? We trust the vendors and the marketplace. Information can be much the same as fish in a fish market. We often take a vendor at their word. We don't know what is fresh, authentic, truthful, and that's actually what we are being told it is. Logic says not to buy fish late on a Saturday evening or first thing Monday. However, that is still not a perfect filter. If we get burnt with the experience, we don't go back to that vendor. Unfortunately, no matter what Facebook does, it seems to refuse to accept that for the market to flourish in the long run, it has to be exponentially more responsible to all the people on its platform. It is far tougher to work out the freshness of data, pictures, ideas, and expressions than it is to work out the freshness of fish in a market. In the last few days' Facebook executives have leaked the idea that governments should regulate content standards for all tech companies. Governments are notoriously slow, clumsy and by their very nature politically tarnished.

The fish toss and catch is a traditional campaign stunt held for candidates passing through the city. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Getty Images If Facebook or The Facebook is going to attempt to continue to operate as one of the great breeds of technology, part of their responsibility will be to lean in and actively solve this challenge in the same way the fish market owner has to orchestrate quality control. All of us recognize the inherent difficulties behind quality controlling experiences and ideas that Facebook faces. However, if you are making money bringing eyeballs and brains into that market or platform, you have to be incredibly transparent about that journey and process. The recent whistleblowers on Facebook are a concerning reminder of how important transparency is for leaders in a digital economy. A lack of transparency and responsibility killed E-Bay's long-term growth. Solving it has been a boon to Etsy and how they handle quality control. Airbnb, too, has learned the importance of protecting the platform's power for the whole collective, their renters, the boarders, the neighbors, employees, etc. That filter is far tougher to achieve in a place where what is mostly for sale are opinions, beliefs, illustrations of ideas, and lives. As the owner of this marketplace, Facebook has to see information like a product. They have to be responsible for un-truths and false representations, and predatory behavior. We buy experiences and ideas in a digital economy and not just things. Facebook is selling us time, ideas, expressions, or windows into our lives; a simple rule should apply to all include have to take responsibility for this, or you should not be enabled to make money. There is a good reason why Google fell away from social platforms. There is sound logic for how Microsoft has abandoned China as it could not deliver true honest transparency for its users. The Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, testified before the House Financial Services Committee (Photo by ... [+] Aurora Samperio/NurPhoto via Getty Images) NurPhoto via Getty Images In full disclosure, my opinions have evolved rapidly here as we have all watched the power of these markets to amplify, vector, and even distort the facts. In July 2019, I wrote about Zuckerberg's then planned move to become a digital currency bank. In July 2020, I wrote a piece defending the idea of free markets and Facebook. In April of this year , I wrote in Forbes about the threat to sovereign currencies from athletes and celebrities, including Facebook. Facebook has a simple responsibility. Be transparent about the challenges; nobody is going to other markets for social interactions with this much intensity and passion. The marketplace or platform in a technology market will only be as good as the company's leaders are. Their transparency is the cost of winning in a digital world where experiences and ideas are sold like fish in the fish market.",

    "full_description": "Our planet is changing. So is our journalism. This story is part of a CBC News initiative entitled \" Our Changing Planet \" to show and explain the effects of climate change and what is being done about it. Britain's new envoy to Ottawa says Canada still has credibility as a reliable partner on fighting climate change despite a domestic rise of greenhouse gas emissions in recent years. Susannah Goshko, the newly arrived British high commissioner to Canada, says the current Trudeau government has shown \"huge leadership\" on the international stage in the fight against climate change. That's because Canada has doubled its financial commitments to climate financing and raised its emissions-reductions targets, which is putting pressure on other countries, Goshko said. Goshko offered the assessment in a wide-ranging interview as the United Kingdom prepares to host what are seen as pivotal United Nations climate talks in Scotland next month, known as COP26. British and UN flags fly in Parliament Square, in London on Sunday ahead of the UN climate conference COP26 that will be held in Glasgow next week. (Alberto Pezzali/AP) Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced criticism from his political opponents and from environmental groups during the recent federal election because Canada's carbon emissions actually rose from 2015 to 2019, the most recent years for which data is available. While new Liberal policies might have driven down emissions in the two years since then, the current data has fuelled the narrative that Canada's reputation on fighting climate change has been diminished since Trudeau's 2015 participation in the Paris climate agreement in the weeks after he won power. Not so, in Britain's view, said Goshko. \"I think that there's no question it's hard to do what needs to be done to reach our climate goals. A transition to a net-zero economy is really, really tricky. And I think the important thing, as far as Canada is concerned, is the commitment is there,\" she said. Canada has shown 'huge leadership': Goshko Net zero is the term that means no new emissions would be added to Earth's atmosphere, with nature or technology capturing any that are produced. Canada pledged this year to reach net zero by 2050, and has also raised its emissions-reduction targets from 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, to 40 to 45 per cent. Have questions about COP26 or climate science, policy or politics? Email ask@cbc.ca. Those new commitments, as well as Canada's partnership with Germany to help deliver $100 billion US in financing to poorer countries to help them fight climate change, mean that \"Canada's shown huge leadership,\" Goshko said. \"It's the kind of leadership we need because we need all countries now to really be stepping up on those commitments if we're to make COP a success.\" Goshko said it's crucial that China, as the world's largest emitter, play a role in COP26, but her government is still waiting to find out whether President Xi Jinping will be joining the estimated 120 world leaders in taking part in the opening of the meeting in early November. What would make the COP26 climate conference a success? The world is aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050. Here's what that means Despite China's voracious appetite for energy, including the coal-fired variety, Goshko said it is also the world's largest investor in renewable energy, which makes it a valuable partner in fighting climate change. Goshko has had a front-row seat to Britain and Canada's fraught engagement with China in recent years. She served two years as the principal private secretary to the recently departed British foreign minister Dominic Raab. She witnessed firsthand the personal friendship that Raab and his former Canadian counterpart, Francois-Philippe Champagne, forged during in-person meetings in London before and after the onset of the pandemic. Raab was enthusiastic to pursue a deeper alliance with Canada especially given Britain's departure from the European Union, said Goshko. LISTEN | Two climate experts on Canada's climate challenges at COP26 8:47 Canada\u2019s climate questions The Stockholm Environment Institute\u2019s Peter Erickson explains why Canada\u2019s oil and gas production is at odds with its climate goals, and climate scientist and UBC professor Simon Donner explains what Canada has to do to meet those goals. 8:47 That manifested itself in supporting Canada in countering China's imprisonment of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, which only ended in September after nearly three years. Raab was an early supporter of Canada's international effort to create a declaration against arbitrary detention by states, she said. And Canada was an eager participant in international efforts to criticize China for human rights violations in Hong Kong and bring in sanctions over abuses in its Xinjiang province against Muslim Uyghurs, she said, undaunted by the fact China was holding two of its nationals in apparent retaliation for the arrest of Chinese executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant. New climate alliance to push for phasing out oil and gas at upcoming climate conference CBC Radio's The House: Is COP26 our 'last, best hope'? \"I can't think of a time where we came to Canada and said, 'We'd like to do something on this,' and the answer was no,\" said Goshko. AUKUS not a replacement for Five Eyes Goshko also played down any suggestion that Britain snubbed Canada by forming a new alliance, known as AUKUS, with Australia and the United States. The alliance is designed to help Australia acquire a fleet of nuclear submarines to cope with the rising regional influence of China. France was angered by the move, but Trudeau has shrugged it off, saying Canada has no interest in nuclear submarines. Britain's military and security co-operation with Canada remains strong in other areas, including its collaborations through NATO in eastern Europe as a counterweight to Russia, and a recent agreement to deepen co-operation in the Arctic, she said. Analysis Experts call for an overhaul of Canada's national security policy to cope with an 'angry' world Goshko said Britain's alliance with Canada in the Five Eyes intelligence sharing network (with Australia, the United States and New Zealand) remains a top priority that does not clash in any way with AUKUS. All members of the Five Eyes are continually working to strengthen its capability. \"I don't see AUKUS in any way, intention, in conflict with the Five Eyes,\" she said. \"There's no sense for us that one comes at the expense of the other.\"",

    "full_description": "This week\u2019s image from the Hubble Space Telescope shows an odd couple: One large spiral galaxy and its diminutive companion. This pair of interacting galaxies is known collectively as Arp 86. The larger spiral galaxy is NCG 7753, and the smaller galaxy seen in the bottom left is NGC 7752. They are close enough together that the smaller NGC 7752 seems to be almost touching one of the spiral arms of NCG 7753 \u2014 which is why they are given one shared name, in which \u201cArp\u201d stands for the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies, a list of unusual galaxies compiled by astronomer Halton Arp in 1966. This observation from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope showcases Arp 86, a peculiar pair of interacting galaxies which lie roughly 220 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Pegasus. Arp 86 is composed of the two galaxies NGC 7752 and NGC 7753 \u2013 NGC 7753 is the large spiral galaxy dominating this image, and NGC 7752 is its smaller companion. ESA/Hubble & NASA, Dark Energy Survey, J. Dalcanton This list of unusual galaxies includes spiral galaxies with three arms, or with just one, or with one arm heavier than the others, as well as strangely shaped amorphous galaxies, or double or multiple interacting galaxies. The full catalog is available on Caltech\u2019s website , but for a more easily readable version of the list with example images of the different types of galaxies, you can peruse the list on Wikipedia . As for Arp 86, as well as being peculiar, it could help astronomers to understand how stars form in cold gas environments. \u201cHubble observed Arp 86 as part of a larger effort to understand the connections between young stars and the clouds of cold gas in which they form,\u201d Hubble scientists write . \u201cHubble gazed into star clusters and clouds of gas and dust in a variety of environments dotted throughout nearby galaxies. Combined with measurements from ALMA [the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array], a gigantic radio telescope perched high in the Chilean Andes, these Hubble observations provide a treasure trove of data for astronomers working to understand how stars are born.\u201d The Hubble scientists also write that their observations of Arp 86 will be built on by future research by the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope. Webb, which will be the world\u2019s most powerful space telescope, will study a wide variety of subjects in its first year including looking for exoplanet atmospheres and looking back in time to study the earliest galaxies. Relevant to Arp 86 is its study of star formation, which will look at how stars are born in dusty regions of galaxies like Arp 86.

    "pubDate": "2021-10-24 16:45:00",
    "full_description": "SASKATOON -- While scientists from the University of Waterloo were examining a 2.5-billion-year-old ruby, they discovered a rare find: evidence of ancient life. Their clue was the carbon residue, or graphite, recently found encased inside of some of the oldest gemstones in the world. \u201cThe graphite inside this ruby is really unique. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve seen evidence of ancient life in ruby-bearing rocks,\u201d Chris Yakymchuk, lead researcher and University of Waterloo professor, said in a press release . Some of the oldest ruby deposits in the world are in Greenland. This is where the team discovered a ruby sample which contained graphite -- a mineral made of pure carbon. Analysis of the material found the graphite in the ruby showed remnants of early life, potentially long-dead cyanobacteria. The graphite was found in rocks dating back 2.5 billion years ago in an era when there wasn\u2019t a lot of oxygen in the atmosphere and the the majority of life was microorganisms and algae films, the team said. Yakymchuk\u2019s team recently published their finding in November edition of the peer-reviewed journal Ore Geology Reviews , with the journal Chemical Geology publishing their earlier findings in June. Yakymchuk\u2019s team was initially studying the stones\u2019 geology to better understand what conditions are needed to form rubies. \u201cThe presence of graphite also gives us more clues to determine how rubies formed at this location, something that is impossible to do directly based on a ruby\u2019s colour and chemical composition,\u201d Yakymchuk said in the release. But just because graphite was found initially didn\u2019t necessarily mean it was life. To find out for sure, Yakymchuk\u2019s team analyzed a property called isotopic composition, which measures the relative amounts of different carbon atoms. More than 98 per cent of all carbon have a mass of 12 atomic mass units (carbon-12). But sometimes, the carbon atoms are heavier, having a mass of 13 or 14 atomic mass units. \u201cLiving matter preferentially consists of the lighter carbon atoms because they take less energy to incorporate into cells,\u201d Yakymchuk said in the release. \u201cBased on the increased amount of carbon-12 in this graphite, we concluded that the carbon atoms were once ancient life, most likely dead microorganisms such as cyanobacteria.\u201d The team also determined that the very presence of graphite not only indicated early life, but allowed for the ruby to exist. It turns out that the graphite changed the chemistry of the surrounding rocks, which allowed for ruby growth. Without the graphite itself, Yakymchuk\u2019s team says it would have been impossible for the rubies to have formed.

    "full_description": "If you haven\u2019t shopped for a credit card in a while, you may see some unfamiliar names in the offerings. Companies like Brim Financial, Float Inc., Caary Capital Ltd., Jeeves Inc., and Neo Financial are part of a growing crop of tech-enabled lenders that are looking to snag a share of the lucrative credit card market from the big banks. Read more: Visa agrees to buy financial technology startup Plaid for US$5.3 billion \u201cWe\u2019ve never had more choices,\u201d said Mikael Castaldo, general manager of everyday banking at Ratehub.ca. On the personal credit card side, companies like Brim and Neo are trying to lure customers with promises of more seamless, app-based digital experience, as well as creative rewards programs that partner with specific brands and perks like no foreign transaction fees. Story continues below advertisement The startups have to be creative with rewards programs because they lack the scale to offer the big sign-up bonuses of the big banks, said Castaldo. \u201cThey\u2019re just getting started, and it\u2019s actually quite difficult to make that margin equation work sometimes for new credit card providers.\u201d 5:09 Finding the best credit cards: What you should be looking for Finding the best credit cards: What you should be looking for \u2013 Feb 28, 2020 On corporate cards, companies like Jeeves, Float and Caary are aiming mostly at startups and small to medium businesses, offering fast sign-up, numerous digital cards, higher credit limits and no personal guarantee, as well as easier integration into some accounting and spend management software. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of room for improvement, given 90 per cent of this is still with local banks,\u201d said Dileep Thazhmon, co-founder and CEO of Jeeves. He said the company, based in New York but with operations across the Americas, had a soft launch in Canada earlier this year and it has become the company\u2019s second biggest market with more than 300 companies signed on. Story continues below advertisement Read more: Canadian consumers are now carrying $2.1 trillion in debt, driven by mortgages Jeeves directly monitors a client\u2019s bank account and uses machine learning to assess risk, which Thazhmon said allows them to offer the higher credit limit and no personal guarantee. \u201cWe trust our underwriting, we trust our risk engine.\u201d The fintech credit card space has gathered steam in recent years, with significant growth in the United States. San Francisco-based Brex Inc. launched its first card in 2018 and was valued at US$7.4 billion in April, and New York-based Ramp Business Co. launched in 2020 and was last valued at US$3.9 billion. Both companies promise a more seamless sign-up experience and continue to add back-end features to help manage expenses. Toronto startups are also looking to get into the space. Caary raised $4.1 million in June and Float secured a $5 million seed round of funding in July, both based on the model of digital-first corporate cards. 5:05 Managing your credit card spending during the COVID-19 pandemic Managing your credit card spending during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 May 7, 2020 The growth in the fintech credit card space recently is due in part to all of the foundational work done across the digital finance landscape in recent years, said Thazhmon. Story continues below advertisement \u201cA company like Jeeves, you could not build this four years ago. You couldn\u2019t build it at this scale, you couldn\u2019t build at this speed, because a lot of the hooks we plug into were only built in the last three or four years.\u201d Read more: Forget payday loans, this is Canada\u2019s new generation of high-interest loans The new competition for the big banks comes as the market is already feeling pressure. Credit card debt fell by $16.6 billion in the first year of the pandemic as people paid down debt, especially those with low credit, who generally pay higher interest. Banks are also seeing more competition from buy-now pay-later models, which some companies like Brim have integrated into their products. But while the new entrants may have innovative offers, they still have a tough road ahead to break into the market, said Abhishek Sinha, who leads EY Canada\u2019s banking technology consulting practice. \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy breaking into the credit card space because you\u2019ve got a very mature, established market and it seems the Canadian consumer \u2026 we are a bit more risk averse, we are a bit more OK with status quo than our cousins down south.\u201d 3:18 Tech company bringing 300 jobs to Winnipeg Tech company bringing 300 jobs to Winnipeg \u2013 Aug 17, 2021 The banks also already cover \u201calmost every kind of card imaginable,\u201d he said, leaving the new entrants to have to find a significant value proposition to get in. Story continues below advertisement \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of fintechs picking up on a niche that\u2019s underserved, I think it\u2019s more fintechs picking up on niche where they think they can differentiate.\u201d He said banks have also boosted their market research, with more focus groups and joint product developments than even a few years ago. Banks have already started to integrate buy-now pay-later options and have been investing heavily in their digital apps and offerings. Castaldo at Ratebub said he sees the banks putting significant resources to keep their dominant position in the market. \u201cThey\u2019re throwing the full weight of their balance sheet and brains behind solving the problem for sure.\u201d \u00a9 2021 The Canadian Press",

Moreover, Rajinikanth himself said that he will be launching the \"first of its kind\" app in his own voice. Undoubtedly, the world is connected by social media apps and they are showing no sign of slowing down. In fact, there is growth everywhere, especially if they are somehow different from the mainstream messenger apps like Twitter or for that matter WhatsApp. The app Rajinikanth is about to launch, is very much different, it is voice based. Rajinikanth will launch the app on Monday, which is also the day that the superstar will receive the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award. What is noteworthy is that Rajinikanth will launch the app that has been created by his daughter Soundarya Vishagan. Rajini says it will be a \"useful app\" for the public. He revealed that Soundarya, by \"her independent efforts, has pioneered the making of a very useful app for people called Hoote.\" \"People can now express through their voice their thoughts, wishes and ideas just like they do in writing in any language of their choice,\" he added. Rajinikanth, who has been chosen to receive the 51st Dadasaheb Phalke Award by the Centre for the year 2020, said that Monday will be \"an important occasion for him\" as he will receive the prestigious honour. He has completed more than 45 years in the Tamil film industry. The Dadasaheb Phalke is awarded for excellence in cinematic achievement. It is the highest film honour in the country and is awarded by the government of India. Rajinikanth will receive the award for his stupendous contribution to Indian cinema. The official Twitter account of Directorate of Film Festivals, India posted this tweet: \"@rajinikanth fondly called as Thalaiva by his fans, will receive the 51st #DadasahebPhalkeAward, India's highest film honour, on Oct 25.\" BJP Rajya Sabha MP Prakash Javadekar had made this announcement in April, 2021. Rajinikanth's movie debut was back in 1975 when he starred in K Balachander's 'Apoorva Ragangal'. Rajinikanth's latest action movie \"Annaatthe\" is all set for a Diwali release.",

This fast-paced genre sees some of the most benefits from frame-rate improvements and smoother, faster loading times, so Series X optimization is one of the best features to look for! We\u2019re running down the top titles to try for your next shooting adventure or multiplayer obsession with the Xbox Series X \u2014 take a look! Further reading The best free Xbox Series X games The best upcoming Xbox Series X games Xbox Series X tips and tricks Call of Duty: Vanguard The next CoD isn\u2019t out quite yet, but it\u2019s already looking like one of the best of this generation, with the latest tech to take advantage of everything the Series X can do. Taking place in WWII, Vanguard focuses on more unique locations like the Pacific Theater, Africa campaigns, and much more. If you want to stay at the forefront of shooters, Vanguard is the game to watch for. It\u2019s fully released on November 5, 2021, and the open beta period has already passed, so you\u2019ll have to wait a bit right now. The good news is that Vanguard supports both cross-progression and cross-platform play, so it should be no trouble finding a party. Halo Infinite A series of delays couldn\u2019t keep Halo Infinite down, and now the game is set for a final release date of December 8, 2021. You can trust that Microsoft has made sure Halo Infinite is optimized for the Series X, so expect a smoother frame rate and better graphics than ever before, including support for 4K, HDR10, Dolby Atmos, and more. This Halo also supports a more open-world map concept that allows for a greater amount of exploration and more dynamic missions. When multiplayer finally arrives, you can bet it\u2019s going to be worth the wait \u2014 there\u2019s even console keyboard and mouse support include for this very purpose, so get ready to get competitive. Call of Duty: Warzone Oh, we aren\u2019t done with CoD yet: If you really don\u2019t want to wait for Vanguard and are looking for an excellent CoD experience to share with your friends, we highly recommend Warzone . It\u2019s somewhere between popular battle royale games like Apex Legends and traditional CoD gameplay, with a combat arena that can hold up to 20 players. The support for 120 fps will work well with a high-quality TV and the Series X, too. Best of all, the game is free to download, so you don\u2019t lose anything by trying it out. Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War Did you love Black Ops ? Then you absolutely need to play Cold War , which is a direct sequel to the first game and includes all the things players loved, including large 40-player PvP modes and zombie mode. It\u2019s also a great pick for those who enjoy the CoD stories and look forward to spending some time with the campaign. On the other hand, if you haven\u2019t played the first yet, it may be time to pick it up first. Tom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow Six Siege Optimized for Series X and ready to go, Rainbow Six Siege is focused on 5v5 action with a long list of different \u201coperators\u201d to choose from, each with their own tools and loadouts depending on what you prefer to play. Find the abilities you like best, from traps and drones to infrared vision and more. It\u2019s a great pick if you like the idea of multiplayers like Overwatch, but prefer games with more realistic shooting experiences. Rainbow Six Siege continues to be updated with new operators and events, although it does have a credits system you\u2019ll need to use if you want to purchase lots of add-ons or cosmetics. Splitgate Splitgate is a unique, free-to-play FPS that\u2019s a perfect choice if you really want to try something new and don\u2019t know what to look for next. The multiplayer shooter is all about creating and using portals. The goal is to master portal use for all kinds of trick shots, evasive moves, perfect grenade throws, and much more. It generally rewards innovation and constantly improving skills, with both casual and competitive options for gameplay. The downside is that there\u2019s no campaign to speak of, and no news if there will be any updates beyond the current 20 maps. Doom Eternal It\u2019s a very good thing that Doom Eternal is optimized for the Series X, because it\u2019s a blast to play and even more fun with graphics and frame-rate improvements. The phrase \u201cmindless fun\u201d applies to a lot of Doom \u2019s blast-away gameplay, but it\u2019s not all mindless \u2014 you have to master the flow of killing and ripping apart enemies to harvest more health and energy: Don\u2019t stop fighting if you want to survive. Mastering an increasing roster of weapons is also a challenge of its own. If you haven\u2019t played before, note that between blasting demons, Eternal has a bit more platforming than many of the other picks on our list. Destiny 2 Destiny 2 is optimized for Series X \u2014 and beyond the graphics boost that will make it more fun than ever to jump, soar, cast, shoot, and smash, the Series X also helps with the game\u2019s loading times, which can get a little depressing on older, slower systems. There\u2019s a ton to do in Destiny 2 if you haven\u2019t played yet, so make sure you grab a buddy to help fill in the details and explain all the space magic, or make friends with others in the Tower. You\u2019ll also want to prepare for the Witch Queen expansion when it arrives early next year!

    "content": "I speak a ton about how Google is largely a company that\u2019s in perpetual beta, and how frustrating that can be for me as an avid user of its services and hardware. It has a vision of reaching the next billion users and with millions of new people coming online for the first time in their lives each week, that\u2019s a pretty ambitious goal. To do this, Google wants to put people at the center of the helpful and inclusive products it builds, but in my personal experience, this feels contradictory to its approach to design. It\u2019s a company that innovates at breakneck speeds, and as you probably already know, innovation hardly ever (if ever) waits for stability, so most Google services and products tend to be buggy, inconsistent and frustrating, despite their helpfulness. I\u2019ve seen this most in its smart home technology, and I complain about it often. Basically, its ever-shifting approach to design and the fact that it\u2019s in its infancy with many of its endeavors means that there is and never will be a consistent user experience. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy to build something that billions of users of varying cultures, use-cases, ages, and so on will find useful, so I applaud Google\u2019s approach, even though I often find it infuriating and disagree with it. On some level, I admire that it\u2019s constantly exploring new avenues, keeping up with the times (and often being way ahead of them), and never putting all of its eggs in one basket, even though these things have serious ramifications for the everyday, casual user. After all, nothing really knows what it wants to be right when it\u2019s created, and everything evolves over time to become the best it can be. Despite this admiration, I do think that Google could benefit from finding new ways to reinstate its personal connection with its users and to reinvigorate and retain that sense of grassroots that it was built and initially operated on. There\u2019s no denying that the company has grown well beyond that, even becoming one of the most important innovators and influencers of the culture of the 21st century, but if it can find a way to make its adoring fans and users feel like they still matter beyond just being just a number, then I think it\u2019s going to achieve something that\u2019s never really been done before. It can be said that with the introduction of the Google Assistant, Google has attempted to template or bottle this personal connection so that it could distribute it to billions of people, taking the weight of this effort off of its shoulders, but on some level, this feels like only half of the equation. The company itself still needs to have and exude that same sentiment and when users look at how it handles their concerns and how they develop around their needs, they need to feel heard and that these products are still designed specifically for them. At this time, I don\u2019t feel as though Google does this well, but that\u2019s just my opinion. Despite this, I believe that its goal of reaching the next billion users will be achieved for several reasons. First, it has excellent documentation that\u2019s mostly kept up to date, and the community as a whole supports each other out of a passion for the company\u2019s products and services, so it kind of has free, baked-in tech support that runs itself and keeps itself afloat. Not only that, but when you\u2019re sitting on a mountain of cash, you hardly have to care about what people think when you\u2019re creating something, even if you\u2019re \u201ccreating it for the users\u201d. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s their heart on the matter, but I do think that the culture at Google has taken on this form, even if the people that make it up wish for the opposite. A well-oiled machine is still a machine, right? Maybe it should consider slowing its growth a bit to be certain it doesn\u2019t self-destruct or abandon those who gave it legs and a voice in the first place. Maybe it just needs to be more strategic than it has been around that explosive growth. I\u2019m just not sure. Today, I\u2019m just giving you all my thoughts in a stream of consciousness in hopes that we can begin a discussion around these concerns. All I do know is that its current trajectory isn\u2019t sustainable, as proven by the giants that came before it. Those giants have fallen, and if Google continues to stand on their shoulders, it won\u2019t be high off of the ground. Google has become very good at creating commercials that give you warm fuzzies, but I don\u2019t exactly see that same heart or effort reflected in the way it executes on its products and vision \u2013 not all the time. I understand that this growth and maturing process it\u2019s going through as a company takes time, but at what point do we learn to separate the emotion from the action it takes? It can be deceiving, but I think we need to be intentional and hold Google accountable in this way. Call it to deliver on its promises, make better attempts to release functional products that need fewer iterations before they\u2019re usable even on a foundational level, and even to commit to its efforts even after it sees them flounder a bit.

Billions of people rely on the company\u2019s services to do business, make money, and change lives all around the globe. In the past, at least its core products like Search, News, Gmail, and so on have remained largely unchanged and unwavering in their identity and ethics, and that\u2019s created a sense of comfort in a rapidly changing, and terrifying tech world for so many. Today, however, even beyond the uncertainty surrounding Google Stadia, among many of the other big pieces that are in play, even those core services are compromising on their vision and values, and that is what rips the rug out from under people\u2019s feet. Not only that, but for the next billion users who just aren\u2019t familiar with technology, Google needs to do better to provide a familiar, safe space that may be ever-changing but refuses to alter its foundation.

    "full_description": "I speak a ton about how Google is largely a company that\u2019s in perpetual beta, and how frustrating that can be for me as an avid user of its services and hardware. It has a vision of reaching the next billion users and with millions of new people coming online for the first time in their lives each week, that\u2019s a pretty ambitious goal. To do this, Google wants to put people at the center of the helpful and inclusive products it builds, but in my personal experience, this feels contradictory to its approach to design. It\u2019s a company that innovates at breakneck speeds, and as you probably already know, innovation hardly ever (if ever) waits for stability, so most Google services and products tend to be buggy, inconsistent and frustrating, despite their helpfulness. I\u2019ve seen this most in its smart home technology, and I complain about it often. Basically, its ever-shifting approach to design and the fact that it\u2019s in its infancy with many of its endeavors means that there is and never will be a consistent user experience. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy to build something that billions of users of varying cultures, use-cases, ages, and so on will find useful, so I applaud Google\u2019s approach, even though I often find it infuriating and disagree with it.

    "full_description": "Visuals in video games have improved drastically over the past few decades, with characters and environments inching ever closer to realism, and it can make the graphics in older Nintendo or PlayStation 1 games look downright putrid. Video game original soundtracks (OSTs) are a not often talked about aspect of games , but can live on well after their games become unplayable. While game soundtracks have evolved to frequently use orchestras and choruses to add a more dramatic atmosphere, similar to big-budget films , there are absolute classics from the \u201980s and \u201990s that are just as entertaining and catchy today despite being generated with limited bits and synthesized audio. Setting games to music is not a lost art by any means, though: There are plenty of more recent soundtracks already poised to become future classics. Here are the best video game soundtracks of all time \u2014 or, at least, our personal favorites. Super Mario Bros. (1985) When you hear the phrase \u201cvideo game music,\u201d there\u2019s a pretty good chance that the opening tune to the original Super Mario Bros. will just start playing in your head. Whimsical, bouncy, and at a perfect tempo to keep you pushing forward, the music perfectly matches the sound effects made when Mario jumps in the air, breaks blocks, and warps down pipes. When you head underground, the volume drops and the music switches to a minimalist beat that signals the danger ahead. Inch forward in time with the \u201cdo do do do do do\u201d of the music, and you just might make it out the other side alive. Even when you fail, you can\u2019t help but crack a smile, with those few notes punctuating your defeat. When you inevitably run out of lives, and have to start over from the very beginning, the game taunts you even more with a flat-key reimagining of the theme song\u2019s opening notes. Before you have a chance to beat yourself up too much, however, it\u2019s back into World 1-1 and the most memorable tune in video game history. Mega Man 2 (1988) The Mega Man games are notoriously difficult, but without picking up a controller or even seeing footage online, you can tell that Mega Man 2 is going to be relentless from its soundtrack alone. Every stage\u2019s song is a breakneck, anxiety-inducing sprint that you\u2019ll struggle to keep up with, and even the game\u2019s slower tunes, which you\u2019ll hear in Air Man\u2019s theme , are still faster than the majority of music on the NES. It isn\u2019t until you finally defeat Dr. Wily and view the ending credits that you finally get a chance to breathe, as the music switches to a soft, melodic tune as a reward for all your efforts. Later games in the series, like Mega Man X, were certainly able to build on the foundation of Mega Man 2 and deliver something a little more complex, but there\u2019s something charming about the soundtrack\u2019s simplicity. Super Castlevania IV (1991) The Super Nintendo was capable of producing audio far superior to what we heard on the original Nintendo Entertainment System, or even the Sega Genesis, and Super Castlevania IV might just be the best example of what the console could do. Combining the blaring organs associated with gothic horror with the rhythmic chiptune beat Castlevania fans had come to expect, the soundtrack often outshined the game\u2019s visuals, which are still beautiful more than 25 years after the game\u2019s initial release. Even if you loved a particular song from the original Castlevania NES trilogy, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s in Super Castlevania IV , as well. Later stages use reimagined versions of these tunes, including the first game\u2019s Vampire Killer , giving you a healthy dose of nostalgia as you push into Dracula\u2019s Lair. Our favorite song has to be Simon\u2019s Theme , however, as its punchy melody and blistering pace make it the perfect background music as you cut some ghoulish creatures down to size. Chrono Trigger (1995) Square Enix\u2019 masterpiece, Chrono Trigger, has stood the test of time, with some regarding it as the best role-playing game ever conceived due to its complex story, fine-tuned battle mechanics, and Akira Toriyama\u2019s signature character design, and Yasunori Mitsuda\u2019s beautiful score. The opening title screen begins with a soft, ominous tune that hints at more bombastic music later on, but over the course of Crono\u2019s adventure, we hear a wide variety of music. Frog\u2019s Theme , for instance, is as stoic as the knight, but with a tragic undertone that hints at the struggles he\u2019s faced since his transformation. Our favorite music has to involve Magus, arguably the game\u2019s best character. First believed to be an antagonist who wants nothing more than to send the world into peril, he is eventually is revealed to be a more nuanced character who forms an uneasy alliance with the rest of the group. His theme reflects this, always appearing like it will reach a boiling point without ever actually getting there. Star Fox 64 (1997) The collective brainchild of underrated great Hajime Wakai ( Pikmin , Wind Waker , F-Zero X ) and the legendary Koji Kondo, the Star Fox 64 OST is a bombastic and dramatic space opera score that adds drama to what could have been a silly arcade game starring talking animals. Considering each playthrough only lasts an hour, the catchy music makes replaying the game over and over more enjoyable. Each track perfectly captures the mood of the mission and planet. The classic Area 6 score evokes the desperation of four pilots on a suicide mission through a fleet\u2019s non-stop barrage. Star Wolf was the perfect background for tense dogfighting against your cartoonishly evil rivals. Slower tracks like the Meteo Warp and Aquas captured the deadly beauty of a galaxy just as dangerous as Andross\u2019 forces. What held the Star Fox 64 soundtrack back was its MIDI tools, which couldn\u2019t quite live up to the orchestrated sound Wakai and Kondo were trying to achieve. But jump ahead to Star Fox Assault \u2014 which cribbed much of the same music \u2014 and the Super Smash Bros. games\u2019 re-orchestrations for the Star Fox levels, and you\u2019ll find that the music achieves its full Hollywood-esque potential. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998) The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is often regarded as one of the greatest video games ever made, and while that praise stems largely from its fantastic world design and time-traveling story, it would be downright criminal to discount composer Koji Kondo\u2019s contribution to the title\u2019s success. From the moment Link wakes up as a child and begins walking around Kokiri Forest, the light, calming music sets the mood \u2014 it\u2019s soothing almost to hide the fact that the nearby area of Hyrule is soon going to plunge into darkness. Handing you an ocarina, the game has you bring some of the series\u2019 most iconic themes to life: Zelda\u2019s, Epona\u2019s, and Saria\u2019s themes not only stand the test of time but also play important gameplay roles as you progress through dungeons or navigate the Lost Woods. Ganondorf\u2019s theme, on the other hand, portrayed the villain\u2019s menacing danger so well that it made a reappearance in several sequels. Of course, few things are more exhilarating than charging across Hyrule Field on Epona as the music crescendos into a loud, booming chorus that gives you the confidence you need to defeat Ganondorf. Except, of course, for infiltrating Gerudo\u2019s Valley , with its often-remixed score evoking exhilaration and danger while far from home. Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater (1999) Punk rock and skateboarding grew up together, and Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater reflects that, setting an upbeat tone with pop, punk, and ska earworms that found a new audience, and a popularity that extended beyond the game. With tunes from acclaimed bands such as the Suicide Machines, Dead Kennedys, and the Vandals, the game had the perfect soundtrack to listen to for hours as you attempted to master your \u201cMcTwist\u201d or replicate the 900 you saw Mr. Hawk complete on TV. One song has come to represent the THPS franchise\u2019s cultural footprint more than any other: Goldfinger\u2019s horn-infused ska track Superman is so relentlessly upbeat and catchy, it\u2019s virtually impossible to get upset when you\u2019re listening to it. The other games in the franchise all feature strong soundtracks, but without Superman , they all seem to be lacking something. Halo 2 (2004) The original Halo introduced us to the series\u2019 signature, choir-heavy theme song, and the third game ended with an emotional piano number that offered what we thought was definitive closure to Master Chief\u2019s story. But neither can compare to the electric guitar shredding of Halo 2 . Early in the game, we\u2019re reacquainted with the Covenant\u2019s deadly Hunter enemies, which typically strike fear into our hearts the second they burst onto the scene. But with Steve Vai\u2019s solo blaring in our ears, we had the confidence to charge in with our guns blazing. When we switch perspectives and take control of the Arbiter, the music takes on a horror tinge, one peppered with sullen, tragic moments that remind us of the impossible mission he must complete. Of course, gamers who spent hours in Halo 2 matchmaking will remember the game as much for its heart-wrenching menu music like Heavy Price Paid and Unforgotten . Allegedly named \u201cunforgotten\u201d because the composer Marty O\u2019Donnell forgot he had scored it until Halo 2 was nearly out, it really evokes the tragedy and memory of all the humans and duped Covenant dying in a senseless war. The theme unsurprisingly returned in Halo 3 and Halo 4 . Even the game\u2019s controversial, cliffhanger ending was made more bearable by the soundtrack. As Master Chief utters his famous \u201cSir, finishing this fight\u201d line, Marty O\u2019Donnell\u2019s score crescendos and the screen cuts to black. Fans would have to wait three years to discover how the war between the humans and Covenant came to a close, with the score ringing in their ears. Uncharted: Drake\u2019s Fortune (2007) The Uncharted series can be described as a direct descendent of the original Tomb Raider games. The game\u2019s music, however, is one of a few elements that helped Nathan Drake climb out of Lara Croft\u2019s shadow. His theme song can only be described as \u201cepic.\u201d Hearing it transports us to one of the series\u2019 many beautiful, treasure-filled vistas. Drake\u2019s Fortune also knows when to ratchet things back to built up dramatic tension, especially in between gun battles. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bad feeling about this\u201d doesn\u2019t even begin to describe these spooky, otherwise silent sections, where just one false move could send Nathan plummeting into a pile of skeletons or a group of gun-toting mercenaries. Minecraft: Volumes Alpha & Beta (2011\u20132013) It\u2019s not too bold a claim to make that Minecraft probably wouldn\u2019t have sold 200 million copies, becoming the second-bestselling game of all time , unless German composer C418 gave gamers a soothing yet alien soundtrack to fill the emptiness as they explored its near-deserted, endless setting. Peaceful piano solos create a somewhat melancholic ambience as you navigate a world full of scared critters and violent monsters. Then, upbeat electronica gives you a burst of energy, hearkening more to the mood of gamers building blocky buildings and getting up to in-game hijinks with Minecraft mods . Most Minecraft OST fans gravitate toward the first album\u2019s simple classics like Moog City , Sweden , and Subwoofer Lullaby . Don\u2019t sleep on Volume Beta , though, as it moves beyond pieces that are simply \u201cpeaceful\u201d or \u201csad\u201d and creates tracks like Taswell and Kyoto that feel like distinct performances, each evoking its own strange new world. Journey (2012) Composer Austin Wintory spent three years creating the soundtrack for Journey , and this dedication paid off in an incredible soundtrack that was the first and only one to be nominated for a Grammy Award. Wintory made cellist Tina Guo the center of the soundtrack and said in an interview that the game is \u201clike a big cello concerto where you are the soloist and all the rest of the instruments represent the world around you.\u201d Eventually, as you climb the mountain, the cello emerges from the orchestra to represent the completion of your journey. Plus, the soundtrack changes to add new instruments when you meet with other players. Add in his work on Assassin\u2019s Creed Syndicate , Abz\u00fb and the Banner Saga trilogy, Wintory makes a strong case for being the best game composer of the last decade. Rayman Legends (2013) Aside from rhythm games such as Thumper and Guitar Hero Live , it\u2019s rare to see a developer work its music directly into its game\u2019s mechanics, but that\u2019s exactly what Ubisoft Montpellier did in Rayman Legends . After several traditional platforming stages \u2014 each complete with its own lighthearted songs \u2014 each world ends with a lightning-fast platforming sequence set to a popular rock or pop song. Classics such as Black Betty and Eye of the Tiger are recreated with Rayman\u2019s oddball humor (the latter is played entirely on kazoo) as the limbless hero sprints toward the finish line, and his jumps are in perfect time with the songs. Symbol crashes, for instance, ring out whenever Rayman is about to be hit by a cannon blast, and this all happens within the game world, with enemies joining in to perform a concert as they try to kill our hero. Don\u2019t mess up the timing: You\u2019ll ruin the song! BioShock Infinite (2013) If Rayman Legends managed to tie its soundtrack to its gameplay in a way no other game had before, BioShock Infinite achieved a similar meld of music and story. From the moment Booker DeWitt steps foot in the floating city of Columbia, he\u2019s greeted with music that doesn\u2019t exist yet. The Beach Boys\u2019 God Only Knows , is sung by a barbershop quartet, even though the song wouldn\u2019t be written for about 50 years. As the space-time continuum further disintegrates around Booker, he hears tunes from bands such as Creedence Clearwater Revival and even new-wave legends Tears for Fears. Perhaps the most memorable moment in the entire game can actually be skipped if players aren\u2019t nosy enough. After entering a basement, Booker can pick up a guitar and perform Will the Circle Be Unbroken? as a duet with his companion, Elizabeth. You feel their emotions through the speakers, and the song left us thinking about how its lyrics related to the universe, or multiverse, for weeks afterward. Child of Light (2014) Canadian singer-songwriter C\u0153ur de pirate created a moving soundtrack that matches well with the mood of the game, heavy with melancholic violin and thoughtful piano solos before upping the tempo into percussion-heavy battle ballads. Mostly set in a portal fantasy world and starring a young girl desperate to return home to save her dying father and thwart her evil stepmother, this dark twist on a Cinderella story with violence and no Prince Charming shines in part thanks to its beautiful music. Even as Aurora gains powers and friends, the combination of sadness and whimsy reminds us that this journey is not as enjoyable for her as it is for us. Transistor (2014) Most gamers would pick Darren Korb\u2019s excellent Bastion soundtrack for this list, but for our money, Transistor represents Korb\u2019s best work by far. You play as Red, a singer whose voice has been sealed away inside of a mysterious sword and who must fight to defeat the robotic intelligence that is absorbing the city inhabitants into itself. Unable to speak, Red can hum along to the music of each level, and you\u2019ll also hear several former performances of hers over the course of the game. Korb described the genre of the soundtrack as \u201cold-world electronic post-rock,\u201d which really just translates into an intense cyberpunk vibe that matches the action-heavy gameplay and desolate, futuristic world. Add in singer Ashley Lynn Barrett\u2019s amazing voice, used to great effect in songs like We All Become and The Spine , and you get a soundtrack that\u2019s worth listening to over and over. Ori and the Blind Forest (2015) The graphical beauty of the Ori franchise is only matched by its truly gorgeous soundtrack, which was performed by an entire orchestra and choir and features multiple solo performances from Aeralie Brighton, Rachel Mellis, and Tom Boyd. The vocalists\u2019 harmonies sound as if the game\u2019s forest setting is serenading Ori as he progresses along his quest, with solo performances often arising during cutscenes when Ori has taken a step further in cleansing his home of the sickness infecting it. Its excellent production value aside, the Ori and the Blind Forest soundtrack succeeds thanks to Gareth Coker\u2019s thoughtful composition, which creates a new, magical-sounding melody for each new area you encounter and leitmotifs that reflect upon the recurring characters you meet. Nier: Automata (2017) The opening hours of Nier: Automata are accompanied by a melancholy and occasionally cheery soundtrack that mostly exists in the background as you move throughout the open world. The song Rays of Light has a memorable and simple piano tune that you\u2019ll often find yourself humming \u2014 as there is little noise when in the game\u2019s City Ruins \u2014 but the final few notes of the jingle shift toward a more depressing tone that is evocative of the emotional torture you\u2019re about to endure over the course of the game. Emi Evans, the vocalist for many of the tracks, researched linguistics in order to make up a convincing, fake in-game language, Chaos, then harmonized with Keiichi Okabe\u2019s composed melodies in that fake language. Aside from having a beautiful voice, Evans added authenticity and immersion to the game\u2019s outlandish world by creating and singing words that sounded as if they could be a real far-future language. The game\u2019s final moments are where the fantastic soundtrack really hits its high point. An initially quiet, somber tune, The Weight of the World , starts with a solo performance before giving way to an orchestral anthem, with an entire choir of voices joining in as you make your way to the game\u2019s touching conclusion. Even after 2B and 9S finished their journey, we still wanted to \u201cshout it loud.\u201d Persona 5 (2017) The jazzy Persona soundtracks are a big favorite with video game audiophiles, and the Persona 5 OST is full of energetic music encouraging you to \u201cwake up, get up, get out there\u201d . Composer Shoji Meguro frequently uses the electric piano and guitar in the game\u2019s music, adding a synthesized tone that makes your character\u2019s daily Tokyo routine feel just as exciting as the Metaverse. The highlights of the soundtrack come from singer Lyn Inaizumi, who performs a dozen or so pop / R&B songs that will stick in your brain and have you humming them well after you beat the game. They appear as both vocal and instrumental versions depending on the time of day, which is a neat touch. Plus, the game even adds lyrics to some of the fight music, a choice that few other games have ever been bold enough to try. Celeste (2018) Celeste is a challenging game, not only in terms of gameplay, but also in subject matter. The soundtrack perfectly keeps up with the tone set by the game, pulling double duty as background music and sound design. Following your events perfectly, Celeste\u2019 s soundtrack almost feels like a character in the game, sticking with you on the long and often lonely journey up Celeste Mountain. Furthermore, Celeste \u2018s soundtrack perfectly bends the mood of the game to its will, with the opening First Steps offering a hopeful tone in the early moments of the game and songs like Reflection offering a deeper, more methodical tone as your physical and psychological journey continues into a darker place. Celeste also has \u201cB-Side\u201d levels with increased difficulty and fast-paced remixes on the original level themes. While all trippy and adrenaline-pumping in their own way, Reflection (Center of the Earth Mix) is an incredible stand-out track, with the discordant chanting reflecting upon the absurdly deadly environment that your character keeps diving into headfirst. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (2018) Super Smash Bros. Ultimate helped Nintendo transform the Nintendo Switch into the biggest and most impractical MP3 player of all time. Players can access over 30 hours of original tracks and remixes from a huge variety of video game franchises from the game\u2019s Sounds menu and across its 100+ stages. The game lets you listen to your favorite franchises and create custom playlists. Or simply select shuffle and relive some of the best video game music in history, including compositions from several of our other all-time best picks. The Smash Bros. series brought a fun mix of old classics and fresh orchestrations that fans loved. Like with Star Fox 64 , Nintendo used musical technology and sound libraries to remix MIDI soundtracks completely. This meticulous work brought a fresh take to music from franchises like Mario, Zelda, Fire Emblem, Metroid, and Kirby. Another fun spin is that the new DLC characters, like Joker in Persona 5, get their theme music. Doom Eternal (2020) The Doom games are often compared to a heavy metal album cover, only playable. Of course, a heavy metal soundtrack has always been present in the series, but it wasn\u2019t until the reboot in 2016 that we really felt the impact of the music on the game. Composed by Mick Gordon, this soundtrack dynamically adapts to just how hard you\u2019re ripping and tearing through the demonic hordes to perfectly punctuate every shotgun blast and machine gun shell fired. The result is apologetically over-the-top metal, and while it would feel almost cliche in any other context, it fits the brutality of Doom Eternal perfectly. The music is so responsive that it basically becomes a mechanic in the game itself. As noted, the harder you\u2019re killing, the harder the guitars rip and drums beat, but it also cues you in to when certain abilities are ready, when new demons are spawning, or when your health is low. Unfortunately Mick had a falling out with the developers after this game launched, so this may be the last game we get to enjoy his demonic musical talents. Honorable mentions NES has been in households for over 35 years, so our top 20 list doesn\u2019t cover every year. Since there\u2019s such a wealth of great soundtracks, we\u2019re listing our runners-up here. They\u2019re worth a listen, even if they didn\u2019t make the top 20.

    "full_description": "In all the important ways, Back 4 Blood is the co-op zombie shooter that fans have been waiting for since Left 4 Dead 2. It has a few minor tweaks to the gameplay here and there, many improvements to gameplay and progression, and the obvious technical and graphical upgrades that the new generation of hardware affords. If you\u2019ve sunk dozens, or more likely hundreds, of hours into those old classic zombie survival adventures, then Back 4 Blood will be a welcome breath of fresh air in a space that really hasn\u2019t had any comparable games. Of all the changes this game has, though, the biggest is clearly the card system. Cards are modifiers that add another layer of unpredictability to every campaign mission you run. The new A.I. director will still be there to tweak the difficulty, spawning Ridden and items based on how your team is doing to always keep things tense, but cards are on a different level. You will build your own deck to give yourself various buffs and advantages to keep up with the increasing difficulty of the missions. Not all cards are created equal, and you\u2019ll want as many as possible to build the ideal deck. Here are all the ways you can earn new cards in Back 4 Blood. Further reading A beginner\u2019s guide to Back 4 Blood: How to fight back against the horde Back 4 Blood\u2019s card system explained Is Back 4 Blood cross-platform? Complete Accomplishments The first way to get cards in Back 4 Blood is slower and less reliable than the second. You will probably end up just getting some of these cards through natural progression, but some you will have to go out of your way for. And you\u2019ll want to, too, because the cards you get this way are rare and can\u2019t be obtained any other way. Accomplishments are tasks you can do while playing matches. Some are more simple, like getting a number of kills with different weapon types, while others are more like achievements or trophies where you need to do something more specific like complete the Bar Room Blitz mission while making sure the jukebox doesn\u2019t break. For the most part, you\u2019re better off leaving these cards to hunt until later on, or if you see one you really want to get early since a lot will come just by playing normally. Spend Supply Points on Supply Lines Your main source of cards is meant to come from the Supply Lines. You will earn Supply Points by playing and beating missions that you can take to Chenda in the Fort Hope hub zone. You start off with just one Supply Line to show you how it works, but once you complete it, more will open up. These look and act a little like battle passes. You invest your points and unlock a set series of rewards until the line is complete. Thankfully you can see exactly what all the rewards are going to be, including any cards, so you can decide which Supply Lines you want to dump your points into. You will be forced to unlock some other items, like cosmetics, in these Supply Lines as well, but you at least always know what you\u2019re going to get and when, and outside of the cards tied to Accomplishments this is where every card will become available. Test cards out in Solo Finally, while you can\u2019t keep them, you can at least test out any card in the game before you\u2019ve even unlocked it. If you look in your Deck menu and go into the Solo section, you can access every card in the game to build a deck with. This deck can only be used in Solo mode, naturally, where nothing can be unlocked or earned. That makes it a perfect testing ground you can use if you see a card you think would be good to go for but want to make sure before attempting that Accomplishment or spending your Supply Points \u2014 feel free to test it out in Solo mode to make sure.

    "full_description": "After its popularity soared in the wake of the spat between Twitter and the government, homegrown microblogging platform Koo app's user base has touched about 15 million mark. Koo saw a massive growth in its user base when Union ministers and various government departments in India endorsed the app - it is an Indian microblogging platform and an ambitious rival of Twitter. The app's popularity has soared phenomenally with as many as 5 million users added in just the last quarter alone, said co-founder Aprameya Radhakrishna. \"We have seen rapid growth. We are making sure that everything that India celebrates, whether it is language or culture, is resonating on Koo... Be it the cricket, politics, movies, spiritual leaders and their following, everything is being celebrated on Koo in their (users') languages,\" Radhakrishna told PTI. Even though Koo's popularity in India peaked amid the rift with Twitter, it is now looking to spread its wings to far off lands too. While Koo will retain its focus on the Indian market, plans are afoot to venture into the Southeast Asian market after June, 2022. \"For expansion, we will also experiment with (look at) one country in South East Asia...We have not chosen the country but we will definitely want to enter one more market...in Southeast Asia, in second half of next year,\" he said. It is also also available in Nigeria, which it had entered earlier this year. That market \"continues to grow\", Radhakrishna said and revealed that other African countries too may figure on the expansion list. \"Nigeria has been growing well, organically. We are taking this time to understand the cultural aspects of Nigeria, and it continues to grow\", Radhakrishna informed. Koo's strength is providing its service in local languages. \"The premise of entering any market is whether they have significant local language aspect to their community and culture. Those are the countries, that we will enter,\" Radhakrishna said. In fact, the main premise on which Koo was launched last year was to allow users to express themselves and engage on the platform in local languages. Koo in fact supports multiple languages including Hindi, Telugu, Bengali, among others. The app was launched by Radhakrishna and Mayank Bidawatka. Koo will be targetting other areas, apart from the ones mentioned above. Radhakrishna noted that Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines were among the markets that Koo will look at. At the moment, Koo is study these markets and will make the final decision based on that.",

    "full_description": "There\u2019s a serious problem with choosing gaming peripherals these days. With all the options available, we all tend to rely on specs and technical features when choosing products as we search for \u201cthe best.\u201d But unlike a graphics card or processor, there\u2019s precious little that\u2019s objective about something like a gaming mouse. I found this out when I took the SteelSeries Prime out for a test spin. It quickly became my go-to option, and now I can\u2019t go back to using anything else. It\u2019s not because it\u2019s the best. It\u2019s because when it comes to choosing a gaming mouse, fit and feel are king. Staying objective There are a few key specs to pay attention to when looking at a gaming mouse: The sensor and its maximum DPI, the switches and their technology and longevity, and the buttons and how practical they are to use. Wireless connection also plays a role, though honestly, most major mouse makers have fast wireless protocols that offer plenty of battery life. Taken together, those specs tell you \u2026 well, nothing. Sure, I can tell you that a switch lasts for 50 million or 100 million clicks, but that doesn\u2019t say anything about the mouse. You\u2019ll probably replace it long before a switch fails. Similarly, a sensor may sport a resolution of 26K DPI, but only a microscopic fraction of players will ever notice the benefits of such a high resolution. I certainly can\u2019t, and I\u2019ve used most of the best gaming mice you can buy. The SteelSeries Prime Wireless has an 18K DPI sensor, while the $110 Corsair Sabre Pro Wireless comes with a 26K DPI sensor. The Corsair sensor is objectively better and cheaper, but that just doesn\u2019t translate into real-world use. Specs are important when comparing the wide range of gaming mice you can buy. But when you\u2019re dealing with devices from major brands like SteelSeries, Corsair, Razer, and Logitech, most gaming mice are more alike than they are different on the inside. The differences come down to form, functionality, and above all else, preference. Making the difference I recently reviewed the SteelSeries Prime Mini Wireless . It\u2019s a decent gaming mouse, but perhaps not good enough to earn a spot among the best gaming mice on the market, though. The weaker sensor, relatively high price, and annoying wireless dongle just didn\u2019t cut it. Even more, the Prime Mini wasn\u2019t right for me in particular. It just wasn\u2019t the right size for my hand. After having used the more standard-sized SteelSeries Prime Wireless, it became even clearer how much the ergonomics mattered. The SteelSeries Prime Wireless is my favorite gaming mouse right now because I like using it. It\u2019s not because of the sensor, which lags behind the competition, and it\u2019s not because of the wireless technology, which is just as fast as the wireless tech from Corsair, Logitech, and Razer. It\u2019s because the SteelSeries Prime Wireless feels good in my hand. When choosing a gaming mouse, it\u2019s all about the subjective bits: How the mouse is shaped, what the left- and right-clicks feel like, how the mouse looks. Performance is the least important thing to worry about when dealing with high-end gaming mice. I\u2019d choose a mouse from a major brand that has RGB I like over one with a better sensor every time. For the past several weeks, the Corsair M65 Ultra Wireless has been my daily driver. It\u2019s a great mouse, and it comes with the best specs you can find right now. I like the shape, too, but I gravitated toward the M65 because of its listed performance, not because it was the best mouse for me. The Prime Wireless changed that in a matter of days, and I haven\u2019t switched back. That doesn\u2019t mean the Prime Wireless is the best mouse for you \u2014 the point here is that there isn\u2019t one mouse that\u2019s best for everyone. Maybe you prefer the stubby shape of the M65, or you want to use something that\u2019s as light as possible like the Logitech G Pro X Superlight. All three of these mice are wireless, performant, and cost around the same. So, which is the best? It comes down to what you like most. Feel is so important that I would put it above specs, and in some cases, even looks. That\u2019s the case with the Prime Wireless, which still has a lot of problems. Compromise is OK The Prime Wireless has some issues. I don\u2019t like the chunky dongle that occupies the sole USB-C slot on my motherboard, the software is a couple of years behind Corsair\u2019s iCue and Logitech\u2019s G hub, and there\u2019s only a thin, underwhelming strip of RGB lighting around the scroll wheel. If you laid out the 10 top gaming mice and I had to pick one without touching any of them, I wouldn\u2019t choose the Prime Wireless. Still, I continue to use it. It\u2019s OK to compromise on specs, lighting, and even software support for a mouse you like to use. This should be obvious, but it\u2019s all too easy to get caught up in the comprehensive view of a product \u2014 how it stacks up to the competition, and all the bits and bobs that contribute to the experience \u2014 while overlooking what\u2019s most important. Although I don\u2019t have concrete numbers, my Destiny 2 clan said I was playing better with the Prime Wireless. And I felt better playing while using it. Even with my list of problems, I keep using the Prime Wireless. It might not be the best mouse for you, but it\u2019s the best mouse for me. The best for me is not the best for you The Prime Wireless lands in a strange spot in the world of gaming mice. It\u2019s just enough below the competition to not stand out, but for a certain section of the gamers that appreciate the clicks and like the form factor, there\u2019s nothing better. I haven\u2019t gone back to my Razer Viper Ultimate or Corsair Sabre Pro. It\u2019s important, especially with peripherals, to find something you like, not something a review or roundup tells you to buy. I will scream until I\u2019m blue in the face about how Cherry MX Brown key switches are the best for gaming and typing \u2014 but I don\u2019t have a better argument than someone who likes Red switches. The same is true with gaming mice. If you have a local Micro Center or Best Buy, make sure to put your hand on the mouse before buying one. Feel the form, click the switches, slide it across a mouse pad if you can. That will tell you more about if it\u2019s the right mouse for you than a sensor or spec list ever could.

    "full_description": "Just when you thought the Dolphins' season couldn't get any worse... things have somehow nosedived. Doomed to forever be known as the rabble that lost to the Jags, they now get an instant reminder of the London woes by facing the Falcons. Read on as we explain how to get a Falcons vs Dolphins live stream and watch the NFL week 7 game online from anywhere. Date: Sunday, October 24 Time: 1pm ET / 10am PT / 6pm BST / 4am AEDT Venue: Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida TV channel and live stream: Fox ( via Sling TV discount or free fuboTV trial ) Free live stream: DAZN FREE trial (CA) | NFL Game Pass FREE trial (UK, AU) Watch anywhere: try the world's no.1 VPN 100% risk-free And there's further bad news for Brian Flores. Going into a bye week off a victory means the Falcons are still basking in good vibes, plus they've had time to recover from their trip across the pond and prepare a game plan. Matt Ryan looked like a stud out there against the Jets two weeks ago, and from what we saw from the Dolphins last weekend, he should have no problem picking that defense apart today. Tua Tagovailoa has taken a lot of heat, but rather than the young QB who was playing through the pain for the first time since week 2, some of the focus should lie elsewhere, with the Fins' defense and rushing game utterly abysmal against the Jags.

    "full_description": "This one could be tasty. The Chiefs returned to winning ways with an improved showing against a hopeless Washington team last weekend, while the Titans shocked the Bills under the lights on Monday. We're expecting big scores from this, so read on as we explain how to get a Chiefs vs Titans live stream and watch the NFL online from anywhere. Date: Sunday, October 24 Time: 1pm ET / 10am PT / 6pm BST / 4am AEDT Venue: Nissan Stadium, Nashville, Tennessee TV channel and live stream: CBS ( via Paramount Plus FREE trial or FREE fuboTV trial ) Free live stream: Kayo Sports FREE trial (AU) | DAZN FREE trial (CA) | NFL Game Pass FREE trial (UK) Watch anywhere: try the world's no.1 VPN 100% risk-free Derrick Henry ripped off three touchdowns runs, including a blistering 76-yarder, against the Bills, who have one of the better rush defenses in the league. The Chiefs do not. In fact, theirs is the sixth-worst in the NFL. Meanwhile, the Titans have one of the weakest pass defenses in the league, which Patrick Mahomes - even this interception-throwing version - should be able to exploit mercilessly. With both teams having played six games each, it's slightly ludicrous that we're still not sure if either of them are any good or not. We still might not have the answer by the end of this one, but it's got all the ingredients for a cracker. Follow our guide on how to watch the Chiefs vs Titans online and get an NFL live stream wherever you are in the world right now. If you've mismatched a holiday or you're away on business and you want to watch your country's coverage from abroad, then you'll need to use a VPN . This will help you dial in to a location back in your home country to avoid geo-blocks and regain access to the content and services you already pay for back home. A VPN is perfect for this as it allows you to change your IP address so you appear to be in a completely different location when the big game is on. Use a VPN to live stream Chiefs vs Titans from anywhere ExpressVPN - get the world's best VPN We've put all the major VPNs through their paces and we rate ExpressVPN as our top pick, thanks to its speed, ease of use and strong security features. It's also compatible with just about any streaming device out there, including Amazon Fire TV Stick, Apple TV, Xbox and PlayStation, as well as Android and iOS. Sign up for an annual plan now and get an extra 3 months absolutely FREE . And if you change your mind within the first 30 days, let them know and they'll give you your money back without a quibble. - Try ExpressVPN 100% risk-free for 30 days Once you've chosen and installed your VPN of choice, simply open the service's corresponding app, hit 'choose location', select the appropriate country, and you'll be able to watch the broadcast as if you were back at home. Today's Chiefs vs Titans game is being shown on CBS, with kick-off scheduled for 1pm ET / 10am PT. If you haven't already got CBS as part of your cable package, you should know that it's also available on a streaming-only basis on Paramount Plus from just $4.99 a month after a 7-day FREE trial . How to watch Chiefs vs Titans without cable In general though, we recommend fuboTV as the best way to watch NFL games without cable this season. The standard fuboTV plan costs $64.99 per month and includes Fox, CBS, NBC, ESPN and the NFL Network - all the channels you need to tune into every nationally televised NFL game in the 2021/22 regular season. Plus, you also get the benefit of the fact that fuboTV has a 7-day FREE trial . Today's Chiefs vs Titans game kicks off at 1pm ET / 10am PT, and it's being televised by CTV , which also offers streaming access either on a standalone basis or at no extra cost for subscribers. However, Canadian NFL fans are some of the the luckiest in the world, as streaming service DAZN is showing it along with every single game of the 2021/22 season, right the way through to the Super Bowl. And it's an absolute bargain - DAZN costs just CAD$20 a month or $150 a year . Plus, the FREE 30-day DAZN trial lets you try before you buy - essentially meaning you can live stream Chiefs vs Titans free of charge. Not only do you get every single NFL game, including NFL Game Pass and RedZone access, but DAZN's also the exclusive Canadian streaming home of Premier League and Champions League soccer!

The Chiefs vs Titans game kicks off at 6pm BST on Sunday evening, and you can tune in via the NFL Game Pass , which is showing every game of the season live. A subscription costs \u00a314.99 a week or a much better-value \u00a3147.99 for the season, after a 7-day FREE trial. Sky Sports shows at least five NFL games a week but the Chiefs vs Titans game isn't one of this week's featured matchups. And if you don't have Sky Sports as part of your TV package, Now TV will let you stream everything it has to offer without locking you into a lengthy contract. Not in the UK but still want to catch the action? Use a VPN to live stream NFL as if you were at home. This also lets you get around any blackout restrictions that sometimes apply to games. The Chiefs vs Titans game kicks off at 4am AEDT on Monday morning. If you wake up early enough, ESPN, available through Foxtel, is showing the game, and you can also stream it on your laptop or mobile using the Foxtel Go app. Streaming service Kayo Sports is showing the Chiefs vs Titans game too, and is the ideal option for those who don't want the commitment of a lengthy (and pricey) contract. Kayo lets you stream on two devices with it $25 per month Basic plan, and on three devices with its $35 Premium plan, and both come with a FREE 14-day trial . It's also worth bearing in mind that 7Mate shows up to three games a week for FREE, but not this particular one. And if those aren't enough to satisfy your NFL cravings, we highly recommend you sign up for the NFL Game Pass , as it's showing every game of the season live. A subscription costs $28.99 a week or $274.99 for the season, after a 7-day FREE trial. Not in Australia right now? Use a VPN if you're away from home, in order to tap into your domestic coverage.",

    "full_description": "The Apple Watch Series 7 was expected to have a bigger battery capacity than its predecessor since it offered a similar \u201call-day\u201d battery life while offering a larger display. Now, a new teardown video by iFixit has confirmed the presence of a bigger battery inside the wearable. As seen in the video, the Apple Watch Series 7 41mm variant features a 6.8 per cent larger battery while the Apple Watch Series 7 45mm variant features a 1.6 per cent larger battery. Apple also added bigger battery capacities to its entire iPhone 13 lineup this year. Also Read | Apple Watch Series 7 announced: Here\u2019s what is new Apart from this, the Apple Watch Series 7 also features a new display that despite being larger is reportedly easier to work with and that is due to the company\u2019s new OLED display which comes with an integrated touch panel. The feature was also seen in this year\u2019s iPhone 13 series. This also means the display can be swapped as easily as the Taptic engine and the battery. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png Possible cause of delayed release The cause of the delay behind the Apple Watch Series 7 is also expected to be the new display technology. iFixit notes that the manufacturing hiccups with the new screen could have caused the delays.

    "full_description": "From bugs to algae, and from 3D printing to artificial photosynthesis, NASA has announced a plethora of ideas about what the future of food in space could look like. The agency recently held a challenge asking organizations and members of the public to submit their most daring concepts of how to feed astronauts on space missions. NASA astronaut Megan McArthur enjoys fresh food on the International Space Station. NASA NASA\u2019s Deep Space Food Challenge invited chefs, small businesses, and students to submit their innovative ideas about how to develop food for astronauts, with the winning teams receiving a prize of $25,000 each. Some of the winning entries included growing microalgae and dehydrating them into \u201ccrunchy bite-sized snacks;\u201d generating foods from insect cells to be eaten in place of meat products; creating a symbiotic system of algae, yeast, mushrooms, and plants which would grow in 3D-printed artificial soil; an artificial photosynthetic system; and a microbial system which uses \u201cplastic and biomass waste as the carbon source for food generation.\u201d As bizarre and perhaps unappetizing as some of these ideas might sound, being open-minded about different food sources is important for keeping astronauts both mentally and physically healthy on long-duration space missions. \u201cNASA is excited to engage the public in developing technologies that could fuel our deep space explorers,\u201d said Jim Reuter, associate administrator for NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate, in a statement . \u201cOur approach to deep space human exploration is strengthened by new technological advances and diverse community input.

A subscription to Nintendo Switch Online costs $19.99 / \u00a317.99 for a whole year. That\u2019s pretty agreeable, rightly costing less than its competitors on <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ps5\">PS5</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-series-x\">Xbox Series X</a>/S, and throwing in retro titles alongside hugely fun multiplayer exclusives in the form of Tetris 99 and Pac-Man 99 (and Super Mario Bros. 35, may it rest in peace).</p><p>For all its extra goodies, Nintendo seems to have severely overestimated how much Switch owners are actually willing to pay for the Expansion Pack service, launching on October 25, 2021. For it, Nintendo hiked up the cost to an eye-watering $49.99 / \u00a334.99 per year. Strangely, UK players are getting a somewhat better deal here, but it\u2019s still double the cost of the base subscription. US Switch owners will be paying roughly 2.5 times as much if they want to opt into the Expansion Pack service. Ouch.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Nintendo fans haven\u2019t taken this one lying down. The official Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack overview video, uploaded to the company\u2019s YouTube channel, has garnered over 89,000 dislikes at the time of writing. And the number of likes? Just 16,000. If I were Nintendo, I\u2019d be embarrassed, to say the least.</p> <div class=\"youtube-video\"><iframe data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fNsGXJ6Cl00\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> <h2 id=\"a-sugar-coated-online-experience-5\">A sugar-coated online experience</h2> <p>It\u2019s perhaps most insidious that Nintendo chose not to unveil Expansion Pack\u2019s price point when the feature was initially announced. That was during the September 23, 2021 Nintendo Direct, where fans were delighted to see N64 and Sega Genesis / Mega Drive games finally arrive on Switch. Of course, most of us expected (and were willing) to be paying a little more for this expanded service. The keyword there being \u201clittle.\u201d</p><p>Instead, Nintendo opted to quietly announce Expansion Pack\u2019s price during another anticipated showcase, that being the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Direct, detailing free updates and a paid expansion coming to the island life sim on November 5. If we weren\u2019t so intensely relaxed by Animal Crossing\u2019s wholesomeness, we\u2019d surely have been more incensed in the moment. It wasn\u2019t until just after that the reality set in.</p><p>But what really stings most here is that the benefits offered by the Expansion Pack are great. Fans have been clamoring to get N64 represented on the Switch since the launch of NSO, and tossing in Genesis / Mega Drive is a wonderful bonus. And we\u2019d like to hope both apps are updated with new titles on the regular, adding even more value to the service.</p><p>That\u2019s about where my compliments end, though. Having access to New Horizons\u2019 Happy Home Paradise DLC is nice, but it\u2019s arguably better value to just buy it outright for the asking price of $24.99 / \u00a322.49, which in itself is a little steep, but at least you\u2019ll own it. If, for whatever reason, you need to unsubscribe from Expansion Pack, you\u2019ll most likely lose access to the DLC.</p> <figure data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\"><img id=\"uADFzCtHNywQNybmj46dcU\" name=\"Animal Crossing New Horizons.jpg\" alt=\"cheap Nintendo Switch deals sales\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uADFzCtHNywQNybmj46dcU.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" ><span class=\"caption-text\">We hope you like Animal Crossing, because it's one of Expansion Pack's only redeeming features </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure> <h2 id=\"stacking-up-to-the-competition-5\">Stacking up to the competition</h2> <p>Yes, Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack is still slightly cheaper than the competition. <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/playstation-plus-free-games\">PS Plus</a> weighs in at $59.99 / \u00a349.99 for the year, while <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-game-pass-ultimate\">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> is much pricier at $15.99 / \u00a310.99 a month.</p><p>However, the latter makes certain that its premium service is worth the cost, bundling the incredible <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-games-pass\">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscription service with both <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-live-gold-deals\">Xbox Live Gold</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-cloud-gaming-gets-a-monumental-upgrade-and-is-now-available-on-ios-and-pc\">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> which allows you to play Game Pass titles on a device of your choice, including <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/best-android-phones\">Android phones</a> and tablets.</p><p>Throw in the fact that all first party Microsoft Game Studios titles land on Game Pass on day one, and you have a service on Xbox consoles that justifies its relatively higher cost.

    "full_description": "Mild spoilers for Invasion episodes 1-3 follow. Alien invasion movies and TV shows are a key cornerstone of the sci-fi genre. From Independence Day and District 9, to The X-Files and Falling Skies, audiences have grown accustomed to the film and TV industries churning out stories about aliens invading Earth. With so many comparable productions already available to viewers, how do studios and showrunners go about making an original alien invasion tale that audiences haven\u2019t seen before? For the creators of Invasion, Apple TV Plus\u2019 latest sci-fi show, the answer to this challenging question was two-fold: tell a story with a distinctly global appeal and ground it in the theme of human alienation. \u201cWe don\u2019t often see an alien invasion with a global cast; it\u2019s not canon in this genre,\u201d co-creator David Weil tells TechRadar. \u201cBut I think the series\u2019 message is that there\u2019s more that unites us than divides us, and I hope Invasion acts as a reflection on our global interconnectivity rather than people isolating themselves from one another.\u201d Ahead of Invasion\u2019s October 22 release, TechRadar sat down with Weil and the series\u2019 cast to discuss its exploration of human isolation. We also dig into the show\u2019s chief influences and the design process behind its unusual and spooky aliens. Set in the present day, Invasion tells the story of six individuals, spread across four continents, when a seemingly invisible alien species threatens the existence of humanity itself. Sam Neill (Jurassic Park) stars as US Sheriff Jim Bell Tyson, the first individual to realize that extraterrestrials have invaded Earth. Meanwhile, Golfshifteh Farahani (Extraction) and Firas Nassar (Fauda) play married couple Aneesha and Ahmed Malik, who embark on a roadtrip to cross the US-Canadian border to try and keep their children safe. Shamier Anderson (Awake) portrays US Navy Seal Trevante Ward, who encounters the aliens during a tour of Afghanistan, while Japanese Space Agency technician Misuki Yamato, played by Deadpool 2\u2019s Shioli Kutsuna, attempts to unravel the aliens\u2019 origins. Finally, Billy Barratt (A Christmas Carol) features as Caspar Morrow, a British national whose school trip is interrupted by the martians\u2019 attack. From the outset, Weil and co-creator Simon Kinberg (X-Men: Days of Future Past, Sherlock Holmes) wanted to develop a unique alien invasion tale. Even so, Weil admits that it was inevitable that Invasion would be influenced by similar stories \u2013 with one particularly iconic tale acting as a major reference point. \u201cI always wanted to adapt War of the Worlds,\u201d Weil says. \u201cAs a kid, I was so inspired by H.G. Wells\u2019 novel, and then by Orson Welles\u2019 1938 radio play. So I wanted to create a story that skirted reality and fiction, and that gave the same kind of experience to audiences that both individuals did for their time.\u201d Surprisingly, Weil and Kinberg both worked on CBS\u2019 2019 revival of The Twilight Zone, but it wasn't here that their paths crossed ahead of collaborating on Invasion. Instead, the duo were simultaneously working on separate alien invasion TV series \u2013 until Weil\u2019s agent suggested that they should join forces and work on a combined project. \u201cIt [our original meeting] was supposed to be an hour-long meeting,\u201d Weil explains. \u201cBut it turned into a seven-hour one! We pitched ideas back and forth, and talked about characters that we had in mind. It was this incredible dance of collating ideas, which led to us spending two years building and refining Invasion\u2019s story.\u201d No good alien invasion story is complete without its intimidating antagonists.

    "full_description": "Google has teamed up with Facebook to work around Apple's privacy tools in Safari to continue tracking end-users, an update to an antitrust lawsuit claims, with the search engine also doing what it could to slow down other regulatory initiatives surrounding privacy. A lawsuit was filed against Google in December 2020 by a group of attorneys general, accusing the search engine of \"engaging in market collusion to rig auctions,\" reports AppleInsider. While the lawsuit largely focuses on a deal between Google and Facebook to cooperate in the online advertising business instead of competing, an update accuses the two tech giants of trying to work against initiatives by Apple to help protect the privacy of its users. The amended complaint filed on October 22 and first reported by The Register, expands on the original claim in some directions, revealing more ways that Google may have tried to subvert user privacy. As part of the complaint, it is alleged Google and Facebook \"have been working together to improve Facebook's ability to recognise users using browsers with blocked cookies on Apple devices, and on Apple's Safari browser, thereby circumventing one Big Tech company's efforts to compete by offering users better privacy. This was apparently prompted by the two companies working closely and in integrating their SDKs \"so Google can pass Facebook data for user ID cookie matching,\" the complaint reads. \"They also coordinated with each other to harm publishers through the adoption of Unified Pricing rules,\" it added. Apple has implemented many privacy protection measures into its products, including Safari, such as 2018's Intelligent Tracking Protection 2.0. The system required websites to request tracking privileges from users on an opt-in basis with a culling of cookies 30 days after the user stops visiting relevant sites along with independent tracking of widgets and embeds. A privacy report in Safari for macOS Big Sur offered users' data on what trackers a website includes, as well as advising on how many trackers were prevented from profiling the user over 30 days. --IANS vc/khz (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

    "full_description": "Archaeologists say they have discovered hundreds of Mayan artifacts, including ceramic vessels and burial sites, along the route of a train construction project in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula . Researchers have so far discovered nearly 2,500 pre-Hispanic structures, 80 burial sites and thousands of vessels and fragments along the route of the \"Maya Train,\" Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) announced in a statement Thursday. The artifacts were discovered with the help of GPS georeferencing, satellite topographic images and LIDAR sensors in the periphery of just one of the sections of the project, which runs from the cities of Palenque, in Chiapas to Esc\u00e1rcega, in Campeche. Discoveries ranged from mounds to bases with complex architecture, INAH archaeologists Ileana Echauri P\u00e9rez and Iliana Ancona Arag\u00f3n said. The pair also worked with INAH investigator Silvianne Boucher Le Landais. \"Both the immovable archaeological artifacts and the movable ones expand the knowledge about daily life, and trade and cultural exchange relations that existed centuries ago in the Mayan area,\" the researchers said. Some objects \"of special interest\" for researchers include \"an offering composed of a bowl and a spout vessel, both with four mammiform supports -- representing the breasts of a woman,\" which date from the transition from Pre-Classic to Classic periods, known as Protoclassic, INAH said. Archaeologists believe the vessels were used by the ruling elite during \"important political or religious moments,\" and the pouring vessel was likely to have been used for precious liquids such as chocolate and perfumes. Preliminary analysis indicated the Maya had inhabited the area for a long time, from the Middle Preclassic Period -- which began in 700 BC -- to as late as 850 AD, the end of the Late Classic Period. Another area of interest for researchers is the Boca del Cerro area, located on the banks of the Usumacinta River, which was part of a large residential area associated with a key commercial hub that connected regions along the Usumacinta and other parts of Mesoamerica. \"The construction of the Mayan Train constitutes an important research opportunity, through archaeological recovery, with a view to expanding the knowledge about the archaeological sites of the regions that the train will travel through,\" researchers said. However, critics of the train project, which is intended to connect beach resorts and the peninsula's interior, say it will damage the environment and potentially harm other archeological sites. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has insisted that construction of the project, which will run through five states, will be conducted in a way that is safe for the environment and will benefit tourism.

    "full_description": "A new report suggests that the third generation Apple iPhone SE will have its design based on the iPhone XR. This would also suggest that the iPhone SE 3 could be the first iPhone to feature the bezel-less, notch-bearing design with FaceID instead of TouchID. Apple\u2019s iPhone SE series has been known to pick up older designs of the iPhone series and turn it into newer phones with modern processors. The iPhone SE second generation was based off the body of the iPhone 8 , which also happened to be the last non-SE iPhone to feature the big-bezel, TouchID style design. The iPhone XR was more affordable than the other iPhones it launched with and it still offers the modern design that devices like the iPhone SE second generation lack. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png The report also makes sense as the iPhone SE series is one of the few Apple lineups that still uses TouchID and a report from earlier this year suggested that the company is planning to move all of its devices, including the MacBooks to FaceID. The report from \u2018mydrivers.com\u2019 by no means could be a confirmation of the design or even the existence of a new iPhone SE. However, the clues do make sense if you consider the Cupertino-based company\u2019s past track record of recycling designs. We should have more leaks or official details of the phones as we head closer to spring 2022, which is when the phone could be expected to launch.",

    "full_description": "Obsbot Tiny MSRP $199.00 Score Details DT Recommended Product \u201cThe Obsbot Tiny is a unique webcam that could have benefitted from a larger sensor.\u201d Pros Subject tracking works well A.I.-driven pan, tilt, and zoom Noise-cancelling microphones Innovative gimbal design Cons Image quality suffers in low light Maximum resolution of 1080p Webcams have become an integral part of our lives \u2014 especially during the past year and a half \u2014 allowing us to collaborate and communicate from afar. While most webcams try to differentiate in terms of video and microphone quality, Obsbot is taking a radically different approach. Relying on the tried and proven 1080p video standard, the $199 Obsbot Tiny is a personal home webcam that infuses artificial intelligence smarts, a dual axis gimbal, and subject-tracking capabilities into a truly powerful solution that\u2019s typically found in larger, and oftentimes more expensive, conference room products. It promises to be a smart tool for creators, with more natural panning, tilting, and zooming capabilities that will make your videos appear dynamic. Jump to: Design | Performance and image quality | A.I. smarts | Our take Design In a space where most webcams haven\u2019t changed much over the years, Obsbot\u2019s take is a surprising breath of fresh air. Instead of relying on an unassuming single-piece enclosure that houses the image sensor and microphones and a stand that clips to most monitors, Obsbot instead gives the traditional design an extreme makeover. With the Obsbot Tiny, what you\u2019re getting is a cross between a a traditional webcam and a gimbal, like DJI\u2019s Osmo series. At a glance, the Obsbot\u2019s design, while refreshing, may seem a bit overkill. Monitors, after all, don\u2019t need the stabilization mechanism of a gimbal, as they\u2019re meant to be stationary pieces of technology, and most people aren\u2019t conducting important video calls from a loud train or a turbulent airplane. However, in this case, the gimbal isn\u2019t designed for stabilized video feeds, but rather for controlling the cam. The Tiny relies on artificial intelligence to drive the motor in the two-axis gimbal, allowing the cam to pan, tilt, and zoom (PTZ). This makes it one of the most \u2014 if not the most \u2014 compact PTZ desktop webcams on the market today, and the feature here rivals much bulkier and expensive videoconferencing equipment found in office conference rooms. In fact, this design makes the Obsbot Tiny resemble DJI\u2019s Pocket 4K with its handle chopped off. The Tiny comes with a magnetic base, allowing it to be attached to most metal surfaces, and a magnetic mounting clamp so it can attach to laptops and monitors with ease. Creators looking to use this on a tripod can also rely the threads on the bottom of the Tiny. Like many modern webcams, the Obsbot can record videos at FHD 1080p resolution, but the downside is that you\u2019re limited to 30 frames per second \u2014 other fps formats aren\u2019t supported. Digital zoom is supported, and the maximum zoom is 2x, which gives you some flexibility to pan and zoom for tighter shots if you\u2019re willing to sacrifice some image quality in the process. The camera has omnidirectional microphones with noise cancellation technology, which worked surprisingly well when we tested the unit at home and in a more quiet cafe during the afternoon. The gimbal allows the cam to pan up to 150 degrees around and tilt up or down up to 45 degrees, adding the flexibility to get the perfect shot if you\u2019re a creator looking to stream. A single USB cable is all that\u2019s needed to connect your desktop or laptop. Obsbot also included a DC port if your device doesn\u2019t output enough power to the Tiny. In our testing, we didn\u2019t need to resort to DC power on a variety of laptops from Apple, HP, and Lenovo. Performance and image quality It\u2019s easy to get excited about the Obsbot Tiny\u2019s advanced capabilities in a space that has only seen iterative improvements, but you\u2019ll have to really evaluate how you\u2019re conducting your video calls or streaming sessions before you invest in the Tiny. Most people, for example, will be sitting relatively stationary at their desk during video calls, so the PTZ features won\u2019t come into play at all. If you\u2019re prepared to convert your living room into a Shark Tank -like stage, complete with easels, a white board, and posters, then the Tiny will make sense. In this sense, the Tiny will make your home presentation look more like an Apple product announcement keynote, tracking you and your movement across your home \u201cstage\u201d to deliver a more dynamic video. For its tiny size, the Obsbot Tiny works really well \u2014 the noise canceling omnidirectional microphone\u2019s performance was solid. The party I was videoconferencing with noted that despite the background noise in a coffee shop, my voice was clean and clear, and distractions were minimized. Video quality, for the most part, was proficient. At 1080p FHD, it was definitely crisper and less grainy than the 720p HD camera on my 2016-era MacBook Pro . In general, I found image quality to be about on par with what\u2019s available on Windows laptops that have a 1080p webcam. That\u2019s not exactly a huge compliment, as laptop webcams are notorious for poor quality. Compared to a 4K webcam , like Dell\u2019s UltraSharp webcam or Logitech\u2019s highly rated Brio , the Obsbot Tiny\u2019s video quality is definitely not as sharp. If you\u2019re using the camera more for video recording \u2014 rather than streaming or videoconferencing \u2014 this shouldn\u2019t be a big issue, as most calling services cap the upload resolution to 1080p or less. The biggest drawback with such an advanced webcam like the Obsbot Tiny is that the image sensor is small . This means that the camera doesn\u2019t capture as much light as a larger camera, like a DSLR or mirrorless camera. In this case, this means that image quality quickly degrades in lower-light situations, and you\u2019ll notice more graininess in your videos if you\u2019re doing video calls in darker rooms. In brightly lit environments with adequate ambient lighting, this isn\u2019t a concern, so office calls will be fine, but gamers and streamers who play in darker rooms may want to look elsewhere for a streaming solution. Due to the lack of HDR video support, if you\u2019re sitting in front of a bright window, you\u2019ll notice some blown-out highlights and darker areas in the frame will lose a bit of detail In general, white balance also suffers in challenging conditions, and you\u2019ll find skin tones to be a little off when the camera is focused on your face. A.I. smarts A lot of the camera controls and settings can be manually tuned using software that can be installed on your PC. However, if you\u2019d rather not man the camera yourself, you can rely on artificial intelligence to get the job done. Like more advanced webcams, the Tiny can auto-track and auto-frame your subject, panning and tilting the camera to create a smooth video feed without choppy transitions. The feature works really well, though it may take a few seconds for the Obsbot Tiny to lock in and locate the subject. If you\u2019re not jogging from one end of the room to the other\u2013 think small, steady pacing on stage \u2014 then the camera will be able to track without issue. The camera did struggle a bit with faster-moving subjects, like a baby running across the room. Another A.I.-controlled element is gesture control. Rather than navigate the software or fiddle with the hardware, you can simply raise your hand, palm-side out with your fingers together, next to your face, and the camera will lock in on the target. The LED light strip on the base of the Obsbot Tiny will flash and indicate that it has locked on to you. Once the camera identifies whom to track, it will use A.I. to pan and swivel the camera to wherever you are in the room by using the motors in the gimbal. In use, the motor isn\u2019t loud at all, so that was a nice feature that minimized distracting background noise. If you need to zoom, you can hold your hand up next to your face and use your pointer finger and thumb to form an \u201cL\u201d shape. This will trigger the camera to zoom in 2x for a tighter crop around your face. If you\u2019re self recording a sales pitch or presentation, having a camera that can automatically pan, tilt, and zoom allows you to create a more compelling video. The best part is you don\u2019t even have to have a cameraperson to do the work. And though there isn\u2019t a dedicated privacy shutter on this camera, you can put the camera to sleep when you\u2019re done. With this mode, the Obsbot Tiny aims the lens downward to give you peace of mind that it isn\u2019t recording when it shouldn\u2019t be. The LED indicator strip will also indicate if the camera is in record mode. Our take The Obsbot Tiny delivers plenty of advanced A.I.-powered features in a compelling hardware package. Obsbot\u2019s Tiny webcam brings premium PTZ features more commonly found on larger conference room video solutions to an affordable package for home use. It\u2019s really only a good option for someone who needs that functionality, though, as the image quality isn\u2019t the best. Are there any alternatives? There are plenty of capable 1080p and 4K webcams . Inexpensive webcams start at well under $100, but generally, you get what you pay for. At $199, the Obsbot Tiny competes against more premium webcams, like Logitech\u2019s Brio. The Brio costs the same as the Tiny, but sacrifices the Obsbot\u2019s more advanced A.I. capabilities in favor of more advanced image quality. This means you\u2019ll get better 4K resolution on the Brio \u2014 compared to 1080p \u2014 and HDR support. How long will it last? The Obsbot Tiny has a standard one-year limited warranty, but webcams are designed to last for many years of use. Unlike smartphones, a webcam isn\u2019t a peripheral that\u2019s designed for annual or biennial upgrades, and the Obsbot can potentially last five years or even longer. Unless the hardware breaks \u2014 given the gimbal mechanism, the Obsbot Tiny may be more prone to failure than other competing webcams due to the number of moving parts \u2014 the device should last you for many years to come. Should you buy it? Yes, though it really depends on the features you need out of a webcam. If you\u2019re just using the Tiny for general video chats, then its advanced features may be overkill and you\u2019re better off getting something with better image quality. But if you\u2019re recording a sales pitch or a presentation, having an A.I.-powered cameraman makes it a unique tool.

    "full_description": "The Morrison government is set to usher in new social media laws aimed at protecting teen users and tightening privacy codes. Attorney-General Michaelia Cash on Monday revealed what she described as landmark legislation after releasing a draft bill to create a binding privacy code for social media companies. At the centre of the proposed Privacy Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Online Privacy and Other Measures) Bill are greater protections for young users in the wake of concerning evidence about the ill effects that social media can have on teens\u2019 mental health. Among the proposals is a requirement for social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram to take \u201call reasonable steps\u201d to verify a user\u2019s age. As well, parental permission will be required for users aged under 16 to sign up. The government pointed to evidence that the mental health of young people had deteriorated in recent years and was linked to social media. \u201cWhile some platforms have taken positive steps, many others continue to turn a blind eye to the harm to children when their personal information is misused,\u201d Ms Cash said. \u201cThis world-leading legislation will ensure that the interests of the child always come before the commercial interests of big tech companies.\u201d Researchers and politicians have become increasingly alarmed about the effects of social media on the mental health of children. A 2018 survey by the Headspace foundation found that 37 per cent of young people surveyed nominated social media as the reason their mental health had deteriorated. And in a leaked internal presentation, Instagram said: \u201cWe make body-image issues worse for one in three teenage girls\u201d. Facebook, which owns Instagram, has said in response that it would soon encourage teenagers to \u201ctake a break\u201d. The bill also proposes to hand more powers to the industry\u2019s regulator, the Australian Information Commissioner, and introduce new tougher penalties. It will set guidelines about how the personal information of young people is used and passed on to other companies. \u201cGiven the information we have seen emerging from social media companies in recent times, it is clear these companies need more oversight, not less,\u201d Senator Cash said. \u201cFor far too long personal data and privacy online has been treated in a substandard manner. \u201cUnderstandably, parents expect their children\u2019s personal information to be protected from those that would do them harm online.\u201d In a move that defies belief, an anti-vaxxer is hocking prosthetic arms for $1500 on Facebook to sidestep getting the jab. An eight-year-old reviewing everything from handguns to flamethrowers has begun to turn heads worldwide, amassing a giant following online. The former tradies behind one of Australia\u2019s most loved Instagram pages have revealed how they made the jump from hi-vis to influencer.",

    "content": "Denise Betsema (Pauwels Sauzen-Bingoal) mastered the sand dunes of Zonhoven to clinch her first World Cup win of the season at round four of the series. The Dutch rider was pushed all the way by world champion Lucinda Brand (Baloise Trek Lions) but used her skills to pull out a winning gap of 46 seconds. It was Betsema\u2019s second win during a warm weekend in Belgium after also soloing to victory at the Superprestige round in Ruddervoorde the previous day. Betsema took the World Cup lead off the hands of Marianne Vos who was absent due to taking a break in racing. Brand was a determined chaser but finished 46 seconds behind her Dutch rival in second. European champion Ceylin Alvarado (Alpecin-Fenix) worked her way back from a third row start to catch teammate Puck Pieterse on the final lap and pass the youngster to take third, 1:08 down on Betsema.Betsema took the World Cup lead off the hands of Marianne Vos who was absent due to taking a break in racing. It will be the first time the 28-year-old from Texel has worn the overall series leader\u2019s white jersey when the series continues next Sunday in Overijse. \"I'm very happy. The white jersey was never there for me so I'm really enjoying it for the next race. It is one of my favourite courses so to win here is so cool,\" Betsema said.\"It's a difficult course to recover from because the straights are really technical. So I had to go deep. But it is super nice to take the victory here. That was my goal for today.\"The form is good, so on to the European Championships.\"After placing fifth the previous day in the Superprestige round in Ruddervoorde, Brand was 'satisfied' to return to the podium with her second place. \"I'm definitely satisfied today,\" Brand added. \"If I look back at yesterday [in Ruddervoorde] I have to be happy just fighting for a podium. I had a good start which made it a bit easier for me today. \"That made sure I could find my rhythm. Denise was the best today and took advantage every lap, she deserved the win today.\" How it unfolded The UCI Cyclo-cross World Cup returned to Europe and Belgium on Sunday for the fourth round following the opening three races in America. Leading the way on the asphalt start was French rider H\u00e9lene Clauzel (AS Bike Crossteam) who led into the tight switchbacks which were taken quickly on a warm afternoon in Belgium. She was quickly overtaken and 19-year-old Puck Pieterse (Alpecin-Fenix) who used her skills on the difficult sandy terrain putting pressure on the front and stringing out the field on the opening lap. After missing the opening three World Cup rounds due to illness European Champion Alvarado started 19th on the grid and had to battle her way through the field. After winning the Superprestige round in Ruddervoorde the previous day, Betsema joined Pieterse and forced the second-lap pace with Brand just six seconds back. Meanwhile, Alvarado had used her mountain bike skills to ride one of the sandy climbs and moved herself back up into seventh but 30 seconds back. Betsema was keen to ride alone at the head of proceedings and powered up the steep climbs and gapped youngster Pieterse before the mid-way point. Brand kept her pace consistent in the chase behind and clawed herself back up to Pieterse by using her running skills to close the gap on the steep and sandy climbs 20 seconds behind the lone leader. Behind, Alvarado continued to work her way through the field pulling herself back to under-23 world champion Fem van Empel (Pauwels Sauzen-Bingoal) in fourth place. World champion Brand was too strong for her young rival Pieterse and pulled clear in second place continuing her pursuit of Betsema with three laps to go. Searching for her first World Cup win of the season and third in her career Betsema continued to master the sand dunes and pulled her gap out to 26 seconds ahead of lone chaser Brand. Further back, Alvarado was chasing a podium position, she had charged clear of Van Empel and was in pursuit of Pieterse. Taking the bell, Betsema had a 38-second advantage over Brand while Pieterse was just six seconds clear of a determined Alvarado in the battle for third. Alvarado used her mountain bike skills to fly down the 'De Kuil' sand dune descent and closed the gap to team-mate Pieterse. After running back up the sand dune Alvarado mounted her bike ahead of Pieterse before distance her young rival with an attack up the following climb. Betsema was the clear winner and had time to celebrate ahead of Brand while Alvarado snatched the final podium place from teammate Pieterse.

The white jersey was never there for me so I'm really enjoying it for the next race. It is one of my favourite courses so to win here is so cool,\" Betsema said. \"It's a difficult course to recover from because the straights are really technical. So I had to go deep. But it is super nice to take the victory here. That was my goal for today. \"The form is good, so on to the European Championships.\" After placing fifth the previous day in the Superprestige round in Ruddervoorde, Brand was 'satisfied' to return to the podium with her second place. \"I'm definitely satisfied today,\" Brand added. \"If I look back at yesterday [in Ruddervoorde] I have to be happy just fighting for a podium. I had a good start which made it a bit easier for me today. \"That made sure I could find my rhythm. Denise was the best today and took advantage every lap, she deserved the win today.\" How it unfolded The UCI Cyclo-cross World Cup returned to Europe and Belgium on Sunday for the fourth round following the opening three races in America. Leading the way on the asphalt start was French rider H\u00e9lene Clauzel (AS Bike Crossteam) who led into the tight switchbacks which were taken quickly on a warm afternoon in Belgium. She was quickly overtaken and 19-year-old Puck Pieterse (Alpecin-Fenix) who used her skills on the difficult sandy terrain putting pressure on the front and stringing out the field on the opening lap. After missing the opening three World Cup rounds due to illness European Champion Alvarado started 19th on the grid and had to battle her way through the field. After winning the Superprestige round in Ruddervoorde the previous day, Betsema joined Pieterse and forced the second-lap pace with Brand just six seconds back. Meanwhile, Alvarado had used her mountain bike skills to ride one of the sandy climbs and moved herself back up into seventh but 30 seconds back. Betsema was keen to ride alone at the head of proceedings and powered up the steep climbs and gapped youngster Pieterse before the mid-way point. Brand kept her pace consistent in the chase behind and clawed herself back up to Pieterse by using her running skills to close the gap on the steep and sandy climbs 20 seconds behind the lone leader. Behind, Alvarado continued to work her way through the field pulling herself back to under-23 world champion Fem van Empel (Pauwels Sauzen-Bingoal) in fourth place. World champion Brand was too strong for her young rival Pieterse and pulled clear in second place continuing her pursuit of Betsema with three laps to go. Searching for her first World Cup win of the season and third in her career Betsema continued to master the sand dunes and pulled her gap out to 26 seconds ahead of lone chaser Brand. Further back, Alvarado was chasing a podium position, she had charged clear of Van Empel and was in pursuit of Pieterse. Taking the bell, Betsema had a 38-second advantage over Brand while Pieterse was just six seconds clear of a determined Alvarado in the battle for third. Alvarado used her mountain bike skills to fly down the 'De Kuil' sand dune descent and closed the gap to team-mate Pieterse. After running back up the sand dune Alvarado mounted her bike ahead of Pieterse before distance her young rival with an attack up the following climb. Betsema was the clear winner and had time to celebrate ahead of Brand while Alvarado snatched the final podium place from teammate Pieterse.

The Verge confirmed the same by quoting Clubhouse CEO Paul Davison and global head of marketing Maya Watson who recently announced a new pinned links feature, which allows moderators to place outside links at the top of a room. Also read : Looking for a smartphone? Check Mobile Finder here . These links would direct listeners to whatever moderators want, including a news article, or a podcast. Certain links would not be allowed for security and moderation reasons, as per The Verge. Paul Davison did not name the types of links that would not be allowed, but he reportedly suggested links to 'OnlyFans' would fall in that category as links to porn or explicit content are banned. Anyone would be allowed to add, change, or remove a link, so long as they are a moderator of a room and regardless of the number of followers they have. As per The Verge, Clubhouse will not charge or take a cut of revenue from any transactions that occur through the link, although Paul Davison said the team \"would likely share news in the upcoming months about ways in which the app itself will monetize, like through ticketed rooms and subscriptions.\" The feature will roll out on October 27 for both iOS and Android.",

    "full_description": "Indian celebrities from the world of Bollywood and cricket are increasingly launching digital memorabilia through non-fungible tokens (NFT), hoping to rake in thousands of dollars by cashing in on growing interest in such assets. NFTs are a type of digital asset which use blockchain to record the ownership of items such as images, videos and other collectibles. Their roaring popularity has baffled many but the explosive growth shows no sign of abating. Bollywood superstars such as Amitabh Bachchan and Salman Khan are planning to launch NFTs soon. While Bachchan's NFTs will include autographed posters of his movies, Khan has been building excitement on his Twitter account by telling his 43 million followers about the planned NFT launch. Also read : Looking for a smartphone? Check Mobile Finder here . \"NFTs are right now alien to Bollywood but I am sure they (film stars) will see this as another platform where they can use their existing content and generate revenue,\" said Ayaan Agnihotri of Bollycoin, an NFT marketplace for Bollywood assets. Agnihotri said that within days of launch this month, his platform sold 8 million of the 20 million available so-called \"BollyCoins\", crypto tokens that can be used to buy NFTs when they are launched. One BollyCoin is worth 10 U.S. cents. But its still early days for celebrity NFTs in India. Indian cricketer Dinesh Karthik is auctioning a digital art reel from a cricket match where he hit a match-winning six on the last ball for around 5 ethereums, a digital currency, worth around $20,000. But he has yet to receive any bids. \"NFT has picked up a lot in the West in the last one year with now iconic moments from basketball being bought by fans digitally, which gave us the idea,\" Karthik told Reuters. Others have had success. One of India's top fashion designers, Manish Malhotra, recently sold NFTs of digital sketches of some of his most famous creations for $4,000 a piece. Malhotra's website shows one can purchase some of his bridal wear outfits at a lower price range of $2,500-$3,500. The rise of NFTs has baffled many who say it makes little sense to spend large sums of money on items that don't physically exist and can simply be viewed online. Still, global sales volumes of NFTs have galloped to $10.7 billion in the third quarter of 2021, making an eightfold increase from the previous quarter, data from market tracker DappRadar showed. Vishakha Singh, vice president for NFTs at Indian crypto exchange WazirX, said celebrity participation in the segment is set to create excitement in the space. This, she said, \"is great for the ecosystem. This will help us in garnering more awareness towards this new game-changing world of digital assets,\" Singh said.",

If built, the device could even advance technologies such as quantum computing. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-3759129-1'); }); Hawking radiation is one of the few hypothetically observable predictions arising when the two great pillars of modern theoretical physics \u2013 general relativity and quantum mechanics \u2013 bump into each other. At the event horizon of a black hole, quantum mechanics predicts the creation of photon pairs. One of the photons, which has negative energy, disappears into the black hole. The other, which has positive energy, escapes into outer space. This effect would cause black holes to emit radiation, giving them a measurable temperature \u2013 which would be theoretically revolutionary as it would suggest they had internal degrees of freedom. Unfortunately, the temperatures of all known black holes would be lower than that of the cosmic microwave background. The radiation emitted would be masked by the radiation absorbed and be unobservable. In 1981, however, William Unruh, of the University of British Columbia in Canada showed that several physical systems are mathematically identical to that which produces Hawking radiation and therefore the effect could be studied in the lab. Among these analogues are water waves, fibre-optic systems and Bose-Einstein condensates. Disputed claims \u201c[These analogues are] not going to get to the heart of any question having to do with quantum gravity because that\u2019s going beyond the regime one is exploring here,\u201d explains theoretical physicist Miles Blencowe of Dartmouth College in the US; \u201cbut there are still important questions with Hawking\u2019s calculation.

In the new work, Katayama proposes that one of the most eye-catching predictions of Hawking\u2019s theory, made in 1999 by Steven Corley of the University of Alberta in Canada and Ted Jacobsen of the University of Maryland in the US, could be tested in a superconducting electric circuit. The duo outlined the operation of a black hole laser that requires a black hole to have a \u201cwhite hole\u201d inside it. The inner horizon of this white hole reflects negative energy photons back towards the black hole horizon, where, unable to escape, they are reflected back. The energy of the photons grows ever more negative as it bounces between the horizons, causing the energy of the photons emitted into outer space to become ever more positive. \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that one of these could be realized in nature, but it is possible to generate these in analogues,\u201d says Blencowe. Indeed, the first such black hole analogue was produced in 2016 in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Entangled radiation In this latest work, Katuyama proposes using the Josephson effect, which allows a superconducting current to become quantized, to create a non-dispersive wavepacket called a soliton in a metamaterial resonator. The soliton itself behaves as a resonant cavity, with radiation in the soliton becoming quantum-mechanically entangled with radiation emitted from the soliton. This emitted radiation is the analogue of Hawking radiation.

In addition, this system, which is based on nanotechnology, has good controllability. Therefore, by controlling the circuit parameters, it is possible to bring the black hole from the classical domain to the quantum domain, so it may allow us to study the quantum pair creation of black holes and white holes from a vacuum.\u201d Blencowe agrees the system\u2019s sensitivity could aid the search for Hawking radiation: \u201cSystems very close to this have been realized: they\u2019re very important as very sensitive detectors of microwave photons and they\u2019re very important in superconducting quantum bits,\u201d he says; \u201cIf the proposals are realized it would be a very clean demonstration of the Hawking effect \u2013 the signal is relatively large and you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the noise so much.\u201d Moreover, he sees significant potential for technology transfer: \u201cQuantum computing is all about generating entanglement as a resource, so entangled microwave photons generated through these kinds of systems could be very useful,\u201d he suggests.

    "full_description": "Squid Game is the latest super hit series out of the Netflix stables and viewers around the world are hooked - the show which cost $21 million to make will reportedly generate $891.1 million in value, according to Bloomberg. With the series only gaining in popularity, hackers and malicious users are working overtime to take advantage of viewers and fans. After a security firm flagged an app on the Play Store that was being used to spread malware, Google has removed the app from the Play Store and users will have to remove the app from their devices. Read on to know more about how to keep your devices safe. The malware that is directed at fans of the popular Netflix series Squid Game was spotted by ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko, who studies malware at the security firm. The app, known as \u2018Squid Game Wallpaper 4K HD\u2019 was reportedly being used to spread the notorious Joker malware. We have covered the Joker malware before, this is not the first instance of an app infecting an app on the store, but it is the first time that it is being used to target viewers and fans of the new hit series. Also read : Looking for a smartphone? Check Mobile Finder here . Squid Game themed Android Joker 1) downloads and executes native lib 2) native lib downloads and executes apk payload Running this app on device might result in malicious ad-fraud and/or unwanted SMS subscription actions https://t.co/PTDtPlUkBy pic.twitter.com/AFs8gkEuab \u2014 Lukas Stefanko (@LukasStefanko) October 19, 2021 According to the researcher, the app could result in \u201cmalicious ad-fraud and/or unwanted SMS subscription actions\u201d. If this sounds like the modus operandi of the Joker malware, that is likely because they both function in the same manner. This means that users could not only be bombarded with advertisements but they might also be signed up for some premium services which will cost them a lot of money. While Google has now removed the app from the Play Store, Android users who have downloaded the app must immediately remove it from their device as their devices might be at risk. They must also remain alert about similar apps that appear in the future, and avoid apps that are not officially released by the original company, even if the app or game is being offered for free. As the researcher notes, over 200 apps with the same theme are currently available on the Play Store, and users must remain cautious about downloading these apps in order to keep their devices safe.",

    "description": "The PS2 GTA games are making a welcome comeback \u2013 and there's a very specific reason they're still so appealing in 2021.",
    "content": "<article> <p>No offense to the remaining games on 2021's release calendar, but the thing I'm most excited about playing on Christmas Day this year is Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Rockstar Games' <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/gta-trilogy-releases-in-november-will-launch-day-one-on-xbox-game-pass\">Definitive Edition</a> will offer quality-of-life improvements to all three of GTA's PS2 entries, including better aiming and reworked visuals, while retaining the original essence of GTA 3, Vice City and San Andreas. The art style is drawing some mixed responses, and I think they've got Tommy Vercetti's hair all wrong, but generally my first reaction is positive. </p><p>So, what <em>is</em> the essence of those PS2 games? Well, to be brutal, the first three 3D GTA entries were devoid of checkpoints, rife with difficulty spikes and weighed down by stiff driving and shooting controls, even for the time. To pick up and play now, they're a bumpy ride for anyone used to playing the far more comfortable GTA 5, which has better shooting, driving and pretty much everything else. That's why the Definitive Edition upgrade is so welcome. </p><p>But the PS2 GTA games were more about the <em>vibes </em>than anything else. Anyone who endured the tough moments of those games, or failed a mission multiple times over, persisted so they could see more of the world or the story \u2013 or get their hands on tastier weapons. Each game was an odyssey across a vibrant pastiche of an American city: first, present day New York, then '80s Miami, and finally early '90s California, including Los Angeles. </p><p>This part of GTA has never changed: Rockstar's games skewer parts of American culture, but clearly revere it at the same time. The thing that's different is that their ability to depict that city on-screen has improved dramatically since GTA 3 dropped in 2001, thanks to the evolution of gaming technology and a vast increase in people working on the games. They also take many years longer to make as a result. </p><p>Nostalgia aside, though, I have a very specific reason for wanting to revisit the older GTA games in 2021: people don't really make open world games like this any more. </p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/how-to/gta-5-cheats\">GTA 5 cheats</a></li><li>What we know about <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/gta-6-release-date-news-and-rumors-mapping-the-path-to-grand-theft-auto-6\">GTA 6</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-ps4-games\">Best PS4 games</a></li></ul> <h2 id=\"supply-and-demand-5\">Supply and demand</h2> <figure data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1650px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\"><img id=\"uKF5495Nbm2o6cxChRYaYm\" name=\"image003 (1).jpg\" alt=\"Grand Theft Auto Trilogy Vice City\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uKF5495Nbm2o6cxChRYaYm.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1650\" height=\"928\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" ><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Rockstar Games)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Yes, publishers definitely make open world games \u2013 we're drowning in gigantic games that take tens of hours to finish, with maps covered in icons and things to find, all of which can trace their origins back to GTA 3 in some way.</p><p>But what about games where you can steal cars and cause carnage, just for the sake of doing so? They're harder to find now. </p><p>The fun was the point of the PS2 entries in the series. Yeah, you had a ticking money meter \u2013 but it wasn't a game about making constant deliveries so you could afford fancier cars, or make a progression bar tick up. You saw a fancy car you liked, and you put it in your garage, meaning it now belonged to you. You started a fight with the cops because it was fun. You stole a tank, because, why wouldn't you?</p><p>That basic ethos \u2013 the player-generated chaos of the GTA games on PS2 \u2013 is weirdly better embodied by Breath of the Wild right now than it is by other sandbox games. Blockbuster developers kept giving us big maps and filling them with objectives and side quests, but many of them lost the point of why you were actually there. </p><p>Most open world games now are RPG-lite \u2013 whereas the simulation was sort of the point with GTA's first forays into 3D. Progression systems arguably shift too much focus away from purely having fun in this genre. This is why I want these games back in my hands this year, even if their fundamentals are old as hell. Let's stick a weapons cheat on and set fire to some FIB cars. </p><p>These early GTA games, and their virtual cities, are also still beautiful. The other reason these games still have value now is that their worlds are gorgeous \u2013 if you've trekked across Los Santos too many times in GTA Online, old Los Santos is still amazing to behold. I remember these cities like they're real places I love. </p><p>At the time, Rockstar got some criticism for having cruder character models than you'd see in other games \u2013 but I would argue that its caricatured art style has dated beautifully. Whether it will feel like <em>exactly</em> the same world after the new art pass in the Definitive Edition remains to be seen. It looks more different to the original than I expected it to be, and I'm weirdly attached to the specific way Los Santos' orange sky looked on PS2, and the exact shade of light blue that I expect from Vice City's water. </p><p>If it can approximate the way I <em>remember</em> GTA looking on PS2, that might be enough \u2013 but the Definitive Edition may be too radical a change for that. Either way, having an excuse to go back to these three cities is welcome: just because they're old, it doesn't mean they lack a specific atmosphere and identity as fictional locations. Rockstar was better at bringing these virtual places to life than any of its competitors. </p> <h2 id=\"publicity-tour-5\">Publicity tour</h2> <p>GTA is bigger now than it's ever been. Powered by GTA Online, GTA 5 has sold 150 million copies and counting \u2013 which is over 10 times the total GTA 3 sold. Everything that blockbuster games are right now were shaped by these games, even if developers didn't always learn the best lessons from them. </p><p>If you weren't there, it's hard to emphasize just how important GTA 3 was 20 years ago. It's not something you can really understand in retrospect if you came to the series with GTA 5 \u2013 the top-down 2D GTA and GTA 2 were more minor hits, popular in the UK but not dominant elsewhere. </p><p>In the PSone days, a 3D GTA was something I dreamed about, but would struggle to envision being done well. So many series failed to make that leap with the same consistency they had on earlier platforms. </p><p>The shock of GTA 3 when it landed in 2001 was how <em>complete</em> it felt. Liberty City \u2013 the highlights of New York boiled down into three massive islands \u2013 was far and away the most impressive location ever put in a game. I'd drive to the side of Portland, the game's first island, and just drink in the city sounds: the pedestrian dialogue, the trains going past, the radio stations, and the other ambient noises of what felt like a real place. </p><p>To see 3D games make that kind of leap overnight was extraordinary. It's not something you'll ever see in the same way again, as graphical fidelity has become more incremental with each new generation. At the time, it seemed like a magic trick.</p><p>But, truthfully, these games have become a bit too tricky to find in their optimal form, and slightly too annoying for the vast majority of people to enjoy in 2021. What they represent as genre trailblazers, though, is still important, embodying the raw, chaotic potential of sandbox games that arguably got a little lost down the line. </p><p>These games are important enough that they deserved special treatment.

    "description": "The DJI Ronin 4D is a new breed of cinema camera \u2013 here's what a director and filmmaker thought of its talents during a day of filming.",
    "content": "<article> <p>Over the past 15 years, DJI has become rather good at helping filmmakers shoot beautifully steady video. It's the world's biggest drone brand, and also makes useful little cameras like the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/dji-pocket-2\">DJI Pocket 2</a>. But what it hasn't yet done is take on the likes of Canon or Sony in ground-based professional cameras. You saw it coming though, didn\u2019t you? The Ronin 4D is where this changes.</p><p>The Ronin 4D is mid-range professional cinema camera, with an interchangeable lens system and 4-axis stabilization, that has the oft-used 'game-changer' label written all over it. Given that it\u2019s been co-developed with some of the world\u2019s leading cinematographers, it looks and sounds like something that filmmakers should be excited about. As a writer and director, that includes me. </p><p>Luckily, I was recently given the chance to take the 6K version of DJI's new full-frame toy for a spin. And after a day's filming, I'm convinced it's going to be big deal for filmmakers and low-budget productions. Here's why it's the Hollywood Steadicam for (nearly) everyone.</p> <ul><li>These are the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/best-video-camera\">best video cameras</a> you can buy right now</li></ul> <h2 id=\"swanning-around-5\">Swanning around</h2> <p>It\u2019s important to say this upfront; out of the box, there is nothing like the DJI Ronin 4D. Nothing. It\u2019s squarish body is somewhat comparable to cameras like a RED or an Arri Alexa, but it\u2019s the floating arm that holds the sensor and bounces up and down in front that gives it a unique, black swan-like appearance.

    "full_description": "Over the past 15 years, DJI has become rather good at helping filmmakers shoot beautifully steady video. It's the world's biggest drone brand, and also makes useful little cameras like the DJI Pocket 2 . But what it hasn't yet done is take on the likes of Canon or Sony in ground-based professional cameras. You saw it coming though, didn\u2019t you? The Ronin 4D is where this changes. The Ronin 4D is mid-range professional cinema camera, with an interchangeable lens system and 4-axis stabilization, that has the oft-used 'game-changer' label written all over it. Given that it\u2019s been co-developed with some of the world\u2019s leading cinematographers, it looks and sounds like something that filmmakers should be excited about. As a writer and director, that includes me. Luckily, I was recently given the chance to take the 6K version of DJI's new full-frame toy for a spin. And after a day's filming, I'm convinced it's going to be big deal for filmmakers and low-budget productions. Here's why it's the Hollywood Steadicam for (nearly) everyone. It\u2019s important to say this upfront; out of the box, there is nothing like the DJI Ronin 4D. Nothing. It\u2019s squarish body is somewhat comparable to cameras like a RED or an Arri Alexa, but it\u2019s the floating arm that holds the sensor and bounces up and down in front that gives it a unique, black swan-like appearance. It really is something to behold. As a writer, director and only part-time camera-op, I instantly knew that to get the most out of this thing, I was going to have to enlist the help of DOP (Director of Photography) extraordinaire, Ciaran O\u2019Brien (look him up, he\u2019s a genius). Like any cinematographer, Ciaran is always keen to get his hands on new tech and jumped at the chance. A man of few (but very considered words), he \u201cooh-ed\u201d and \u201cahh-ed\u201d the first time he saw the Ronin 4D, which goes some way to tell you just how different this thing is. For operators who spend their days using heavy, cumbersome stabilizing equipment, this is a total no-brainer; it could potentially save a lot of back pain in the film industry. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, part of me thinks the design of the 4D is going to split opinion. Some are going to love its new take on camera design and the implementation of the stabilization tech. Others are simply not going to entertain it. They\u2019ll see it as a gimmick and will be happy to stick with their Canons, REDs and Arris. The ergonomics are initially unusual, but once you use the thing for more than five minutes, they make total sense. This is a camera that\u2019s primarily designed to be held. You can bolt two multi-functional 'grips' onto either side of the body and position it in front of you. You operate it at chest or midriff height, as opposed to on the shoulder, like almost every other camera in this category. For operators that spend their days using heavy, cumbersome stabilizing equipment, this seems like a total no-brainer; it could potentially save a lot of back pain in the film industry.

The headline feature of the Ronin 4D is exactly what the '4D' refers to, and that's the stabilization of the Z-axis.

When I watched Ciaran O\u2019Brien use it for the first time, I was astounded at the footage that we watched back. But he\u2019s being doing stuff like this for a long time and knows how to move with a stabilized camera; and this is an important point. The Ronin 4D isn\u2019t something that anyone can pick up and use to create a Michael Bay-esque action sequence (you should always focus on story and character in the first place, anyway). There\u2019s still an element of know-how and skill to get the most out of it. Take focusing, for example; focusing with a camera that\u2019s moving at pace is an art form in itself, and it\u2019s something that, on any professional shoot, would be taken to a dedicated person in the camera department. In my hands, the footage wasn\u2019t nearly as good \u2013 and I\u2019ve been using cameras for nearly 15 years now.

What I will say, though, is that the 4D still upped my game in terms of the footage I was able to get, and I throughly enjoyed the operating experience. Another big Ronin 4D feature is the LiDAR autofocus, which is essentially a laser-guided focus tracking system. Our tests found it to be good, but not perfect. It did seem like a step forward in terms of the various autofocusing systems that are out there, and it\u2019s almost certainly something that you\u2019re going to rely on if you\u2019re operating without a dedicated focus-puller. Especially if your manual focusing skills are as average as mine. But we\u2019re still not in a world where professional DOP\u2019s are going to trust an electronic system for focus. The reason being, any drop in focus on a big production could cost you a lot of money and annoy a lot of the cast and crew. The final thing worth mentioning is the Ronin 4D's wireless monitoring system, which will come at an additional cost. It\u2019s brilliant. It\u2019s simple to set up and it just works.

The 8K version is naturally a bit pricier at $11,499 / \u00a39,499 / AU$16,399 \u2013 it might not sound like a bargain, but this still represents good value for money in my eyes. Though I\u2019d be happy to bin the extra resolution and use the money saved to buy some add-ons like the XLR expansion plate, a few more batteries and some memory cards. DJI has produced something that will make grab attention and challenge the likes of Sony and Canon, who currently own the entry-level cinema camera marketplace. What was once only available to productions with five, six or seven-figure budgets, is now accessible to budding filmmakers and low-budget productions. The 4D\u2019s implementation of Z-axis stabilization technology, as well as the imagery, ergonomics and user experience is genuinely brilliant. It makes you rethink what\u2019s possible in terms of the shots that you can achieve, and I can\u2019t wait to see what young, hungry and more creative people than me do with it.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The Commonwealth Climate and Law Initiative (CCLI) has just published \u201c Fiduciary Duties and Climate Change in the United States \u201d by Sarah Barker, Cynthia Williams, and Alex Cooper. This is an extremely important report for reasons I will explain. The CCLI is a UK-based NGO which works with leading academic institutions (e.g., the University of Oxford), corporate law firms (e.g., MinterEllison), and civil society organizations (e.g., ClientEarth). The focus of the CCLI is to analyze board directors\u2019 legal obligations regarding climate change and to disseminate its findings in order to increase directors\u2019 understanding and to improve their ability to fulfill their fiduciary duty. The CCLI and its partners have previously published papers based on company law for Australia, Canada, India, Japan, Singapore, and South Africa. Working with the Climate Governance Initiative , a project launched in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, the CCLI has also published a Primer covering 21 jurisdictions. Ellie Mulholland, Director of the CCLI, explained: \u201cIn every jurisdiction that our legal experts looked at, they came to the same view: boards must rethink their legal duties in light of climate change. But there was still this nagging misconception that this wouldn't apply to the US, that a Delaware director could never be sued for what they do or don't do about climate change. This report should put that misconception to rest.\u201d Ellie Mulholland, Director of the Commonwealth Climate and Law Initiative Climate Commonwealth and Law Initiative In nearly every country in the world, the fiduciary duty of the company\u2019s board of directors is to the company. That means the board is responsible for ensuring that management takes decisions in the best interest of the company, i.e., not for itself or for shareholders seeking a short-term financial benefit that will damage the long-term prospects of the company. Of course, looking out for the best interest of the company means engaging with shareholders and responding to their concerns. This is a complex task because shareholders are not a homogenous group. Their time frames vary, as do their views on what contributes to value creation. The situation is more nuanced in the U.S.. Delaware law, which applies to the majority of large U.S. corporations since they are incorporated in Delaware, states that the board\u2019s duty is to the company and its shareholders. Over time, law has morphed into ideology with the doctrine that directors must put shareholders\u2019 interests first and only. Those especially enamored of this view decry \u201cstakeholder capitalism\u201d as some kind of left-wing desire to transfer money from shareholders to stakeholders. Yet Delaware law by no means precludes directors from taking account of the interests of stakeholders like employees, customers, suppliers, and the communities in which the company does business if this is in the long-term interest of shareholders. As Mr. Leo E. Strine, Jr., former Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court and now Of Counsel at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, who reviewed the report, put it: \u201cThe law rubs up against companies when companies rub up against stakeholders and society, and Employee, Environmental, Social and Governance (EESG) properly conceived is about the same subject: how a company can thrive while respecting the stakeholders and communities its operations affect.\u201d Leo E. Strine, Jr. Former Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court, Of Counsel at Wachtell, ... [+] Lipton, Rosen, & Katz Leo E. Strine, Jr. MORE FOR YOU Is Carbon Capture Another Fossil Fuel Industry Con? Sustainable Fashion Wants Brands To Redefine Business Growth Trouble With Predicting Future Of Transportation Is That Today Gets In The Way One of the issues in which the confounding of law and ideology is especially problematic in the U.S. concerns climate change. Despite clear mainstream market recognition \u2013 from the SEC to BlackRock \u2013 that climate change presents material financial risks (and opportunities) across the vast majority of U.S. industries, the view that it is an ethical or public policy issue that has nothing to do with the fiduciary duty of the board has remained stubbornly entrenched. This view couldn\u2019t be more wrong as brilliantly and definitively made clear in this report. The Corporate Secretary and General Counsel of every U.S. company should read this report very carefully. Since they are lawyers, they will be able to do so. Those of us who are not lawyers will find it rather heavy reading. Even the executive summary is 11 pages long. Ah, the way lawyers write \u270d\ufe0f! So let me boil this down for those who care about fiduciary duty and climate change but don\u2019t have the time to read this carefully argued and written report. The report is grounded in the fact that \u201cThe links between climate change and financial and systemic risks are increasingly evident and inextricable.\u201d Climate change poses material risks for both the real economy and financial system over short-, medium-, and long-term horizons. There are three categories of risks: 1. Physical Risks : These are due to more frequent and intense extreme weather events such as flooding, droughts, and storms that damage assets, interrupt production and supply chains, and compromise worker health, giving rise to breaches of contract, workplace, and environmental laws. 2. Economic Transition Risks : The transition to a net-zero emissions economy will result (and has already resulted) in changes in policy and regulations, technological and business model obsolescence, changes in investor preferences, and shifts in preferences of stakeholders such as employees and customers. 3. Litigation and Liability Risks : These are numerous and can come either from the attribution of a company\u2019s activities to climate change or from the company\u2019s failure to properly manage the physical and economic transition risks, thereby destroying shareholder value. Companies will be (and have already been) subject to litigation based on tort law, securities fraud laws, consumer protection laws, greenhouse gas emission laws, occupational health and safety laws, and human rights laws and norms. It is the responsibility of the board of directors to ensure that the company has the appropriate capabilities, strategy, capital allocation process, compliance programs, target setting, external reporting, and shareholder engagement processes to ensure that the company\u2019s physical and transition risks do not lead to litigation risk. And, to make this personal, failure \u201ccould serve as the basis for liability of individual directors or officers for breach of their fiduciary duties.\u201d Not to boast, but I think the U.S. is the World Champion when it comes to litigation, so directors have personal as well as professional reasons to take heed. No, I\u2019m not being a hysterical Climate Cassandra. Consider the two core issues of fiduciary duty based on company law, for which climate change is just one specific example: duty of loyalty and duty of care. Duty of Loyalty \u201cThe duty of loyalty includes a duty for directors to monitor (at least) their company\u2019s compliance with relevant legal obligations.\u201d Directors can fail here in two ways: (1) through an utter failure to properly implement any reporting information system or controls and (2) when such a system has been implemented, they have consciously failed to monitor it in the vain Sergeant Schultz hope of \u201c I know nothing .\u201d Or, in more formal legalistic language, \u201cthus disabling themselves from being informed of risks or problems requiring their attention, including missing the presence of or failing to act on \u2018red flags\u2019.\u201d The report also invokes the landmark Delaware Supreme Court 2019 Marchand decision which held that \u201cdirectors and officers should be alert to less strong warnings (\u2018yellow flags\u2019) when those warnings are made regarding mission-critical issues. Climate is already mission critical for many industries today and will become more so as the Earth warms up. Duty of Care \u201cThe normative duty of care requires directors and officers to make lawful, reasonably informed decisions. The duty is concerned with the robustness of the process of information gathering and deliberation, rather than a retrospective assessment of whether a \u2018correct\u2019 commercial decision was made or an optimum financial outcome achieved.\u201d This might sound like \u201cNo matter how stupid the directors are, if they try the best they can and blow it, it\u2019s okay. They\u2019ll get a participation medal.\u201d So, directors really have nothing to worry about if they can make an argument that a credible process was in place? Not so fast. The report also notes that shareholders \u201cmay access a corporation\u2019s books and records, including board materials and e-mails, and could these use those documents to bring these types of fiduciary duty claims.\u201d What this says to me is that going through the motions won\u2019t be good enough. Boards need to try really hard to get it right on climate change. And this is something admittedly very hard to do on this complex topic along so many different scientific, regulatory, and capital market dimensions. The report makes very clear that there can be director and officer liability exposure if the board fails to adequately ensure that the company is managing the risks associated with climate change. The pyramid figure below illustrates the hierarchy of good governance, from low risk for best practice at the top, down to abject failures at the bottom where the risk of liability is much more acute. Hierarchy of Personal Exposure for U.S. Directors on Climate Issues The Commonwealth Climate and Law Initiative Not only does the report persuasively make the case that poor governance of climate change could lead to liability under Delaware law, but it also makes some very useful recommendations for what good climate risk governance looks like in the form of 15 questions every board should be asking itself. These can be roughly categorized into: (1) understanding the many risks and the company\u2019s exposure to them, (2) ensuring that the company has a clear strategy and capital allocation process to survive in a net-zero economy, (3) reflecting the effects of climate change in the company\u2019s financial statements, (4) reporting on how the company is managing climate change and the transition, including targets and metrics for these targets, and (5) having the right governance structure and compensation policies in place for both management and the board. The Climate Commonwealth Climate and Law Initiative Logo The Commonwealth Climate and Law Initiative This report went through many drafts. In doing so, the CCLI received excellent and detailed feedback from a number of leading academic and practicing lawyers who are acknowledged in the report. Directors who ignore its findings and recommendations will not be fulfilling their fiduciary duties. They will also be risking their own reputations, positions on boards, and personal finances.",

The game allows players to do pretty much anything that they want to do, with the exception of changing the game\u2019s bedrock, or the borders of the game inside which all the players build and play. Now, a gamer has reportedly managed to dig and mine from the Nether ceiling, marking a first for any player in this game. According to a report by GameRant, it appears that a player has managed to dig up and mine the Bedrock blocks on the popular game, by using a special trick to mine the rock. Many Minecraft users do not know that breaking the Nether ceiling is possible, but those that have tried are aware that it is nearly indestructible, making it very difficult for a player to mine it -- until now. Also read: Looking for a smartphone? Check Mobile Finder here . The Minecraft gamer showed the process of removing the Bedrock blocks from the Nether ceiling in the game in a time lapse. The Minecraft gamer took to Reddit to explain the process of breaking down the Bedrock blocks that make up the Nether ceiling in the game. The gamer, who goes by u/Gneiss-name on Reddit, used pistons and redstone arranged strategically in order to break down the blocks in the game, according to the report . After a tedious eight hours, removing each block one by one, the gamer had managed to clear out over 1,400 bedrock blocks from the Nether ceiling in the game. It is important to remember that there is still no official method of removing bedrock in the game and the method used by the gamer has circumvented a safety feature used to protect gamers from digging out of the set world and into the Nether. However, according to the gamer, the blogger goal is the creation of a massive base in the Nether. It will be interesting to see how the Nether base plays out if the gamer is able to create their base in the area cleared by them, at some point in the future.",

But soon, plastic pollution may take on another meaning, as a new report forecasts that the industry\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions in the US will outpace those of coal by the end of the decade. Further Reading One of the most remote islands is plagued by plastic waste \u201cUnlike the plastic trash choking our waterways and littering our communities, the plastic industry\u2019s devastating impact on our climate is taking place under the radar, with little public scrutiny and even less government accountability,\u201d Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics and a former EPA regional administrator, said in the report . Plastic is a large but often overlooked source of carbon pollution. Production in the US creates at least 232 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, according to the report by Bennington College and the nonprofit organization Beyond Plastics. Plastic production is expected to emit another 55 million tons by 2025 if the 42 plants currently planned or under construction come online. Last year, coal power in the US produced 786 million metric tons of CO 2 , an amount that is expected to decline as coal-fired power plants are outcompeted by natural gas, solar, and wind. Between 2019 and 2020, carbon pollution attributed to coal dropped by 166 million tons. As coal continues its decline and plastic rises, it\u2019s inevitable that the two lines will cross. Today, carbon pollution from other parts of the economy exceeds that of plastics. But as other sectors are decarbonized, the industry\u2019s continued emissions growth undermines President Joe Biden\u2019s goal to reach net-zero carbon pollution by 2050. Advertisement Myriad sources A significant portion of plastics\u2019 carbon pollution comes from fracking and transporting gases used in production. One of those is methane, a potent greenhouse gas that warms the atmosphere 86 times more than the same amount of CO 2 over 20 years. Leaks at wellheads and along pipelines create 36 million tons of carbon pollution, the report says. Other parts of natural gas, like ethane, are used as feedstocks, and cracking them creates another 70 million tons. Other plastics feedstocks like coal and ammonia produce an additional 28 million tons. The pollution continues as plastics reach the end of their lives. Burning plastic waste is responsible for 15 million tons of carbon pollution. Even so-called \u201cchemical recycling,\u201d which typically uses high heat to melt plastics into component parts, could add another 18 million tons by 2025, the report says. Further Reading \u201cBlue\u201d hydrogen is worse for the climate than coal, study says The Plastics Industry Association said the report ignores some benefits of plastics that could offset some production-related pollution. \u201cPlastic is lighter and more durable than alternatives and reduces the overall weight of products. Lighter products require less fuel to transport,\u201d a spokesperson told E&E News. \u201cIf plastic packaging were replaced with other materials, waste and energy consumption would double, and weight and costs would quadruple,\u201d the spokesperson said. The American Chemistry Council, a trade association for American chemical companies, claims that alternatives to plastic packaging would have carbon footprints 2.7 times larger. The results of the new report jibe with a previous effort by the Center for International Environmental Law, which found that by 2050, carbon pollution from plastics could top 2.5 billion metric tons worldwide, more than double today. Plastic production facilities also tend to be concentrated near communities that disproportionately bear the brunt of the pollution. \u201cMore than 90% of the climate pollution that the plastics industry reports to EPA occurs in 18 communities, mostly along the coastlines of Texas and Louisiana,\u201d the new report\u2019s authors note. \u201cPeople living within 3 miles of these petrochemical clusters earn 28% less than the average US household and are 67% more likely to be people of color.\u201d",

    "full_description": "Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro line is seeing another regeneration, with the introduction of the MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021) and the MacBook Pro 16-inch (2021) , and the return of certain ports and a refreshed design is already making a lot of users excited. However, for some it felt like a battle to get to this point. For the past five years various MacBooks have come with the TouchBar , which is an OLED strip above the keyboard that replaced the F1 keys. They didn\u2019t strike a chord with users, with many opting to go for MacBooks that had a Function Row, which is the row of F1 keys, instead. But with the new MacBook Pro models, the TouchBar is no more with Apple seemingly acknowledging that it wasn\u2019t what pros wanted. While we await the new models and macOS 12 Monterey , let\u2019s look back at how the TouchBar missed the mark. Back in 2016 the MacBook line was in flux. USB-C was slowly replacing the ports in each product, which began with the MacBook 12-inch (2015) , which came with only one USB-C port. A year later, the MacBook Pro 15-inch (2016) arrived with the TouchBar. While it was a surprise to see the Function Row be replaced by an OLED strip, there was hope that developers would be able to take full advantage of what the TouchBar could offer. Apple would tout the benefits of how it would change depending on the app you were using, so you could access your bookmarks in Safari, or scrub a timeline when watching a film. As the years passed, however, Apple didn\u2019t improve upon the OLED bar. While the Escape key made a return with the MacBook Pro 16-inch (2019) , the software and hardware side of the TouchBar never improved past its 2016 unveiling. Small hopes of it gaining tactile feedback similar to the Haptic Touch of the iPhones never came to fruition. Also, while the TouchBar arrived on other MacBook Pro models, it never came to the keyboards or the MacBook Air. It was a missed opportunity for Apple. There was a potential to finally be rid of the F1 row and replace it with a TouchBar that would offer contextualised buttons that would change to the users\u2019 needs. Tools such as BetterTouchTool would give users the ability to customize it to their liking, but the benefits only went so far. Users even managed to run DOOM on the TouchBar, just because. But after five years, Apple has conceded that the Function Row needed to come back. Alongside the updates that the new MacBook Pro models bring, this is going to be a talking point as big as the notch . At Apple\u2019s Unleashed event, the company mentioned that \u201cThe Function Row was coming back to bring back the familiar tactile feel of mechanical keys that pros love.\u201d After my MacBook Air (2013) died a death after the SSD failed, I\u2019ve been waiting for a MacBook to take full advantage of Apple\u2019s Silicon hardware, beyond the M1 MacBook Pro 13-inch (2020) .

    "full_description": "Those talented folk at Hero Collector \u2014 the same people who make all those incredible models of sci-fi spacecraft \u2014 have launched a brand new \"Battlestar Galactica\" compendium that focuses purely on the conceptual artwork used to create the amazing spacecraft seen in both the original and the reimagined series. Available to pre-order now for $34.95 at Amazon, \" Battlestar Galactica: Designing Spaceships \" takes a deep dive behind the scenes on two generations of the classic science fiction series and tells the story of how visual effects pioneers created the iconic spacecraft for the original Universal Pictures show \" Battlestar Galactica \" in 1978 and how a digital revolution saw those designs interpreted for Ronald D. Moore's reimagined series in 2003. You can also pre-order it directly from Hero Collector here for \u00a320.99 (about $29 USD) and save \u00a37 off its normal \u00a327.99 price. This book, contains 202 pages of incredible artwork, including original designs by Eric Chu, Andrew Probert and Ralph McQuarrie. Accompanying the amazing illustrations is information about the designs and interviews with many of the people responsible. Needless to say, the book's author, Mark Wright, is a big fan of \"Battlestar Galactica.\" Battlestar Galactica: Designing Spaceships (Hero Collector): $34.95 at Amazon \"Growing up, I was a sucker for anything with spaceships and ray guns and the Galactica, the original series Galactica, is one of the finest screen starships of all time. Oh yeah, I put that up there with the Enterprise, the Liberator from 'Blake's 7' and the Eagle transporter from 'Space: 1999' \u2014 they're all up there,\" he told Space.com. Some of the very finest conceptual artwork ever seen comes from ideas for sci-fi films; all you have to do is look at the work of Syd Mead and Rob Cobb, the legendary artists behind many, if not most, of the iconic production designs seen in \"Blade Runner,\" \"Alien\" and \"Aliens,\" \"Robot Jox,\" \"Back to the Future\" and many more movies. And now for the first time, the artwork associated with \"Battlestar Galactica\" has been gathered together and published for fans of the show to enjoy. \"From McQuarrie\u2019s design of the original Galactica and its Cylon counterparts, to the digitally rendered, more modern equivalents, we've uncovered the stories behind their creation, inside and out. And we've attempted to be as extensive as possible, although sadly there are inevitably omissions where concept art and CG renders have been lost to the years and fast-moving TV production schedules,\" Wright said. Related: Real-Life Astronaut Dishes on 'Battlestar Galactica' Tragically, so many of these great artists are no longer with us. McQuarrie passed in March 2012, Mead in September 2019 and Cobb in September 2020. With changing technology, it means this method of production design is something we will see considerably less of in the future. For example, the book also contains designs from the excellent prequel mini-series \"Blood & Chrome.\" This is set before the events in the reimagined show, during the very first Cylon War and focuses on a then-young Viper pilot named Lt. William Adama, callsign Husker, (played by Luke Pasqualino). It's only 90 minutes long in total and was first shown as a webcast in 2012. However, since it had a considerably smaller budget than the four-season long 2004 show, improvisation was required and CGI was used much more extensively. This also meant that the production design, which required backward engineering from both the Colonial Viper Mk II and the Cylon Raider \u2014 from the 2004 show \u2014 in order to produce earlier incarnations, was all done by computer. \"There was no detail because all the foundations were done on the re-imagined series by the time they'd got to 'Blood & Chrome' and so that chapter's a little bit different in the book. Thank God for Doug Drexler [computer graphics supervisor] who was there on the ground working on that show and was able to give us some commentary on these ships. I'd say that's more of a commentary chapter because it was produced so differently to even the re-imagined series. That leap in digital VFX techniques by that stage is immense,\" Wright said. In addition to containing stunning artwork and never-before-seen illustrations, Wright has spoken to and interviewed some of the talented minds who worked on \"Battlestar Galactica\" including Jose Perez, Pierre Drolet, Ray Lai and Richard Livingston. \"In the production of this book, we have been granted invaluable insight from the concept and storyboard artists, CG supervisors, digital model makers, and art directors that brought these ships to the screen,\" Wright said. One of his favorite chapters is the one that covers the Blackbird. This was a totally new idea to the existing BSG universe and the story of its creation is told in the epic episode \"Flight of the Phoenix\" (S02, E09). Frustrated at the dwindling number of available Vipers due to loss, battle damage and wear-and-tear, Chief Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) begins to build a new fighter from scratch. At first, his idea is laughed at, but as the struggle of day-to-day life on the Galactica continues, many see the project as a creative outlet, providing a sense of purpose and something positive to distract their minds from the bleakness of their situation. However, the already short supply of replacement parts means some imaginative solutions have to be implemented and once the airframe is finished, Tyrol wonders where he will find enough metal to make the plane's skin. That is, until Lt. Agathon (Tahmoh Penikett) suggests using a carbon composite instead, a material that as yet, isn't in short supply onboard the Battlestar. And so the very first \"Colonial stealth fighter\" is constructed in one of the very best episodes of \"Battlestar Galactica.\" \"Oh yeah, I love that chapter,\" Wright laughs. \"I love it because the Blackbird was, basically, created by the art department, rather that the effects team. It was built physically, from scratch rather than being designed first. I love how there's lots of little sketches, showing different elements of its construction that were drawn as they went along. And that we were able to cover this in so much detail in the book, is great.\" \"Battlestar Galactica: Designing Spaceships\" is available to pre-order now for $34.95 at Amazon.

    "full_description": "Black Friday is always a great time to pick up a pair of headphones or earbuds at a discount - especially if you\u2019re on the hunt for some AirPods, which can be pricey at other times of the year. Now that the AirPods 3 have been announced, there are more AirPods to choose from this year - and a new lower price for the AirPods 2 means that 2021\u2019s AirPods Black Friday deals are set to be better than ever before. In fact, we\u2019ve already seen the AirPods 2 with the wireless charging case crash to an all-time-low price in the US- and the deals are only set to get better in the run up to November 26. While the AirPods 2 may be the best budget option this Black Friday, they aren\u2019t necessarily the best AirPods you can buy. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve put together this handy guide to all the different AirPods models, to help you make the right decision when the sales hit. The AirPods Pro are the best AirPods you can buy in 2021 - and they're sure to be discounted this Black Friday now that the AirPods 3 have been launched. While the AirPods Max have superior sound and the AirPods 2 are cheaper, the AirPods Pro are the best all-rounders, and they come with active noise cancellation to help you block out the world around you. We've previously seen a record-low price in the US of $169, and \u00a3169 in the UK - so if you see discounts like this you can be sure you're onto a great deal. It's entirely possible that prices will drop even further, making them cheaper than the new AirPods 3 ($179 / \u00a3169), which don't come with active noise cancellation. There are also rumors that the AirPods Pro 2 are on the horizon, which could drive prices down even further - we'd be surprised to see anything cheaper than $170 / \u00a3160, though, unless you opt for a refurbished pair. , a sales price that proved popular over the Black Friday period meanwhile, the UK has seen prices drop to \u00a3169 in the past. Read more: Apple AirPods Pro review The AirPods Max are hands-down the best-sounding AirPods you can buy - and they even have a place among the best wireless headphones on the planet thanks to their stellar audio performance. They boast an unusual, eye-catching design that stands out from the crowd, and intuitive controls that make using them a breeze. The biggest drawback with these headphones is the price, which is why any Black Friday AirPods Max deals will be so welcome. They cost $549 / \u00a3549 at launch, which is much pricier than high-spec rivals like the Sony WF-1000XM4 . They also don't come with a 3.5mm audio jack, which will be a problem if you're hoping to use them with a wired connection; to get the most out of these headphones, you need to be pretty committed to the wider Apple ecosystem and to wireless listening. Still, the AirPods Max are well worth looking out for this Black Friday. They've been on the market for about a year now, and we've recently seen prices fall to $449 /\u00a3399 - bringing them closer to much of the competition in terms of price. Those prices could easily fall even lower come November 26, too. Read more: Apple AirPods Max review The second-generation AirPods may have been usurped by the AirPods 3, but they haven't been discontinued by Apple - in fact, the company has slashed the price from $159 / \u00a3159 to $129 / \u00a3119. In last year's Black Friday sales you could get the AirPods 2 for just $99 / \u00a399 - and we think prices will fall even further this year. Bear in mind, that's for the AirPods with the standard charging case - you can expect to pay a bit more for the wireless charging case. While the AirPods 2 are the best AirPods you can buy, they still sport some excellent features. Their lively sound is ideal for listening to pop music and podcasts, while their H1 chip makes them super easy to use with other Apple devices.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin As well as being ideal for podcasts, the AKG Ara is perfect for singers and instrumentalists. AKG There\u2019s been an explosion in the number of podcasts being produced over the past few years. There\u2019s some great content available now and almost anyone with a good idea can upload their show and be potentially address a massive audience. Not only can podcasts be monetized, but they also allow us to communicate with a much wider audience than traditional communication methods can manage. Getting started in podcasting couldn\u2019t be easier or more affordable. All you need is a great idea and an engaging way of speaking or interviewing. When it comes to equipment, you can make a podcast for very little investment using a good microphone and some audio editing software, such as the free Audacity package. When it comes to microphones, I think it\u2019s worth paying a little extra to get something that will capture your voice clearly because nothing puts podcast audiences off more than poor sound quality. Fortunately, a good USB microphone needn\u2019t cost much more than $100 or so and there are plenty of great models on the market. The AKG Ara has softer lines than the AKG Ara but they share a similar theme and color scheme. AKG This month, I\u2019ve been testing the AKG Ara USB microphone that follows on from AKG\u2019s excellent Lyra model. The Ara looks a little like the Lyra but has softer lines and is smaller. Ara is a versatile microphone that can be used for a solo voice or switched to an Omni pickup pattern so only one microphone is needed for recording more than one person. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event The AKG Ara is a dual-pattern USB condenser microphone that enables content creators and musicians to capture studio-quality sound at settings up to 24-bit at 96kHz for excellent clarity. The two pickup patterns can switch from close focus on a single source or it can be switched to pick up the sound of everyone and everything in a room. Ara\u2019s front cardioid polar pattern can capture any sound directly in front of it while efficiently filtering out sounds from either side. This pattern makes the Ara ideal for podcast hosts, gaming use, video meetings as well as recording vocals and instruments. The Front & Back (Omni) pattern can pick up sound from all sides, making it ideal for recording interviews with multiple speakers. The base of the AKG Ara houses a USB port for connecting to a computer, plus a 3.5mm stereo ... [+] headphone jack for monitoring playback with zero latency. AKG Like some other USB microphones, the AKG Ara includes a 3.5mm stereo headphone jack for zero-latency monitoring. The headphones relay the sound of what the microphone is picking up and those sounds are also fed to the computer that Ara is connected to. The computer can be used to play backing tracks while the microphone captures the live sound in the room, and the musician or vocalist gets to hear that along with the singer or instrument's sound. This makes the Ara ideal for multitrack recording. The same principle can be used when talking to someone remotely via Zoom, Skype or Facetime during a live chat or when recording an interview for a podcast. Only the essential functions that are needed for recording with Ara are included. There is a knob for switching between the two pickup patterns, as well as a mute button and a volume knob. The pattern selection we\u2019ve already covered but the mute button does exactly what it says and is particularly useful when streaming live or on a call and the speaker needs to cough or clear their throat. You can use the AKG Ara for gaming thanks to its zero latency monitoring. AKG The volume knob does exactly what it says, enabling the user to adjust the headphone volume levels of the sound from the microphone and the hose computer. There\u2019s no monitor mix knob for balancing the levels between the computer and the microphone. I would like to have seen mix control so the emphasis can be switched between the two sound sources, although it\u2019s possible to achieve a similar effect by adjusting the microphone input and headphone volume levels on the computer. The sound quality of Ara is extremely good. It has a rich and warm tone, especially when close to the speaker\u2019s voice. The headphone output and the microphone have no discernable hiss, The condenser capsule is very sensitive and can pick up the slightest of sounds. The Ara is one of the nicest USB mics I\u2019ve used in a while and, for the money, it\u2019s a genuine bargain. The headphone amplifier offers plenty of volume and, once again, hardly any discernable hiss. AKG has done a great job with this microphone and will give AKG\u2019s competitors \u2013 Blue and Audio-Technica \u2013 some competition. The AKG Ara can record with a front pickup pattern or an omnidirectional pattern. AKG The Ara microphone has a compact footprint about the size of a circular drink coaster. The microphone can be unscrewed from its foot and mounted on a boom arm or any other type of microphone stand. Included in the box is a 2m USB-C to USB-A cable, plus a 3/8-inch to 5/8-inch threaded mic stand adapter. There\u2019s also a registration card for downloading a free copy of Ableton Live 11 Lite recording software. However, you\u2019re not limited to just that package as Ara will work with all major live-streaming, video conferencing and music-recording applications. Verdict: The AKG Ara is a superb USB microphone with zero-latency monitoring and two pickup patterns that can easily record more than one source at the same time. This is important when recording with a USB microphone as it\u2019s not that easy to connect two USB microphones at the same time unless you use something like the R\u00d8DE NT Mini and R\u00d8DE Connect software. If you\u2019re looking for a super-sensitive USB microphone with plenty of warmth and a built-in amplifier that can drive a wide range of headphones, the AKG Ara is a winner. It looks great, too.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Getty Images Here are five things in technology that happened this past week and how they affect your business. Did you miss them? 1 \u2014The most expensive MacBook Pro will set you back $6,099. This past week, Apple revealed its new MacBook Pro. The new laptop comes in both a 14 and 16 inch and features new M1 Max and M1 Pro chips. The base cost for the 14-inch is $1,000 and it has a 512GB SSD and 16GB of RAM. The base cost for the 16 inch is $2,499 and it has 1TB SSD and 16GB of RAM. However, for users who would want to get the top-notch options for the laptop such as 8TB SSD and 64GB of RAM, the additions would bring the total to an astounding $6,099. (Source: Laptop Mag ) Why this is important for your business: My take: you get what you pay for. If your business relies heavily on technology that needs to handle significant graphic, design and processing demands then the extra money is probably well worth it. 2 \u2014 Paychex added support for vaccination status tracking to its COVID-19 solutions. Paychex, Inc. \u2014which provides businesses with insurance, benefits, payroll, and human resources services\u2014 shared that it has developed a function that will help businesses track employee vaccination status. This change comes as part of the enhancement of its Paychex Flex Document Management feature. Employees who are vaccinated will be able to digitally upload a copy of their vaccine card. Employees who are not vaccinated will have the ability to continually upload COVID test results as needed. (Source: WIBW ) Why this is important for your business: Disclosure: Paychex is a client of my company, The Marks Group. But no, I\u2019m not being compensated to report on this public news. I\u2019m bringing attention to this because Paychex, and other payroll and HR service providers, are stepping up their technologies to help small and mid-sized businesses with their COVID compliance requirements. If your business is facing these regulations then you should reach out to your payroll provider for help.

Facebook recently announced that it is planning to hire 10,000 employees throughout the next 5 years in the European Union.

According to Facebook, the hired workers will assist in developing what is being called \u201cthe metaverse\u201d which will utilize virtual and augmented reality to connect users online.

It has been reported that hackers committing cyber-attacks using ransomware have shared complaints that the source in which they get the malware is potentially stealing ransom payments. The organization behind one of the most common and notorious forms of ransomware\u2014 REvil\u2014 rents out their ransomware to other hackers and requires a piece of the profit in return. However, it was revealed recently that a little-known piece of code lets REvil restore the hacked files without the attackers renting the ransomware. (Source: ZDNet ) Why this is important for your business: How great is this story? Crooks stealing from crooks. Hopefully this behavior will limit some of their activities but probably not. So in the meantime: get your employees trained, use backup software, invest in up-to-date security software and most importantly keep everyone\u2019s operating systems \u2013 Windows, iOS, Android \u2013 up to date. 5\u2014Scammers cloned an exec\u2019s voice and stole $35M from a bank. A court document released in the United Arab Emirates revealed details of a bank heist which cost a bank $35 million. According to the document, a manager at a Dubai bank got a phone call where the caller claimed to be the director of the company and said that $35 million was needed to seal an acquisition deal. The bank manager also received emails that looked to be sent from the director\u2019s lawyer who was assisting with the deal. However, it was later revealed that scammers used \u201cdeep voice\u201d technology to duplicate the director\u2019s voice in order to carry out the heist. (Source: Newser ) Why this is important for your business: This is a concern. While much of the media has been paying attention to \u201cdeep fake\u201d videos that can alter the content of a video, there hasn\u2019t been as much concern about \u201cdeep voice.\u201d And yet it\u2019s this type of technology that can really harm businesses. What would your employee do if a genuine impersonator called and told them to transfer money from the business? Immediately comply? This is something that needs attention.",

(Image Source: The Indian Express/ Chetan Nayak) The top bezel and chin are slightly thicker than the side bezels, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s too thick. iQOO also has upgraded to a punch-hole display instead of the dated waterdrop notch on the Z3, which is a great addition. Display : Yes, this is not an AMOLED panel but we do get a good IPS LCD panel. While you miss out on punchy AMOLED colours, what you do get is variable refresh rate modes that you can lock to 60Hz, 90Hz or 120HZ, or even an auto-switch option that will dynamically change refresh rate. Considering this phone is targeted at gamers and power users, we don\u2019t think the lack of an AMOLED panel is a dealbreaker here. On the contrary, the IPS LCD panel you do get is pretty good. The phone comes with an IPS LCD panel. (Image Source: The Indian Express / Chetan Nayak) Performance : This is the first aspect you think of when you look at iQOO devices and it is here that the phone doesn\u2019t disappoint. The phone flies through day-to-day tasks, multiple apps as well as resource-heavy games. The Snapdragon 778G is not a flagship processor, but it gets close. With Battlegrounds Mobile India, for instance, you can play at Smooth graphics+Extreme framerates, while higher graphic settings will limit you to Ultra frame rates. These are the same settings offered by phones like the Poco F3 GT , which is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 1200. Gaming itself was great and we barely experienced any hiccups. The phone does get slightly warm during extended sessions, but not too hot. The iQOO Z5 features a decent overall camera setup for the price. (Image Source: The Indian Express/ Chetan Nayak) You also have LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 storage to ensure everything that you do or load on the device gets done quickly. You also get stereo speakers, performance and gaming modes and 240Hz touch sampling, which is great for the gamers out there. Software : One of our biggest issues with the older Z3 was its software, which offered a questionable experience full of privacy policies that popped up every two seconds and unwanted software forced down your throat. The Z5 gets a much cleaner iteration of FuntouchOS 12 (based on Android 11). The software experience is a big improvement. (Image Source: The Indian Express/ Chetan Nayak) You no longer have crazy notifications flying in, and while there is plenty of preinstalled junk, you can uninstall most of it. You can now finally hide the \u2018Hot Apps\u2019 and \u2018Hot Games\u2019 recommendations if you, like us, had no plans of checking it out. The company also promises two years of Android updates and three years of security updates. Other elements like the notification bar, the Settings app (which closely resembles OxygenOS 11 now) and the lockscreen are much cleaner than before too and feature handy tools and all the extra customisation features are neatly tucked under the settings. You still have a few basic elements missing though, like support for icon packs in the default launcher, but a third-party launcher can fix that easily. Overall, the software has now taken a big step in the right direction. Cameras : The iQOO Z5 features a decent overall camera setup for the price. You get crisp shots and colours look punchy. Capturing pictures is also pretty quick. Unfortunately, there is no OIS (optical image stabilisation) here, but the video performance is pretty decent regardless. Macro shots and Night Mode worked better than we expected. The 16MP front camera was good enough for selfies and calls, giving a satisfying experience even in low light scenarios. Check out our camera samples below. Battery life and charging : The iQOO Z5 features good battery life, and the 5,000mAh pack beats phones like its rival, the Xiaomi 11 Lite NE 5G. It is also significantly more juice than the iQOO Z3. While the phone has slower 44W fast charging, it is still pretty fast when it comes to topping off the battery. Even though the charging may feel slower than the iQOO Z3 due to the smaller battery and faster charging on the phone, we\u2019d pick the larger capacity battery on the iQOO Z5 anyday. iQOO Z5: What\u2019s not good? The iQOO Z5 doesn\u2019t get a lot wrong for its price and targeted market. The LCD screen is decent enough, but doesn\u2019t compare to an AMOLED display when it comes to contrast levels. The phone also misses out on NFC, a feature more and more people have begun appreciating with contactless payments becoming more popular. Even though the build quality of the whole phone felt solid to the touch, we found the volume rocker buttons to be quite wobbly, right from the day we unboxed the phone. Those looking for more 5G band support will also be disappointed as the phone supports just two bands \u2013 n77 and n78. Top Tech News Now iQOO Z5 review: Major improvement over the iQOO Z3 8 Apple products we are most excited about in 2022 Try these features on your smartphone as soon as you upgrade to Android 12 Click here for more Verdict: Is the iQOO Z5 for you? If you\u2019re looking for a value proposition that is more focused on speed and performance along with a relatively clean UI, the iQOO Z5 is a worthy consideration, even though it comes with a few cons. It is also a big improvement over the iQOO Z3. Among the Snapdragon 778G phones we have right now, it strikes a good balance between key elements like price, software, performance, design and camera quality. For gamers on a tight budget and power users, the iQOO Z5 is a good deal at Rs 23,990, but an even better one if you can grab the discount coupon and bank offers during the festive sales.",

    "full_description": "Science fiction novels and movies are packed with far-out ideas, most often as the springboard for an action-packed adventure rather than a serious attempt to predict future trends in science or technology. Some of the most common tropes, such as accelerating a spacecraft to fantastic speeds in a matter of seconds without crushing the occupants , are just plain impossible according to the laws of physics as we understand them. Yet those very same laws appear to permit other seemingly far-fetched sci-fi concepts, from wormholes to parallel universes. Here's a rundown of some of the sci-fi ideas that could really be done \u2014 in theory, at least. The idea of a wormhole \u2014a shortcut through space that allows almost instantaneous travel between distant parts of the universe \u2014 sounds like it was created as a fictional story-driver. But under its more formal name of an Einstein-Rosen bridge, the concept has existed as a serious theoretical concept long before sci-fi writers got hold of it. It comes out of Albert Einstein 's theory of general relativity , which views gravity as a distortion of space-time caused by massive objects. In collaboration with physicist Nathan Rosen, Einstein theorized in 1935 that points of extremely strong gravity, such as black holes , could be directly connected with each other. And so the idea of wormholes was born. The forces around a black hole would destroy anyone that came close to it, so the idea of actually traveling through a wormhole wasn't given serious consideration until the 1980s, when astrophysicist Carl Sagan decided he was going to write a sci-fi novel. According to the BBC , Sagan encouraged fellow physicist Kip Thorne to come up with a feasible way to travel interstellar distances in a flash. Thorne duly devised a way \u2014 possible in theory, but highly improbable in practice \u2014 that humans might achieve interstellar travel by traversing a wormhole unscathed. The result found its way into Sagan's novel \" Contact \" (Simon and Schuster: 1985) which was subsequently adapted into a film with Jodie Foster in the lead role. While it's highly unlikely that wormholes will ever become the simple and convenient methods of transportation portrayed in movies, scientists have now come up with a more viable way to construct a wormhole than Thorne's original suggestion. It's also possible that, if wormholes already exist in the universe, they could be located using the new generation of gravitational-wave detectors. An essential prerequisite for most space-based adventure stories is the ability to get from A to B much faster than we can today. Wormholes aside, there are multiple stumbling blocks to achieving this with a conventional spaceship. There's the enormous amount of fuel required, the crushing effects of acceleration, and the fact that the universe has a strictly imposed speed limit . This is the speed at which light travels \u2014 precisely one light-year per year, which in a cosmic context isn't very fast at all. Proxima Centauri, the second-closest star to Earth, is 4.2 light-years from the sun, while the center of the galaxy is a whopping 27,000 light-years away. Fortunately, there's a loophole in the cosmic speed limit: It only dictates the maximum speed we can travel through space . As Einstein explained, space itself can be distorted, so perhaps it's possible to manipulate the space around a ship in such a way as to subvert the speed limit. The spaceship would still travel through the surrounding space at less than the speed of light, but the space itself would be moving faster than that. This was what the writers of \"Star Trek\" had in mind when they came up with the concept of a \"warp drive\" in the 1960s. But to them it was just a plausible-sounding phrase, not real physics. It wasn't until 1994 that theoretician Miguel Alcubierre found a solution to Einstein's equations that produced a real warp drive effect, Live Science's sister site Space.com reported , contracting space in front of a spaceship and expanding it to the rear. To start with, Alcubierre's solution was no less contrived than Thorne's traversable wormhole, but scientists are attempting to refine it in the hope that it might one day be practical. The concept of a time machine is one of the great sci-fi plot devices, allowing characters to go back and change the course of history \u2014 for better or worse. But this inevitably raises logical paradoxes. In \"Back to the Future,\" for example, would Doc have built his time machine if he hadn't been visited by the future Marty using that very same machine? It's because of paradoxes like these that many people assume time travel must be impossible in the real world \u2014 and yet, according to the laws of physics, it really can occur . Just like with wormholes and space warps, the physics that tells us it's possible to travel back in time comes from Einstein's theory of general relativity. This treats space and time as part of the same \"space-time\" continuum, with the two being inextricably linked. Just as we talk about distorting space with a wormhole or warp drive, time can be distorted as well. Sometimes it can get so distorted that it folds back on itself, in what scientists refer to as a \" closed timelike curve \" \u2014 though it could just as accurately be called a time machine. A conceptual design for such a time machine was published in 1974 by physicist Frank Tipler, according to physicist David Lewis Anderson, who describes the research on the Anderson Institute , a private research lab. Called a Tipler cylinder, it has to be big \u2014 at least 60 miles (97 kilometers) long, according to Humble \u2014 and extremely dense, with a total mass comparable to that of the sun. To get it to function as a time machine, the cylinder has to rotate fast enough to distort space-time to the point where time folds back on itself. It may not sound as simple as installing a flux capacitor in a DeLorean, but it does have the advantage that it really would work \u2014 on paper, at least. The archetypal sci-fi example of teleportation is the \"Star Trek \" transporter, which, as the name suggests, is portrayed simply as a convenient way to transport personnel from one location to another. But teleportation is quite unlike any other form of transport: Instead of the traveler moving through space from the starting point to the destination, teleportation results in an exact duplicate being created at the destination while the original is destroyed. Viewed in these terms \u2014 and at the level of subatomic particles rather than human beings \u2014 teleportation is indeed possible, according to IBM . The real-world process is called quantum teleportation. This process copies the precise quantum state of one particle, such as a photon, to another that may be hundreds of miles away. Quantum teleportation destroys the quantum state of the first photon, so it does indeed look as though the photon has been magically transported from one place to another. The trick is based on what Einstein referred to as \"spooky action at a distance,\" but is more formally known as quantum entanglement . If the photon that is to be \"teleported\" is brought into contact with one of a pair of entangled photons, and a measurement of the resulting state is sent to the receiving end \u2014 where the other entangled photon is \u2014 then the latter photon can be switched into the same state as the teleported photon. It's a complicated process even for a single photon, and there's no way it could be scaled up to the kind of instant-transportation system seen in \"Star Trek.\" Even so, quantum teleportation does have important applications in the real world, such as for hack-proof communications and super-fast quantum computing. The universe is everything our telescopes reveal to us \u2014 all the billions of galaxies expanding outward from the Big Bang . But is that all there is? Theory says maybe not: There might be a whole multiverse of universes out there. The idea of \"parallel universes\" is another familiar sci-fi theme, but when they're depicted on screen they typically differ from our own universe only in minor details. But the reality may be much weirder than that, with the basic parameters of physics in a parallel universe \u2014 such as the strength of gravity or nuclear forces \u2014 differing from our own. A classic portrayal of a genuinely different universe of this kind, and the creatures living in it, is Isaac Asimov's novel \"The Gods Themselves \" ( Doubleday : 1972) . The key to the modern understanding of parallel universes is the concept of \"eternal inflation.\" This pictures the infinite fabric of space in a state of perpetual, incredibly rapid expansion. Every now and then a localized spot in this space \u2014 a self-contained Big Bang \u2014 drops out of the general expansion and begins to grow at a more sedate pace, allowing material objects like stars and galaxies to form inside it. According to this theory, our universe is one such region, but there may be countless others. As in Asimov's story, these parallel universes could have completely different physical parameters from our own. At one time scientists believed that only universes with virtually the same parameters as ours would be capable of supporting life, but recent studies suggest the situation may not be as restrictive as this, Live Science previously reported . So there's hope for Asimov's aliens yet \u2014 though perhaps not for making contact with them, as happens in the novel. Nevertheless, the traces of other universes might be detectable to us by other means. It's even been suggested that the mysterious \"cold spot\" in the cosmic microwave background is the scar from a collision with a parallel universe, Ivan Baldry, a professor of astrophysics at Liverpool John Moores University in the U.K. wrote in The Conversation .

Tesco are due to announce their Christmas trading results tomorrow. (Photo by Daniel Berehulak/Getty Images) Getty Images The website of Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket, Tesco, has been suffering from serious technical problems for more than 24 hours, preventing customers from placing online orders. Although the Tesco.com website is live and responsive, any attempt to place orders, or even look at goods to purchase, is met with an error message. The problems are not only affecting the website, but the Tesco app. Tesco shoppers can't get very far on its website Barry Collins Tesco\u2019s Twitter team admitted the company\u2019s website was suffering technical problems early on Saturday morning, U.K. time. However, more than 24 hours later, the website is still struggling, causing angst among Tesco customers who are seemingly unable to place new orders or even amend existing orders. Tesco\u2019s social media team has been inviting customers to send direct messages (DMs) if they wish to cancel or amend orders, but it seems the social media team is struggling to keep up with the volume of correspondence. \u201cCan someone respond to confirm my order is cancelled please,\u201d one customer tweeted on late Sunday morning, U.K. time. \u201cI DM'd as instructed yesterday and my order is due for collection in 50 minutes, but I won't be collecting as I've ordered from another store. Heard nothing back from you yet.\u201d MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event Customer complaints are being met with tweets explaining that \u201cour IT teams are working really hard to fix the issues as a priority\u201d. It\u2019s not clear what has caused such a prolonged outage for the supermarket. Tesco was unavailable for comment at the time of publication.",

    "full_description": "HELSINKI \u2014 China launched the Shijian-21 satellite from Xichang late Saturday with the stated aim of testing space debris mitigation technologies. A Long March 3B lifted off from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center, southwest China, at 9:27 p.m. Eastern, Oct. 23, sending Shijian-21 into geosynchronous transfer orbit. The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. (CASC) confirmed launch success within an hour of launch. Chinese state media Xinhua reported that Shijian-21 will \u201c test and verify space debris mitigation technologies.\u201d No details of the satellite or its capabilities were made available. Coupled with the fact that space debris mitigation technologies are \u201cdual-use,\u201d having both civilian and military applications, the satellite is likely to attract interest and scrutiny outside China. A commercial case for active debris removal and, in the case of geostationary orbit, repairing and refueling satellites or delivering them to graveyard orbits, is being made globally. The Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology unveiled a \u201csupplemental service spacecraft\u201d at the Zhuhai Airshow in late September. After approaching to within approximately two meters of a target it would be able to dock with and refuel a compatible satellite. SpaceLogistics, a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, has developed Mission Extension Vehicles , while DARPA, the European Space Agency, Astroscale of Japan and others are developing refueling spacecraft. The classified nature and lack of transparency regarding the intentions and actors involved in the Shijian-21 mission could spark concern, however. The same capabilities to rendezvous with and attach to a satellite for refueling and repair could also be used to disable spacecraft of adversaries. Shijian (\u201cpractice\u201d) satellites are broadly technology demonstration satellites. Shijian-17, launched by the first Long March 5 heavy-lift rocket in 2016, is an experimental satellite for communication and broadcast services. It also carried out rendezvous and proximity operations in geostationary orbit. The Secure World Foundation has tracked Chinese and other space actors\u2019 rendezvous and proximity operations. It notes that Shijian-17 has demonstrated maneuverability around the geostationary belt, circumnavigated Zhongxing-5A (ChinaSat-5A) and made later approaches to Zhongxing-6B and Shijian-20 , which launched in December 2019. The Saturday launch of the Long March 3B indicates that the launcher was not the cause of an issue affecting the Sept. 27 launch of Shiyan-10, another classified spacecraft. The satellite was apparently unresponsive in terms of propulsion for more than two weeks before a series of burns raised its perigee by hundreds of kilometers each time and indicated to the outside world that Shiyan-10 was active. Shiyan-10 continues to alter its orbit and has raised its perigee to 1,100 kilometers, according data from the U.S. Space Force\u2019s 18th Space Control Squadron (SPCS). The satellite is understood to have been targeting a geosynchronous orbit, with a current apogee of 40,100 km. Neither CASC nor state media have provided an update on the health or situation of the Shiyan-10 satellite. The Long March 3B was slated for a busy end to 2021, and appears fit to continue its role as a workhorse among China\u2019s Long March rockets. The launch was CASC\u2019s 36th launch of the year and 39th overall for China, including launches from state-owned spinoff Expace and private firm iSpace. China\u2019s next launch will set a national record for orbital launches in a calendar year, surpassing the 39 set in 2018 and matched in 2020. CASC is targeting more than 40 launches before the end of the year. Private firm Galactic Energy are soon expected to conduct their second launch, while Expace\u2019s efforts to launch a second Kuaizhou-1A record this year have been hit by a COVID-19 outbreak.",

    "full_description": "China has test fired a huge new solid rocket motor, creating more propulsion options for the country\u2019s growing space activities. The rocket motor was ignited Tuesday (Oct. 19) at a site near Xi'an city in north China, firing for 115 seconds, creating a tremendous trail of flame and exhaust. The new motor was developed by the Academy of Aerospace Solid Propulsion Technology (AASPT) which belongs to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), the country's main space contractor. The motor has a diameter of 11.48 foot (3.5 meters)1 and a maximum thrust of 1,00,000 pounds-force (500 tons) is powered by 330,000 pounds (150 tons) of solid fuel. A CASC statement said it is the most powerful solid rocket motor with the largest thrust in the world so far. Related: The latest news about China's space program It also proved multiple cutting-edge technologies, according to CASC, including a high-performance fiber composite shell, an integral-casting combustion chamber and an oversized nozzle, to make it a highly advanced rocket engine. \"Testing is very successful. We have tested all the parameters including the 500-ton thrust that worked 115 seconds,\" said Ren Quanbin, president of AASPT. \"We are at the international advanced level in the field of large solid rocket engines. Next, we will develop a 1,000-ton solid rocket engine to provide stronger thrust for China's carrier rockets in the future,\" Ren told CCTV . CASC says the rocket motor is expected to be used with heavy-lift rockets to meet various demands for launch vehicles during space missions like crewed Moon landings and deep space exploration. China is already developing the Long March 9 and another large rocket for launching astronauts for crewed lunar missions, neither of which include solid boosters. China has made big progress on solid propellant rockets in recent years, including the successful development and launch of the Long March 11 , which can launch from land or sea . AASPT also tested a (3.2 m) diameter solid engine in December 2020. However the new engine is much larger and could be added to launch vehicles to produce extra thrust. It could also be used by CASC commercial spinoff China Rocket, which develops Jielong solid rockets for launching commercial satellites. \u2014 The world's tallest rockets: How they stack up \u2014 How rockets work: A complete guide \u2014 The history of rockets China is also planning to launch its first rocket which combines liquid propellant core stages with solid side boosters. The Long March 6A could launch before the end of the year. CASIC, another gigantic Chinese state-owned enterprise similar to CASC and with its own space aspirations, is also developing small and large solid rockets . This comes at a time when many countries and companies, including China itself, are developing reusable liquid propellant rockets. After the first stages have done their job, engines for these new launchers are able to reignite to guide the first stage back towards a landing area and burn once more to make a powered descent and vertical landing. In this way the rockets can be recovered and reused, reducing launch costs. Solid rockets however cannot be controlled in the same way, and once ignited they burn until all propellant is used up. They are however more simple than liquid rockets and offer their own advantages in cost and production. China's new solid rocket motor It is not the largest nor most powerful solid fuel engine ever tested, however. In the 1960s, Aerojet developed and test fired the SL-260, with \u201c260\u201d referring to its diameter in inches, or 21.60 ft (6.60 m). It was designed for NASA to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing large SRMs for space exploration, but was not used. Follow us on Twitter @Spacedotcom or Facebook .",

    "full_description": "A Facebook whistleblower whose claims have rocked the social media giant has launched a fresh attack on Mark Zuckerberg, accusing him of not being willing to protect public safety. The latest broadside by former employee Frances Haugen comes as she prepares to give evidence to MPs at Westminster. Her intervention ramps up the pressure on the embattled $1trn (\u00a3750bn) company, which has been plunged into a crisis since she released thousands of pages of internal research documents secretly copied before leaving her job in the firm's civic integrity unit. It comes amid newspaper reports that workers repeatedly warned Facebook was being flooded with misinformation claiming that the 2020 US presidential election result was being rigged. Workers reportedly believed more should have been done to tackle it. It has fuelled renewed concerns about Facebook's role in the 6 January Capitol riots , in which a mob seeking to overturn the election result stormed Congress. Separate leaked documents also reveal Facebook in India wavered in curbing hate speech and anti-Muslim content on its platform and lacked enough local language moderators to stop misinformation, which at times sparked violence. Facebook fined \u00a350m for 'refusing to comply' with regulator Facebook reportedly planning to rebrand the company with name change Facebook plans to hire 10,000 people in Europe to build its metaverse Criticising Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a interview with The Observer newspaper, Ms Haugen said: \"Right now, Mark is unaccountable. \"He has all the control. \"He has no oversight, and he has not demonstrated that he is willing to govern the company at the level that is necessary for public safety.\" She said she had leaked the documents because she realised the company would not change otherwise. Ms Haugen made her comments ahead of facing questions from a UK parliamentary committee scrutinising the draft Online Safety Bill, which aims to regulate tech firms and social media in a bid to curb cyber abuse and threats. She has already levelled a series allegations against the social network, saying its platforms \"harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy\", and that it refused to act because executives put profits above safety. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Ms Haugen has also accused the tech giant of being aware of the apparent harm Instagram could have on some teenagers and their body image, and said the firm had been dishonest in its public fight against hate content and misinformation by concealing research that showed it amplified such content. Mr Zuckerberg has rejected the claims made by Ms Haugen, saying her attacks on the company were \"misrepresenting\" the work it does and that it \"cares deeply about issues like safety, well-being and mental health\". He added: \"At the heart of these accusations is this idea that we prioritise profit over safety and well-being. That's just not true.\" Follow the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts or Spotify. Facebook is reportedly planning to rebrand its business name in an apparent bid to distance its wider business from the string of controversies that have engulfed it in recent years. Among its latest big ideas is the so-called metaverse, a 3D online world the firm wants to lead the way on building, in which people can meet, play and work virtually, often using virtual reality headsets.",

The new MacBook Pros arrive with a flat-edge design; this replaces the curves to bring the MacBook Pro in the design language similar to the iPhone 13 launched in September. A striking change on the MacBook Pro display is the presence of a notch. While the redesign of the laptop was on the cards; there was no information regarding this surprising notch inclusion, which makes the MacBook Pro just identical to the recent iPhones. The display is further beefed up on the MacBook Pro with mini-LED panel boasting 120Hz refresh rate, thanks to the ProMotion technology. These laptops on the inside are powered with the state-of-the-art M1 Pro and M1 Max chips. The refreshed in-house processors are the biggest takeaways from the new MacBook Pros. These come with a greater core count and enhanced graphics performance. The ports on the MacBook Pro through the years have been a letdown, which Apple has taken note of and has included more variety of ports this time. It now comes with an HDMI, Thunderbolt 4, SD card slot and supports MagSafe charging. Arguably, with the given features, the MacBook Pro 14-inch is perhaps the best handy laptop on the market right now but the $2,000 tag \u2013 it starts at \u2013 is not for everyone to digest. If you\u2019re in the market for the best option for browsing, productivity and some gaming, there are many Windows laptops you can explore. When choosing the best laptop from the others, a good blend of portability, power and efficiency is a must. But in addition to these, the price is also a point of contention for many users. Comprising a blend of it all, below are some laptops with better value than MacBook Pro 2021 that should suit creators, business users and students demanding power from their machines. Dell XPS 13 is a direct competitor to the MacBook Pro 2021. It comes in 13-inch and 15-inch models with near bezel-less InfinityEdge LCD touchscreen and an attractive design. Powered by Intel\u2019s latest and greatest Core-i3, i5, and i7 processors, the XPS 13 arrives with 8GB to 32GB of RAM and offers a selection of SSD storage \u2013 starting at 256GB capacity. Intel Iris Xe Graphics drives the display which comes in InfinityEdge OLED option as well \u2013 offering richer colors and better contrast \u2013 but for a $300 premium from the standard model. The very durable Dell XPS 13 features CNC machined aluminum chassis with choice of either carbon fiber or frost-finish palm rest. The laptop\u2019s battery life stretches over 10 hours and for the ones who are more interested in a convertible, XPS 13 2-in-1 is also a great pick. Dell XPS 13 comes in different configurations for you to choose from. That means you can select according to the choice of hardware and specs your routine may demand starting at around $1,000. Most interestingly, all configurations of the laptop arrive with the same keyboard, speakers, ports and touchpad, which ensure your choice comes down to the memory, storage and processor and you get your preference without overspending. The ASUS ZenBook 13 OLED UX325 is one of the lightest and most portable OLED laptops on the market starting at $799.99. The exceptionally thin device is finished in glossy gray metal chassis and is powered by the choice of Intel 11th generation processors. The 13.3-inch OLED 1920 x 1080 Full HD panel has limited 400 nits of brightness, but it\u2019s powered by Intel Iris Xe Graphics. The display features only 2.9mm bezel and the ASUS laptop tips the scale at 2.45 pounds. With stellar performance from 11th gen Intel Core i5 or Core i7 processor paired with up to 16GB RAM and up to 512GB SSD; the Asus ZenBook 13 is an outstanding blend of maximum performance in a lightweight design. The newly designed keyboard \u2013 from the previous ZenBook 13 \u2013 features a large trackpad and thanks to an ErgoLift hinge, can be raised up slightly for comfortable typing angle when the screen is opened. The ASUS ZenBook 13 OLED UX325 lasts for up to 13 hours on a single charge and comes with a 65W adaptor in the box. It can connect with up to three external displays using HDMI and two Thunderbolt 4 ports and also features microSD card reader and ASUS\u2019s USB-C charging system. Razor laptops are prominently known for their gaming skills; but the Razer Book 13 with configuration options for ones who want to engage in multitasking, is a high-performance device to look for in comparison to the MacBook Pro. The 13.4-inch display of the Razor Book 13 features an extremely thin bezel and supports a tall 16:10 aspect ratio. The display is offered in Full HD+ or Ultra HD+ options with touch support. Beginning at $1,199.99, this Razor laptop is cut out from a single piece aluminum and offered in white anodized finish. The ultra-productivity laptop is powered by a choice of 11th generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, integrated Intel Iris Xe Graphics, and starts at 8GB of RAM and 256GB PCIe SSD storage. Users can pick from up to 16GB of RAM and up to 512GB SSD storage. The Razor Book 13 arrives with enough connection options including HDMI 2.0, two Thunderbolt 4, microSD card slot and a 3.5mm headphone jack. For connectivity, like every productivity laptop, you get Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1 support and according to Razor it features two booming speakers and has a glass touchpad. HP Spectre x360 14 is a capable MacBook Pro competitor, more so because it even weighs heavy on the Dell XPS, a few performance tests indicate. One of the best 2-in-1 laptops right now, the HP Spectre x360 14 arrives in a durable body with a premium appearance. Its 13.5-inch display with 3:2 aspect ratio is designed to increase user productivity. The users can choose either between the base 1920 x 1280 IPS display or upgrade to the 3000 x 2000 OLED display for more colors and contrast. Spectre x360 14 is not just premium in appearance, it is a pleasurable productivity laptop whose guts are powered by 11th generation Intel core i5 or i7 processors and integrated Iris Xe Graphics. The laptop comes with at least 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, which can be customized to preference. Available in Nightfall Black and Natural Silver hues, the convertible laptop is slightly on the larger side yet it feels premium in the hand. It offers about 10 hours of battery backup and is provided with a stylus that attaches magnetically to the side of the laptop and lets you get creative when the Spectre is used as a tablet. Starting at $1,150, the HP Spectre x360 14 has enough ports, comfortable trackpad and keyboard, and delivers exceptional audio. Presenting the HP Spectre x360 14 a serious competition in the convertible domain and giving the expensive MacBook Pro a run for its money; Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio arrives as a versatile performance machine that flips into studio or tablet form factor to be used with a Surface Pen. The interesting two-tiered design of the laptop makes it slightly thinker than most Surface devices, while it\u2019s the tilting display that renders the laptop a little flimsy but gives us different ways to position the screen. You get a smooth hepatic trackpad that\u2019s exceptional to use. Its feedback intensity can be configured from settings. The keyboard however on the Surface Laptop Studio is similar to other Surface laptops, while the 14.4-inch, 120Hz PixelSense flow touchscreen sets it in the league of its own. The 3:2 aspect ratio display supports 10-point multi-touch and Dolby Vision but it lacks an anti-glare layer. Ideal for business use, creative work and a lot of media consumption, the Surface Laptop Studio runs Windows 11 out of the box, which gives it very integrated experience. The laptop in its base configuration comprises Intel Core i5, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD and starts at $1,599.99; it also comes in high-end Intel Core i7, 32GB RAM, and 1TB SSD configuration.",

    "description": "Clinicians, researchers and healthcare professionals will be able to reconnect at the annual meeting of American Society for Radiation Oncology, which will be held as an in-person event in Chicago, Illinois The post ASTRO convenes in-person conference for the cancer care community appeared first on Physics World.",
    "content": "The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) will once again welcome delegates to its annual meeting, which is due to take place in Chicago, IL, on 24\u201327 October 2021. Thousands of oncologists, clinicians, researchers and healthcare professionals are expected to come together to share knowledge and experience, and to reconnect with colleagues and friends at an in-person event. \u201cThe ASTRO Annual Meeting will be the first major medical conference held in Chicago since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said ASTRO president Laura A Dawson. \u201cWe are working closely with the city of Chicago and local planners to ensure that safety protocols are in place to foster a healthy, safe and engaging learning experience for attendees.\u201d Those unable to attend in person can still access all the presentations through ASTRO Digital XP, a virtual meeting platform that includes live interactive sessions, recorded presentations and Q&A from the live meeting, plus additional original programming that will feature a keynote presentation as well as extra scientific sessions. All the content on Digital XP will be available to view until 30 November. The theme for the meeting will be \u201cEmbracing change, advancing person-centred care\u201d, with the Presidential Symposium focusing on how to exploit rapid advancements in the field to provide the best patient care in the most efficient ways. Around this theme, some 1500 scientific presentations highlighting new results from clinical trials and other research studies will be presented, alongside educational panels, keynote addresses and other special sessions. More than 160 exhibitors will also make their way to Chicago\u2019s McCormick Place to showcase their latest technologies for cancer care. Attendees will be able to network with industry partners, view product demonstrations, and ask questions about new products and trends on the horizon. Some of the latest innovations are highlighted below. Motion phantom delivers end-to-end quality assurance The QUASAR Respiratory Motion Phantom (pRESP) from Modus QA is a programmable breathing and tumour 3D motion simulator that enables end-to-end quality assurance (QA) on motion-guided radiation therapy systems such as CT, LINAC and PET. The phantom makes it easy to adjust the motion frequency and amplitude in real time using a local manual control at the motor, while more complex patient-specific waveforms can be created, imported and played back with the advanced programmable motion software. The QUASAR Respiratory Motion Phantom from Modus QA combines simple design with comprehensive testing capabilities. (Courtesy: Modus QA) Versatile and interchangeable inserts are available for imaging, planning, targeting, dosimetry and delivery QA. The pRESP also features a vertical chest-wall surrogate that is compatible with various third-party tracking systems for motion-guided radiotherapy. With more than 1100 units in use worldwide, Modus says that the QUASAR pRESP is a proven motion QA solution that has solidified its reputation as a trusted, efficient and cost-effective tool for respiratory motion management. SRS phantom enables fast and accurate measurement of multiple lesions The NavPhan phantom has been optimized for testing and commissioning systems for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and the novel technique of single-isocentre multi-target (SIMT) SRS, which enables multiple lesions to be treated more rapidly. The phantom enables accurate end-to-end testing, QA for image-guided radiotherapy with six degrees-of-freedom, and patient-specific measurements in a single device. NavPhan is the first product to be launched by NavAxis, a medical device start-up specializing in radiation oncology QA. The NavPhan phantom from medical device start-up NavAxis enables multiple lesions to be measured quickly and accurately. (Courtesy: NavAxis) NavPhan\u2019s patented design allows the user to measure any distribution of targets directly using full composite delivery. The workflow allows accurate measurement of the dose for the smallest of targets, whether they are on- or off-axis. Since three targets are guaranteed to be measured per delivery, the system is three times more efficient during measurement than other planar devices. The NavPhan can achieve a set-up accuracy of less than 0.2 mm and below 0.1\u00b0 both in terms of dose plane extraction and during the measurement. Exactly aligning the measurement plane with the one extracted from the dose distribution eliminates a common source of error in small-field QA that can often require the measurements to be taken again. Phantom offers end-to-end verification for stereotactic treatments Stereotactic radiosurgery requires a high degree of accuracy in both target localization and dose delivery. Small errors can result in significant undertreatment of regions within the tumour volume, or overdose of nearby healthy tissues. The Stereotactic End-to-End Verification Phantom (STEEV) from CIRS offers a way to check all the necessary steps of a treatment planning system \u2013 from diagnostic imaging with CT, MR and PET, to verification of the treatment plan. STEEV\u2019s anthropomorphic exterior allows multiple positioning and fixation devices to be used, while internal details such as cortical and trabecular bone, brain, spinal cord, teeth, sinuses and trachea provide the most realistic clinical simulation for different anatomies. The STEEV phantom from CIRS comes with a range of geometric and organic inserts to enable comprehensive testing for stereotactic radiosurgery. (Courtesy: CIRS) Geometric and organic target inserts offer comprehensive testing for different imaging modalities as well as machine QA and treatment planning. These include a variety of interchangeable tissue equivalent inserts that are suitable for small-field dosimetry, enabling dose measurements at both isocentre and off-isocentre positions. Sun Nuclear highlights integrated and independent QA solutions With the ever-increasing demands on the resources available for radiation therapy, both independence and integration are needed for effective quality management.

    "full_description": "Clinicians, researchers and healthcare professionals will be able to reconnect at the annual meeting of American Society for Radiation Oncology, which will be held as an in-person event in Chicago, Illinois The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) will once again welcome delegates to its annual meeting, which is due to take place in Chicago, IL, on 24\u201327 October 2021. Thousands of oncologists, clinicians, researchers and healthcare professionals are expected to come together to share knowledge and experience, and to reconnect with colleagues and friends at an in-person event. \u201cThe ASTRO Annual Meeting will be the first major medical conference held in Chicago since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said ASTRO president Laura A Dawson. \u201cWe are working closely with the city of Chicago and local planners to ensure that safety protocols are in place to foster a healthy, safe and engaging learning experience for attendees.\u201d Those unable to attend in person can still access all the presentations through ASTRO Digital XP, a virtual meeting platform that includes live interactive sessions, recorded presentations and Q&A from the live meeting, plus additional original programming that will feature a keynote presentation as well as extra scientific sessions. All the content on Digital XP will be available to view until 30 November. The theme for the meeting will be \u201cEmbracing change, advancing person-centred care\u201d, with the Presidential Symposium focusing on how to exploit rapid advancements in the field to provide the best patient care in the most efficient ways. Around this theme, some 1500 scientific presentations highlighting new results from clinical trials and other research studies will be presented, alongside educational panels, keynote addresses and other special sessions. More than 160 exhibitors will also make their way to Chicago\u2019s McCormick Place to showcase their latest technologies for cancer care. Attendees will be able to network with industry partners, view product demonstrations, and ask questions about new products and trends on the horizon. Some of the latest innovations are highlighted below. The QUASAR Respiratory Motion Phantom (pRESP) from Modus QA is a programmable breathing and tumour 3D motion simulator that enables end-to-end quality assurance (QA) on motion-guided radiation therapy systems such as CT, LINAC and PET. The phantom makes it easy to adjust the motion frequency and amplitude in real time using a local manual control at the motor, while more complex patient-specific waveforms can be created, imported and played back with the advanced programmable motion software. Versatile and interchangeable inserts are available for imaging, planning, targeting, dosimetry and delivery QA. The pRESP also features a vertical chest-wall surrogate that is compatible with various third-party tracking systems for motion-guided radiotherapy. With more than 1100 units in use worldwide, Modus says that the QUASAR pRESP is a proven motion QA solution that has solidified its reputation as a trusted, efficient and cost-effective tool for respiratory motion management. The NavPhan phantom has been optimized for testing and commissioning systems for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and the novel technique of single-isocentre multi-target (SIMT) SRS, which enables multiple lesions to be treated more rapidly. The phantom enables accurate end-to-end testing, QA for image-guided radiotherapy with six degrees-of-freedom, and patient-specific measurements in a single device. NavPhan is the first product to be launched by NavAxis, a medical device start-up specializing in radiation oncology QA. NavPhan\u2019s patented design allows the user to measure any distribution of targets directly using full composite delivery. The workflow allows accurate measurement of the dose for the smallest of targets, whether they are on- or off-axis. Since three targets are guaranteed to be measured per delivery, the system is three times more efficient during measurement than other planar devices. The NavPhan can achieve a set-up accuracy of less than 0.2 mm and below 0.1\u00b0 both in terms of dose plane extraction and during the measurement. Exactly aligning the measurement plane with the one extracted from the dose distribution eliminates a common source of error in small-field QA that can often require the measurements to be taken again. Stereotactic radiosurgery requires a high degree of accuracy in both target localization and dose delivery. Small errors can result in significant undertreatment of regions within the tumour volume, or overdose of nearby healthy tissues. The Stereotactic End-to-End Verification Phantom (STEEV) from CIRS offers a way to check all the necessary steps of a treatment planning system \u2013 from diagnostic imaging with CT, MR and PET, to verification of the treatment plan. STEEV\u2019s anthropomorphic exterior allows multiple positioning and fixation devices to be used, while internal details such as cortical and trabecular bone, brain, spinal cord, teeth, sinuses and trachea provide the most realistic clinical simulation for different anatomies. Geometric and organic target inserts offer comprehensive testing for different imaging modalities as well as machine QA and treatment planning. These include a variety of interchangeable tissue equivalent inserts that are suitable for small-field dosimetry, enabling dose measurements at both isocentre and off-isocentre positions. With the ever-increasing demands on the resources available for radiation therapy, both independence and integration are needed for effective quality management.

    "full_description": "Sundays are for nearly having a heart attack when the toaster pops. Before you jolt awake, let's read this week's best writing about games. The folks over at ChaoyangTrap wrote about the popularity of Steam in China and how it's the only platform which hasn't been hit by Chinese censors . Chen Guanpeng\u2019s game Booth is a perfect example of the kind of fascinating and idiosyncratic games that have been able to emerge in this market. Set in a dystopian world grappling with dire food scarcity, the game casts the player as a food inspector stuck in an isolated booth, checking food products being imported along a conveyor belt into their country. Your only escape from the daily grind of work is the relationships you can form with the three different girls who deliver meals to you, but you later discover that even your personal interactions with them are being used as a method of control and surveillance by your government. It\u2019s not a perfect game, but it\u2019s a truly interesting one with a compelling story invested with player choice. For Fanbyte, Jocelyn Monahan wrote about the growth of Final Fantasy XIV roleplaying venues . To Chihaya, who runs a tavern called the Inkwell, regulars are the part that\u2019s \u201cworth the effort to keep going.\u201d Like the Gin Ironic, the Inkwell is a comfy spot with its own set of quirks: they regularly host a fight night and have a bartender with an unfortunate tendency to set things on fire. Talon feels similarly; regulars are what keep them open every single evening. While both players acutely feel the stress of running a venue \u2060\u2014 as Talon says, it\u2019s \u201cmentally taxing\u201d\u2060 \u2014 it\u2019s the persistent communities they\u2019ve built that keep them going. For Real Life Mag, Tony Tulathimutte wrote about how Clash Rules Everything Around Them . So the most interesting thing about Clash isn\u2019t how it\u2019s an allegory for late capitalism. (Isn\u2019t everything? Isn\u2019t that the point?) It\u2019s that Clash makes especially clear how everything is interchangeable under such a system. Time is life is work is death is money is property is time. Technology fuzzes the distinction between real and virtual. Like almost every game with a death mechanic, the true currency of Clash isn\u2019t virtual gold but actual time. Dying in a game forces you to waste your time trying again, \u201cspending\u201d part of your limited lifespan on a failed effort. Money can help you enjoy your time in the game more, but there\u2019s no changing that every session brings you five minutes, a hundred thousand coins, and dozens of deaths closer to your death. For The Art Newspaper, Jos\u00e9 da Silva wrote about how museums are stepping up exhibition design . Will Guthrie, the lead architect for the show, explains that each gallery for the exhibition was designed to be a different size\u2014\u201dwe had points of compression and decompression\u201d\u2014and offer a distinctive environment to reflect the shifts in Lange\u2019s body of work and the narrative of her life. For example, the first room reflected Lange\u2019s early life and was painted a dark green, with domestic details like skirting boards, and a cut-out into the next gallery mimicking a window on the outside world. The latter was inspired by a story Lange told\u2014her \u201cepiphany\u201d, Guthrie calls it\u2014when she was running a photography studio in San Francisco. Looking out of the window, she saw an unemployed man as the Great Depression began to show on the streets of the city. She grabbed her camera and took to the street to photograph him, thus beginning her remarkable career. To round things off, People Make Games spoke to those who worked on the Mass Effect 3 endings which drew huge backlash at the time. Music this week is Major Happy by Fred V & Grafix. Here's the YouTube link and Spotify link . Psyching myself up for Forza Horizon 5's Hospital Records radio station with this DnB delight. I dare you to read the YouTube comments while it's playing and not shed a tear, good luck. That's me. Have a solid Sunday everyone!",

    "content": "Enlarge This week Apple introduced a set of new MacBook Pro laptops.

Though he\u2019s begun to appear on camera at recent Apple events, he generally avoids the spotlight. An Israeli-born engineer who previously worked at Intel and IBM, Srouji joined Apple in 2008, specifically to fulfill a mandate from Steve Jobs, who felt that the chips in the original iPhone couldn\u2019t meet his demands. Srouji\u2019s mission was to lead Apple in making its own silicon. The effort has been so well executed that I believe Srouji is secretly succeeding Jony Ive as the pivotal creative wizard whipping up the secret sauce in Apple\u2019s offerings. Srouji, of course, won\u2019t cop to that. After all, the playbook for Apple executives is to expend their hyperbole on Macs, iPhones, and iPads, not themselves. \u201cApple builds the best silicon in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I always keep in mind that Apple is first and foremost a product company. If you\u2019re a chip designer, this is heaven because you\u2019re building silicon for a company that builds products.\u201d Advertisement Srouji is clear on the advantages of rolling out your own chips, as opposed to buying from a vendor like Intel, which was summarily booted from MacBook Pros this week in favor of the M's. \u201cWhen you're a merchant vendor, a company that delivers off-the-shelf components or silicon to many customers, you have to figure what is the least common denominator\u2014what is it that everyone needs across many years?\u201d he says. \u201cWe work as one team\u2014the silicon, the hardware, the software, the industrial design, and other teams\u2014to enable a certain vision. When you translate that to silicon, that gives us a very unique opportunity and freedom because now you're designing something that is not only truly unique, but optimized for a certain product.\u201d In the case of the MacBook Pro, he says, he sat with leaders like Ternus and Craig Federighi several years ago and envisioned what users would be able to get their hands on in 2021. It would all spring from the silicon. \u201cWe sit together, and say, \u2018Okay, is it gated by physics? Or is it something we can go beyond?\u2019 And then, if it's not gated by physics and it's a matter of time, we go figure out how to build it.\u201d Think about that\u2014the only restraint Apple\u2019s chipmakers concede to is the physical boundary of what\u2019s possible. Srouji explained how his journey at Apple has been one of conscious iteration, building on a strong foundation. A key element of the company\u2019s strategy has been to integrate the functions that used to be distributed among many chips into a single entity\u2014known as SOC, or system-on-a-chip. \u201cI always fundamentally felt and believed that if you have the right architecture, then you have a chance to build the best chip,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we started with the architecture that we believe would scale. And by scaling, we mean scaling to performance and features and the power envelope, whether it's a watch or iPad or iMac. And then we started selectively figuring the technologies within the chip\u2014we wanted to start owning them one by one. We started with the CPU first. And then we went into the graphics. Then we went into signal processing, display engine, etcetera. Year over year, we built our engineering muscle and wisdom and ability to deliver. And a few years later, when you do all this and you do it right, you find yourself with really good architecture and IP you own and a team behind you that is now capable of repeating that recipe.\u201d Advertisement Ternus elaborates: \u201cTraditionally, you've got one team at one company designing a chip, and they have their own set of priorities and optimizations. And then the product team and another company has to take that chip and make it work in their design. With these MacBook Pros, we started all the way at the beginning\u2014the chip was being designed right when the system was being thought through. For instance, power delivery is important and challenging with these high-performance parts. By working together [early on], the team was able to come up with a solution. And the system team was actually able to influence the shape, aspect ratio, and orientation of the SOC so that it can best nest into the rest of the system components.\" (Maybe this helped convince Apple to restore the missing ports that so many had longed for in the previous MacBook.) Clearly these executives believe the new Macs represent a milestone in Apple\u2019s strategy. But not its last. I suggest that a future milestone might be silicon customized to enable an augmented reality system, producing the graphics intensity, precision geolocation, and low power consumption that AR spectacles would require. Predictably, the VPs did not comment on that. Before the conversation ends, I have to ask Joswiak about the now discontinued Touch Bar, the dynamic function-key feature that Apple launched with great fanfare five years ago but that never caught on. Not surprisingly, his postmortem spins it as a great gift to new users. \u201cThere's no doubt that our Pro customers love that full-size, tactile feel of those function keys, and so that's the decision we made. And we feel great about that,\u201d he says. He points out that for lovers of the Touch Bar, whoever they may be, Apple is still selling the 13-inch\u2014now obsolete\u2014version of the MacBook Pro with the soft keys intact. The tale of the Touch Bar reminds us that even the best silicon can\u2019t guarantee designers will make the right choices. But as Srouji notes, when done right, it can unleash an infinite number of innovations that could not otherwise exist. Maybe the most telling indicator of Apple\u2019s silicon success this week came not from the launch of the MacBook Pro, but in Google\u2019s unveiling of the Pixel 6 phone . Google boasted that the phone's key virtues sprang from a decision to follow the path Apple and Srouji forged 14 years ago in building the company's own chip , the Tensor processor. \u201cIs this a case of \u2018Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery?\u2019\u201d I ask the Apple team. \u201cYou took my line!\u201d says Joswiak. \u201cClearly, they think we\u2019re doing something right.\u201d \u201cIf you were to give Google or some other company friendly advice on their silicon journey, what would it be?\u201d I ask. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d says Joz. \u201cBuy a Mac.\u201d This story originally appeared on wired.com .",
